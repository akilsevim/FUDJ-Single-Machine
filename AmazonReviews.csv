"Very mobile product. Efficient. Easy to use; however product needs a varmint guard. Critters are able to gorge themselves without a guard."
"i do not suggest buying this product i thought it seemed nice and everything but it did not work when i removed it from the packaging. for this reason i do not trust the shipping methods that the seller uses."
"Useless  - ALL you need is a Good Diet , and 1 hour cardio everyday , These kind of thigs are useless"
"Its very colorful and the image once  you  put all de pieces in order is pretty  cute. The window looks terrific"
"Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  It is also easy to attach the wheels; it's ready to go in under 5 minutes."
"This book caught my eye, and when I read the sample, I was hooked. The final hook was one other reviewer explaining the unemotional aspect of the book's dramatic swings, because of the method of writing employed. (I have often been accused of being unemotional, or anti-sentimental... which is not true. People show these depths of feeling in many different ways--not all of us are weepers, people...) And The Call delivered. The emotion is there, and it's pretty raw at times, but it's emoted in unexpected ways. The characters cracked me up, felt very real, and the story was believable and at times serious, then light, then laugh-out-loud funny. I really enjoyed the writing style, and although it did take a few pages of adjustment, I was very glad I stuck with it. In the same way that Cormac MacCarthy's writing is at first difficult to take in, this was a little bit tough to &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; until I'd gotten through several pages. I have already recommended this to several people. Made me want to try writing again. : )"
"Sue (Zoo, as her buddy calls her) tells a sometimes upsetting, always heartening story of how she comes to know an elderly man who survived more than a life's worth of hurts, yet maintained his spirit and spark throughout. The story is written in a somewhat disjointed manner, jumping from era/scene to a completely different era/scene, but that matches the story b/c it mirrors how she came to know more about this friend. The information he shared was piecemeal, out of time, snippets that she had to piece together bit by bit. Worth the read for sure."
"Stunning look and I need a case that Showcase the complete look of my Iphone beautiful.This case suites me the best in looks."
"I don't ever read but this book changed me I love love this book I hated when I got to the last book I didn't want it to be over"
"The author has been there and done that when it comes to what he suggests. He was an Air Force SERE ( Survival Evasion Resistance Escape ) instructor for 30 years. His approach to the subject of survival is practical in that he does NOT approach the topic with primitive tool making or cutting trees down to make a shelter. His approach is quick, practical and effective. I highly recommend this book!"
"Cute"
"I bought this battery to replace the original battery for my Samsung SGH-I727 Galaxy II Skyrocket, and it works perfectly. I had to remove the sticker for the battery cover to close correctly, but I knew what I was getting myself into before I even bought it. The charge time takes a little longer, as expected, but having the extra battery life is well worth it."
"Loftek is an awesome product! I recently bought a IP camera loftek CXS2200 and was impressed at its practical function and Tech support. How easy it was to set up. Just follow the directions provided or go to their website. If ever you are having some issues, you can always contact them and you are guaranteed a response from them.My wife and I were so impressed that we bought another camera,we are setting it up so we can monitor our child at home even when we are away. The camera come with a factory ddns .It is very convininet for user to view the camera on our phone. Moreover it's hard to ignore it's alarm trigger and video recording trigger. I can receive a alarm email when someon break into my home.Big two thumps up! Cost and Quality is great!"
"Product is not long enough to secure to headrests in my 2013 dodge ram. Product seems like it is meant for small vehicles."
"The case feels a bit cheap but overall it's a nice case. A but hard to use when a call comes in but if you usually use headsets it won't be a problem."
"I like the case however, it fits loosely and the tablet is moving around alot...otherwise it's an excellent piece for the price.  I would recommend it  however, you should get the specifications correct.."
"I have been using this product for about three weeks, and couldn't be happier! I have been using it for about 4 weeks now, and the results have been amazing, I have lost inches around my waist and am getting closer to the flat tummy I have always wanted. I am a full time college student, but I make sure I make the time to get to the gym Monday through Friday! When I received my product there was a paper inside offering me a free bottle, and who doesn't love free stuff? I received a call from Maggie who asked me how the product was working, and encouraged me to call if I ever had any questions, as she said ""we are here to help you reach your goal"". A company that cares about the customers, and gives a free product gets my vote 100%!! With all that being said give naturewise a try.Thank you Naturewise, and Maggie for your encouraging words."
"Well what can I say. Its a dome. Water tight, nice, does what it should, protects! Its nice, well made......etc. Buy it."

"The costume was Great Quality it had a lot of room to wear clothes underneath to stay warm.  You could easily run and play and the costume did not tear.  The shipment was very fast, received it in 3 days with standard shipping!"
"Before ordering this online, I read some reviews saying it wasn't as strong as what they got in the store.  I wonder if they are comparing cologne they originally had to this product which is eau de toilette, a much lighter fragrance, which I prefer.  For me, this was a great deal."
"Fairly fast delivery. Very good price. Will try to buy from again in future.Most places were much higher. Just started using one of the batteriesso I can't comment on much else yet."

"By sharing this information, I am breaking the first and second rules of Fight Club. I heard somewhere that rules are made to be broken so here goes. It is an amazing book and has instantly become one of my favorites.  One of the most original stories I have ever read. I love how it allows you to dive into the mind of an split personality type and helps you realize that you are not your kindle, your car, or your XBOX. They did an excellent job adapting it into a motion picture so check out the movie if you haven't had the chance. I am Jack's satisfied mind."
"This fan was okay, it was nicely made and just as the colors show on line so they were when I received them. The price is a little pricey."
"This is such a cool Cd i got it to jam in the car and I like two songs thats the reason I bought it for well three songs. ""Hold on"" and ""break open the sky"" and ""tonight"". Very good sound!!!"
"very beautiful yes, but it was broken. I ordered from another vender and theirs were very good fans. They charged too much money for the fan and they were broken. Other venders charge much less and they have better products."
"Some dont close well. But you get what you pay for. They can do better than this material I think."
"This fan was very nicely made. IT was delicate and and beautiful and tightly built. Best fan to buy better than other fans!"
"The case is ok except for the slight smell coming from the case that I fear could be somewhat toxic."
"Nothing special here. It feels good in my hand, does the job it is intended for,  holds an edge well, and doesn't flex when you score wood."
"So I recieved the batman trilogy on blu-ray and I went to play the batman begins disc and it would not play. I tried it in a blu-ray player and my ps3 with firmware updates and got nothing. Not only does it not play but it shuts off and freezes the entire blu ray player, and on the ps3 you get to the home screen and there is no play button. Soooo disappointing !!!! even though I'm in the minority with this opinion I like batman begins as much as dark knight rises. So I say to what ever company is pumping these out without quality control, PLEASE STOP!!! it is not just me this has happened to 2 other people I know."
"love it for useful shoes and low price.BTW the logistic was very slow,i had to wait it for half month ,but it deserver ~~~~`"

"I'm seeing results immediately, making a different in arms abs and back. If you want something that works, here it is"
"When I got the engine, I did probably assembled it incorrectly, because it worked for 3 days only. I contacted Dorita at Jensen, and she told me to ship it to the for repairs. They repair my engine, sent it back to me UPS second day, and they did not charged me for the repair. Excellent and friendly customer service!"
"Fantastic watch! Sleek, well designed, goes great with all outfits. Water proof, very handy having the day and date on the watch.  I own a Nixon banks watch and I actually prefer the vestal in overall appearance!"
"They worked very well with my canon mp190. Don't waste your money with original ones. No error, no mismatching, good business."
"It's hard for me to believe this is Melinda R. Morgan's first book. The mixture of music, spirituality, romance, science, and the unknown are neatly connected for our reading pleasure. The pacing is nice. No action just for action's sake. The events unfold smoothly. It was satisfying in its own right, but left me wanting more."
"I have read over 60 zombie novels including zombie fallout, a new world, the remaining, and surviving the dead. I would have to say i enjoyed this one every bit as much as those. In fact in some ways more because this was not another series, it actually had and ending. I spent a long time scrolling thru ebooks looking for and new zombie read and honestly didn't expect much out of this book but was happy enough with it to write the first review i have ever done. As far as the mistakes or grammar problems, i was enjoying the story to much to really notice any. GREAT story cant wait for the next one."
"Great book.  Great continuation of maze runner.  Kept me interested and anxious the whole time.  Really connected with Thomas and what he was going through."
"Very good In-depth view of the history of currency wars and the making of currency world war 3.  Should be a book taught in schools to not just business majors but all students since it will affect everyone's future."
"Just what I needed for a great price! This is just what I needed for my canon recorder, the discs work perfectly and it has two rewriteable discs that I can use over and over!"
"At first I was a bit hesitant about buying this battery for my canon recorder, but I soon found out that it works great. When it is fully charged it lasts about two hours of recording."
"This game is a great time killer and is fun I love this game on my fire and I pod it has  levels you pay for but most are free! You should download this for at home and car rides. Everyone I know who has downloaded this has enjoyed playing and you will too"
"This book and the journal are great. Very inspiring and motivating. It's been a comfort and I really enjoyed reading it."
"It really does happen that children are abused this way. It did take me a who l e to read this because the details of what he suffered were hard to swallow but. It is something that society needs to have their eyes open to."
"Replaced my nonstick pans with this set.  So easy to use and clean.  Great for daily use.  Eggs won't stick.  Recently took the set camping and set the pans right in the fire.  Made eggs, sausage, burgers, hot dogs, and even boiled dinner (in the Dutch oven).  I will never use anything else."
"Excellent product deep corner pockets easy to wash/dry bought a different one for double the price that didn't fit as nicely.....great price excellent product"
"This definitely wakes up the engine. It does make a bit more power but what it really changes is the engine sound.  It's much louder and sounds mean. The intake is a bit pricey but its much better than getting just a filter."
"I like this romance book series.Read all three books and it was great to read over and over again."
"When I first read this book it really got me reading more and more.I couldn't get enough of the series."

"would have worked very well used in a winter wonderland themedit was a great accent would use  for other events arrived too late for intended event"
"It arrived too late, not very useful, unless you use two at a timenot some think i would recommend"
"does the job thoroughly. good for the price, in store this is a 30$ or more grinder. good buy, i like that the smart crusher logo is just a sticker and can removed very easily so you're left with a basic sleek grinder,"
"This is the only brace that does not slide around on my arm and allows me to comfortably play golf.  My tennis elbow is still healing and this  brace has helped me to be able to remain somewhat active while it does."
"The sizing was way off..... way way off... you will change or return Maybe give away like I had to do"
"I have only tried it for a few hours, and I'm really happy with this gave. Responds exellent on my Fire Hd. Great graphics and tutorials. Just open it, and the fun starts quick."
"The feel and fit of the case was good, except that the microphone opening is in the wrong side and covers the mic.  with the case on, nobody can hear you, and also; to make it worse; if some of you wonder what is that small hole on the top of the F7 phone? Well, that is a secondary microphone with a noise reduction system, and of course, the case covers that mic also. Since it was cheap, I just opened the holes for the microphones with scissors, and for some other supernatural reason, everybody that I tried to talk to told me that they could not hear me, after removing the case, they could hear me ok..."
"I love this app! I am younger so it helps me keep up with when I should be getting ready for it like taking pads to school!:)"

"no way to attach a canister of fuel from u.s.a. coleman portable tanks. Base size is different from u.s. size attachement"
"I looked at alot of reveiws and talked to freinds who bought this suit. Living in northeast Wisconsin I needed a suit that would keep me warm when fishing on the frozen tundra. The frabile icesuit is by far the best suit I ever owned. The construction was great and so was the fit. I would recommend this suit to any outdoor adventurer."
"Love these shoes they are exactly what I expected when I made the purchase! Was so happy when they were delivered! Thanks so much! = )"
"the fishes where not painted as detailed as portrayed,single bland colors,also two fishes where missing side fins and a few have nicked paint from shipping..i feel decieved"
"This app is really fun for long car rides and boring days. Some of the emojis don't make much sense but all in all its a really fun game."
"I only read the sample but I definitely will be boring the full version! This is on of the best vampirebooks I've ever read, much better than twilight in my opinion."
"Just love it, nice color (bougt it in dark blue) and good quality. It may a little large for the size, but it feels and looks good."
"I thought this book was wonderful!! Very well thought out, exciting, romantic, and full of fun! I was glad to see a lot more of Devereux in this book as he is my favorite character!! I just couldn't put it down once I started reading it! I read it in under a day!!"
"This short story was cute and funny! It doesn't have anything to do with Devereux so if you are expecting that then you will be disappointed. If you really love this series like I do then you should definately read this shorty story as well. Just don't try to read this without reading the other books that came before it or you will definatley not get it. I recommend reading them all for sure!"
"Collection of stories and historical perspective from the beginnings at West Point.Good conversation starter.Wish there was an iBooks version to accompany the Print version"
"Our favorite baby toy!"
"Looks great!"
"Best part of my week was reading this book! Let's just say I love NAZ, the good.. the bad, I'll take him how ever I can get him."
"This is the best baby item I have had. 6 years ago , I got it as a gift. I loved it so much that when I had another baby 5 years later, I got another one with different color. Depending how big your baby is , it could last you till year and half .  It is easy to move it from room to room. 5 stars all the way!!!"
"This is one of my most favorite diet products I've used. I saw the Dr. Oz show replay talking about green coffee bean extract and came here on Amazon to try this one out (looked like a great deal). I'm glad I did. I'm getting great results and am about to order another bottle."
"As always top rated"
"Definitely helped me plan our wedding! Quick and easy to figure out. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is finding it stressful planning their wedding"
"This product was very well made and will last forever but it just doesn't work as a belt clip.Damages dress belts with minimum useNot secure on wide beltsScreen faces out so it is exposed to possible damage and nosy peopleI am very impressed with all the other products from this company but they need to put more through into a belt clip design."
"they came on time and I got 107! there where a couple of repeats and a few broke but good for the price! I love love them and will be ordering from them again"
"I started using this product about 8 months ago and have been very pleased. I am very sensitive to other shampoos including very high end products. After using CLEAR I shortly noticed a significant improvement in the health of my scalp and hair. My hair is naturally wavy and requires additional products to keep the frizz down. With CLEAR Frizz control I don't need to use additional products and it takes less time to get ready in the morning.I have referred this product to many people and now my sister and her family and brother and his family are using this. They are all very satisfied.Highly recommended. Your hair will look amazing in less than a week."

"Works good.  I was able to hear conversation and it lessened the noise from semi auto hand gun noise.  I have not used it with rifle yet."
"as advertised.  took awhile to come.  It does help with suction on my vacume cleaner.  I used the two large filters and just washed my small one"
"thought there would be more of a color assortment. to many of the same dull colors. men they were bought for were not impressed."
"Had a similar one with different style material and it snagged terribly. This one fits and feels wonderful and have no issue with snagging."
"Well made and just the right weight. Not to heavy not to light. Have seen similar design but this one had the best price. Very pleased."
"Shoe is true to size. It was a perfect fit. It is very light weight. Best shoe I have ever purchased for walking."
"This keyboard is a great buy.  It is lightweight and the spacing of the keys make it comfortable to type on.  I initially had a problem getting it to connect to my iPad, then I realized I was not doing it correctly.  It works great and I would recommend it to anyone."
"My case looks great. It came ahead of time. Ive gotten quite a few compliments from it. The only problem is the hole for the ear phones is too small other then that i love the case."
"This book helped me understand what Celiac Disease really is and what you can do to control it. It explains what the disease will do to you if you don't take control and make the necessary changes in your life,"
"Dev Shannon is a good bad boy.  He is smart as whip and equally creative in getting the job done.  Personally charming with a dash of redneck.  I like the descriptions of everywhere he went in pursuit of his jobs. You feel like you could go to the city he is describing and walk right into the bar he is sitting in.  I highly recommend this book if you want an adventure that you will not be able to predict what is going to happen or how he is going to get the job done. I enjoyed the writing style used in this book, it is always a step ahead"
"It's been a great buy for us. The wholes are on the smaller side that's why I gave it a 4 star but overall it's a very handy tool to have in the kitchen. After cleaning the peppers with corer I fill the pan with peppers then the peppers with a piping bag. Quick and easy."
"This thing is awesome! How did I ever get along without it?! It makes popper making so quick and easy! Love it!"
"The description read &amp;#34;Thick Cushioned Gel-Backing for Extra Comfort&amp;#34; that's a bold lie; it's paper thin! And what gel?! I only purchased this item becuase of the promise to be thick and cushioned; I might as well just put my child on the hard floor."
"We like the product becuase of its ingrediants, it doesn't have a lot of the additives the other brands have. They do take a little longer to dissolve than hylands other tablets so keep that in mind. Otherwise great product."
"I had to order more of these cups because they are everyone's favorites to use! They hold 16oz, great for big coffee/tea drinkers like us."
"It was just as awesome and heartwarming as expected! I waited 1 month but it was definitly worth the wait!"
"small and pricey. returned it. found the same one at much cheaper price at target and walmart. did not buy it as i had many options."
"Great box Exactly what i needed. it isnt water proof but its definitely seems like shock proof. Great way to protect the camera"
"This read captures you from the first chapter. You have to know what could lead anyone to such mental instability. You feel for the unfortunate and really feel like you are working the case. It makes you think."

"The terminals were bent or broken on both batteries when received. I do not believe this was caused in shipping"
"I keep these units in my bag, car etc... Great backups to have on hand  They fit perfectly into life case and are of good quality"
"This product is excellent.  The size is very compact and doesn't seem like it's larger than it needs to be.  I recently updated my TV from a LG 32in LCD to a LG 42in LED.  My PX21's were connected to the older TV via 3.5mm.  However, the newer TV was missing the 3.5mm port.  Connected an optical cable from my 360 slim to the FiiO, and the PX21's 3.5mm connector into the &amp;#34;line out&amp;#34; port on the FiiO.  On the 360, make sure the audio is set to &amp;#34;Stereo&amp;#34; because any of the &amp;#34;Surround Sound&amp;#34; setting will not output audio to the headphones. I believe if you connect the device to the TV, you change the audio settings on your TV to &amp;#34;PCM&amp;#34;.  I am very satisfied with this product."
"Case arrived damaged.  Pieces of the red paint were chipped and very noticeable BEFORE removing the plastic.  The screen protector was nothing to write home about, and I never planned on using the stylus.  Returned the next day and received a full refund.  My disappointment was short-lived as I also ordered the SPIGEN Neo Hybrid case in red alongside this case."
"I got this for one of my close college friends for her birthday and she loved it! We were able to sit down one day and have a civil conversation about how to raise unicorn farms."
"Very comfortable and fit perfectly. Most of all animal friendly!"
"This touching, funny book has superb insights into the bodily senses, politics, marriage, academia, and regional subcultures, among many other things.Underneath the funny barbs, this is a loving tribute to Oregon's special mixture of East and West coasters, environmentalists and anarchists, do-gooders and cynics. And mixed in with the hilarious spoofs of college professors, there are wonderful meditations on what it means to get the insider's point of view. The particular focus is a young politics professor's attempt to get inside the minds of local anarchists, but the insights into this vexed enterprise apply to much of the contemporary world: the vicissitudes of sudden mass movements, celebrities, and scandals, the frantic drive in the mass media and on the internet to uncover everyone's secrets.But of course all this works only because the writing is so good--gorgeous descriptions, attention to sensual details, beautifully evoked scenes and characters. So I'll just end by listing, somewhat at random, a few short examples:...""[He was] divorced for the flair with which he shined his shoes.""Joey (mother to son): ""I hope Oregon isn't like Israel.""Sequoia: ""through the body we reach the spirit, heart, and mind, not the other way around.""In short, there's a lot going on here!"
"This little power pack charged my phone from 45% battery to 100% within roughly 20 minutes.  Since I did not utilize the entire charge ability in one shot, it has plenty of power left before I will need to charge it again.  Great charger. Of all the various chargers I've researched, this one received the best reviews, and I totally agree with them."
"Good sound. Too many wires. Gets a lil confusing to set up and they get in the way. Spend the extra $ and get a wireless set"
"Just what I was looking for.  Had a railroad watch many years ago.  When I needed a new watch, I started looking for a new model.  Although a little hard to find, this model is perfect.  Good size, not too big, light weight, easy to read.I did follow other users tip to fully charge the watch prior to use, it's working great.The Amazon purchase process was also easy and good, delivered right on time."
"I loved reading the seeing the story unfold through Hudson's eyes. I couldn't put it down. It's definitely on my &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; list."
"The game has great graphics,and easy to use controls. This game is a must buy. I think this is one of my favorite games ever"
"This is a great product. I needed to mount a hot-shoe mount style shockmount from a boompole, with some flexibility, and this product fit the bill perfectly. Very sturdy."
"Is case for the Galaxy Sll ever going to be mailed to me or do I need to send more money???"

"I just got my eaarphone last week. I reallly liked the sound quality of it. The best thing about it is its microphone, the voice quality is really good. This is the only reason I changed my old headphones. Now I'm more than happy.Thanks."
"One of the screws of the mounting stand was broken. The gooseneck is too hard to bend.  I would not like it even if it was not broken as its too hard to adjust or bend the gooseneck.Go for it if you want a sturdy stand. But if you are looking for something which is soft to bend then this might disappoint you.Hope this helps you to make a decision.Thanks,kk"
"I really thought it would be a nice tote bage.  It was nothing more than a cheap plastic bag that broke the first time my granddaughter used it.  Don't buy it!!!!!!"
"I love this product, I used to to sew on a jacket of mine. That way I kinda look like Tron, the only thing is that the light is more blueish than green, but I like it that way. Green when off, blue when on!Edit, just FYI it is not water proof, learned that the hard way :("
"We are warned not to judge a book by its cover, but in this case we get an accurate taste of things to come when we see the hooded hunter and the anxious yet calculating expression of the hunted.However, the cover must leave out a good deal, like the strange death of her father on his farm in Sheparton, the finding of a possible ally and lover, and the help that comes from an unlikely source.In rating a book by the difficulty of putting it down and by the quality of its prose, I give Play or Die five stars on each. The pace of the action, the ingenuity of the pursued and the glimpse of life in a post-apocalyptic world are blended to into a believable whole. Jo flees and misleads her Hunter while contriving to find opportunities for sleep in those three-hour periods of grace when her co-ordinates are not being broadcast. She has to survive for five days."
"I'm 5'10"" 174 curvy and I have a big butt and thighs. Brought a small/medium the only problem is my butt hangs out the bottom. I have spanks so it won't be a problem but if you're tall like me and have curves do the bigger size. But if you have a small waist do the small/medium. The material is nice as far as costumes go. Its soft, stretchy material. I also brought the leg avenue crop gloves, very nice and the whip thats in the pic. Love it tho!"
"Very interesting.. An historic and present view of world megatrends with focus on their geographical position and potential conflictsI have not finished reading.."
"i guess i should have read a little more on the description, but this kit looked like it had alot of cutting wheels and such, but really only has a few. the main item it has is sanding bits....i don't own a nail salon so i definitely don't need 50 sanding bits. but if that's what you're looking for then i would recommend this kit"
"It's a plastic box.... That holds batteries. Cant Go wrong there! May even end up buying some more! Cleans up the junk drawer pretty well"

"I wish I had ordered this scrub top sooner in my pregnancy! It's so soft and comfortable! I definitely recommended buying this top!"
"I honestly love this bouncer, my feet can tell you otherwise... It definetly will not flop over because of the wide base. I've tripped many times with the base of it since it really sticks out. Other than some jammed toes, my daughter really seems to enjoy it, I would recommend buying! It's easy to assemble and the material can be quickly removed for a wash."
"good.. but  my daughter hates it. T^TI didn't know what to do&amp;#12619;&amp;#12619; &amp;#12622;&amp;#12622; &amp;#12636;&amp;#12636;Thank you very much."
"This was bought for a grandson. It really works, and shoots the rocket up very high. It needs to be played away from buildings and trees, for obvious reasons."

"This is just like playing the real game. You have to roll, choose what you want, wait for the other player to take their turn. I love it."
"This game is played just like the real game of dominos, unlike some digital copies that change things to make it easier. I like that."
"My three year old is addicted to this game. He loves it and plays every chance he gets. I don't like the blood, considering his age, but apparently it's not to hard. Though he has spent a few hours on one level."
"Don't water your time and money on this POS. Average lifespan in these heater seem to be 2 weeks to 3 months. I bought two of the 300w for my breeding rack and one has already quit altogether and the other other is about 15 degrees off. I will never buy anything from AquaTop again. Junk products from a junk company."

"I think this is a solid watch.  I have bought a few watches in the past few years to diversify my business wear, and this watch is by far my favorite for any black band or gold watch that I have.  The blue accents the gold real well and it wears nicely.  It is certainly a conversation piece."
"This book is a must read. It is just perfect! My first book by this author and she didn't disappoint."
"I bought this so we wouldn't keep breaking our Corelle dinner plates. We usually make our bacon in the microwave, it's a lot faster and easier. I use paper towels with this, two on the bottom and one on top, just like I always do. I like it but I don't think it does anything special. It is very easy to clean, with the paper towels it hardly even gets greasy. I will use it for a few months and update again."
"I bought two of these and I love them! I bake meatloaf and bread and basically everything I can think of in these pans. I make supper for two people so these are the perfect size. And I can wash them with my dishrag and don't have to scrub and scrub to get them clean. Defiantly nonstick and I will be buying more of Faberware Bakeware. Just love it."
"I received this razor for free from Gillette, it was such a nice surprise. This razor has five extra thin blades. I have to shave in the evenings otherwise my face and head get razor burns and such, I tried to shave in the morning with this razor too, but I still got razor burns. So if you are a morning shaver it might not work that well for you, but I highly recommend you try it for yourself. It is a five star razor for me!! I am officially going to use Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual razors! I shave my entire head and face every other day and the blades last me for a month or so. Overall great razor this is a must try."
"Great baking cups, but they bleed. After I baked my cupcakes there was hardly any pink left on them, but lucky me, there was some on my new cupcake pan. I will not be buying them again."

"Bought this for my girl for Halloween and it fit just like the picture advertised. The wet look material looked really hot and the way the suit stretched to match her curvy body was amazing. I was hoping these suits were legit and not some cheap polyester but they were nice and stretchy so the spandex was perfect. My wife is 5'4 and 125 lbs with D cups so the small was HOT on her!"

"I initially bought the retail airfloss from amazon but it winded up dying on me after 2 weeks so I called sonicare and they said the dental pro model is better and more durable. I got this pro model and I have had it for over 3 months now and it works great. The water shoots out strait and with good force to clean those hard to reach places. Love the Oraltonin rinse as well."

Well it won't work for me.because I love the Lord.an also I was looking at it for all the wrong reasons.I am so glad that the Lord has worked with me to look for knowledge an prayer before I do anything. THANK U:)"
"It's a great book, easy to read an understand.since it is downloaded on my kindle,I can refer back to it easily. We will be getting a Maltichon pup early summer.So we r getting a lot of preparation done before she arrives.This book was a great start."

"Great movie. I bought it for a friend, but was able to watch it and enjoyed it. It was enjoyable and funny."
"My wife bought this for our first born. It's magical. The vocals are amazing, the songs are beautifully arranged, the lyrics are sweet and the melodies are wonderful. We put it on every night for the little one and I can't recommend it enough."
"My wife and I both agreed that the best actor in this film was the dog. Having said that, he was an exceptionally gifted dog actor, so it's swings and roundabouts.Plus points: The action sequences are brilliant. Really good, and have much better pacing than in the book where they are somewhat ponderous and muddy in the detail. Also, some of the more laborious bits of the book are left out, so when it does eventually get going (after about the first 70 minutes), it's pretty good.Minus points: The lead guy is a muchness. The lead guy's dad/guardian is cold and unlikeable, pretty much binning the character from the book. The woman playing number six has something of a ""Mid-Pacific"" accent, veering between Australia and the US on a sentence-to-sentence carousel of linguistic wonderment. The whole of the first hour is pretty dull. I was going to say terrifyingly dull, but that romanticises it somewhat - it's just dull.But there is enough going on to keep you interested. Don't read the book first though - I guarantee you'll be disappointed."
"These card sleeves are awesome! They are perfect for any duelist needing sleeves for their deck. I love Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon and wanted to have these as soon as i saw them. These are definitely a must look at and great buy!"

"Consumer Repots recommended this as &amp;#34;the &amp;#34;toaster to use.  It is great! One can set the numerical dial and get the right amount of browning."
"There were many inconsistencies and impossibilities in this movie. And the alien looked like a bad Halloween costume. If the alien is sort of the main focus it should at least be done well. I would never watch this again. Waste of time."
"I usually dont write reviews, but this book was just that good! It kept my attention the entire time and I finished this book in one sitting because I could not put it down. Great book and cant wait for the next in the series!"
"This saves hundreds of dollars on monthly cable bills, I totally recommed this purchase especially if you have college kids!"
"smoking hot and a great read."
"As of right now the game quality for the PC is terrible. When you can actually get the game to run and finish a game (which is very rarely), the game play is fun and graphics are great but out of the 10 games I played last night I only finished two. The rest of the games ended with generic ""something went wrong"" messages. I am very disappointed in the quality and I am frankly tired of game producers rushing their release dates for shoddy game play. However as I speak new patches are coming in everyday to better the server issues, and as I mentioned before the game, when functional, is fun and worth the $60.00. What you would be getting at this point in time isn't worth $20.00. My advice would be to wait for Black Friday and get a better price and hopefully by then, a better product following all the up coming patches. Really wish I would have waited instead of pre-ordering."
"Bought this item for use when running, Velcro sticks well as have bought one before and it came undone as running but this one is good. Good size for my arms which are not skinny (but not fat either), fits tight around phone so good for listening to music as running. In general, this is a good product, which worths for money."
"The boots are absolutely beautiful.  I bought a size 8M (my true size), and the zipper wouldn't go up all the way....I have other boots no problem....thought ok, I'll try an 8W  still no luck, this is definitely for a SMALL calf....boohoo..."
"I really liked the zipper on the side and the velcro on the other. I have bad hips so bending over to try and get my feet into other boots is hard. But with these i can just slip in the side and with a quick zip be ready to go. I would highly reccomend to anybody whos not very flexible or has joint problems because of how easy they are to put on and take off,"
"I was kind of disappointed with this card stock.  It is not as smooth as the Neenah Super Smooth White card stock and you can't blend alcohol markers as well, but it works just fine for digi stamps using colored pencils."
"Product came in a box, well wrapped up. 2 of the heads for body provided were a bit rusty.otherwise the machine works fine n the suction so far is pretty decent. Wish they supplied more cotton pads. I used it twice a wk, each time my face feels smooth after. Especially helpful for the oil seeds under eyes."
"I loved this book.  I see it as a true love story.  It made me believe that good men and people exist. This give the message that you are never really alone. I will recommend to my book club as book of the month. Congras  and a very good read."
"I like this shirt- however I was expecting a lighter weight material (probably my own fault for not reading the description throughly though!) This is a medium weight cotton material.I really like it though- the fit is loose and the quality is excellent. Just to note the pink logo- writing is shimmery! Again not what I was expecting, but I like it! Under Armour is always a great choice"
"Was for my son. He said it was fine and easy to understand. Great for an introduction to trumpet. Now he needs to practice"
"Perfect height as well. I have no worries of my keyboard falling. Did not come with instructions but I figured it out."
"This was a pretty good side-present for Christmas. My friend had been wanting one for a while so I got him one."
"If the SF series we watch these days would leave this much for the audience to wonder, not to tell them everything that will happen in the cliche storyline in the pilot already, then I would say the good science-fiction is what we watch. &amp;#34;After&amp;#34; does just that, leave parts of the plot to the viewer and in the same time makes the show much more suspenseful and much more interesting than it would be if the same old cliche storyline is served over and over again.Acting in the first half of the pilot is great, further in the pilot some things are slightly illogical, (they all born on the same date ended on the same parking lot?) but in general this is very good pilot which by atmosphere reminds on the first (and so far the best) season of &amp;#34;Walking dead&amp;#34;. I would really like for the series to continue so that we can see what's hidden and what is that screenwriters left for us to discover.Recommend to all, but mostly to CW and SyFy screenwriters, because this is how you make an SF series and not that corn stuff we watch on those networks."
"I was looking for trash cans under each desk in an office and this was the perfect one!Its pretty small so fills up pretty fast but serves well the purpose"
"It doesn't. Work  do not buy this company is liar.warning don't buy products Tom this company  I repeat do not buy"
"Cool awesome story loving great fondness for the others were not the only one that could help them with their own way to get out of the problems in this story"

"I LOVE THIS MOVIE so i love this case these little guys are awesome ! to beyond ! for me"
"These earbuds look pretty awesome, but the sound quality kinda sucks the mic also sucks I compared them to like $11 green headphone from Marshall's and there was a substantial difference! Save up and buy better ones"
"If I have to pay for it, it should be the whole book, not bits and pieces of the book."
"The estimated arrival date was a couple weeks out but it came early took about a week..Very easy install and looks and feels great.Good product great price worth the wait."
"Highly recommend this book for anyone who is a part of a foster child's life as it is a confusing time in their life. This book really breaks it down from each adults/professionals' roles in their life, to their own confusing feelings that they may be experiencing."
"I got this and loved it .Just right for taking with any time.The price is good I am getting more and the quality is good too."
"I bought this rug to place under my coffee table in the living room. The colors are nice, and looks great with my wooden sofa set. Great Buy !!!Tim C."

"Very easy to use and wash up great. Would buy this again and recommend them to my friends. very happy with them."
"The quality of product was really bad but I guess that's what you get for a cheap knife. I would never buy this product again."
"I really enjoyed this book. It was very full and answered a lot of my questions about yellow fangs past. May be the best book yet.Sincerely,Leapordstar of Stormclan"
"I am a huge warriors fan and have read almost every book. i really thought it would be longer. still, a good book, and erin hunter has failed to dissapoint me yet again. Sincerely, Leapordstar, leader of Stormclan"
"The case is very cute and stylish. I would prefer that the entire case were hard, but oh well. For the price- I'm happy!"
"Very surprised how well made it is. My son loves sleeping on it. He even uses it for his friends sleep overs."
"awsome is a good game great way to pass the time I'm just doing this to get more oil on the game"
"Wore it at casino every night for 4 days.  Got no response from women at all.  Would not recommend this product."
"It is hard to concentrate on only one part of the story, your head cannot stop at one line but explodes into many storylines. Great book, wonderful writer"
"My daughter loved them as soon as she saw them, then she loved them more when she put them on. They are soft and incredibly warm. They come with an extra pait of laces (grey) to combine. Good price as well."
"I was in doubt as to the size but it fits perfect. I am 1,58m and it gets down right at my knees. It feels warm and light at the same time, good cut, it doesn't make me feel like a bear, it makes a nice shape. Wide enough sleeves for you to move freely. I love it"
"I always wear medium but I bought this one in Large and it just fits. Great colour to wear in spreing or summer. Love it"
"I love knitted clothing and this cardigan is amazing, it looks great, it is original, and fits wonderfully. The colour goes with lots of matching things, blue jeans or light blue ones, very nice with orange tee below. Good quality!!!"
"I didn`t realize it has 3/4 sleeves but it fits fine, it looks heavier in the picture than what it really is. I like it"
"I haven't washed it yet but the fabric looks like those which get smaller looks better than feels, the fabric looks cheap."
"I was in doubt about the size and fit, I bought it for my mother who is shorter than the model and it fits wonderfully! She loved it. It goes down just a bit below her knee. The fabric is soft and light."
"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. .. she loved it... Great product..will buy from again... 5 &amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;!!! Highly recommended product!!!"
"When the Uggs arrived, the fabric was REALLY fuzzy and looked like they had been worn for years on the fabric, although I know they weren't because the sole was new."
"the earphone is suck!!! not louder at all!!! but the bass is okay for the price and i am not okay with this earphone..."
"is good. cheap and cut out of the screen protectors is nice and it fit just right and i like it!!!!"

"I've not received the product yet. It doesn't even have a tracking number so I can know where is at. I'm worried!"
"The pieces fit very well however the artwork does not. I guess I should have expected this from a small globe. In any case, it was fun fixing it up. Thanks!"
"I have been using the keyboard for about 3 months. It has been as sturdy as the first time. Typing on the ipad mini is now so much better! One dislike is the fact that the keyboard does not work when we have to log in to a wifi network at a hotel. When a pop up screen appears for me to key in the passcode, I cannot seem to type uding the ZAGG. I have to open a document, type in what I need to, then copy and paste it on the pop up screen. Another issue is that the play or pause buttons cannot be used on spotify.Otherwise, I think its a great typing tool to have. Thanks!"
"The dress is of good quality. We like it very much. Good thing my daughter is 10months and small so she can use it now. Despite the size issues, its a great deal! Thanks"

"This book started slowly but I  couldn't put it down for the last couple or three chapters. I was not too surprised by the end though."
"Cherie Priest has mastered that fine line between vernacular wit and sophomoric daily diary sort of stuff.  In other words, she writes the way people talk, but not only that, she writes the way SMART people talk, and manages not to write any of the stuff you're going to want to skip.  I was a fan from the first page I read (which was in her first book in this series, ""Bloodshot""), and hope this turns out to be a long series."
"It's pretty good, I haven't read the newest book in the series though. I have been playing video games more than reading but this was a pretty good buy."
"Never finished the book, when I bought it I thought it was the next book in the series. I only got half way through, and I was very bored when reading it. I guess it was my bad for buying it under false pretenses."
"This was a free buy, Tim Mettey came to my school to sell this product, I looked it up on amazon and it was free. I haven't read it yet, but I am sure its a great book for being free."

"Didn't like. Only for children. Kinda boring. Trailer makes you think it would be better... I wouldn't watch this movie again"
"I love this moisturizer. I've been using it for 1,5 months I can say and it makes my skin feel and look amazing. So far I love all the Mama Mio products. The ones I tried so far, Clean Slate, Eye Know and this one, all have Aloe Vera as the first ingredient. No wonder these products feel so good!"
"I really like this handle and how it allows the razor to move.Every other handle i've used had razors built in which never allowed it to move with my face.I'm able to get a great grip so I can make sure I have total control which means less cuts.I'd like to say I was lucky enough to try this for free thanks to a program from Gillette."
"I ordered a size bigger then I am and they barely fit past my knees! They are about 5 sizes smaller then they claim. They also smelled horrible when I pulled them out of the package. It's a nasty chemical smell. I will be sending them back."
"Really enjoyed this read! Marta Perry always writes great books. I read them out of order and it wasn't confusing. Loved the book would recommend."
"whenever I paint my nails I put this on as a top coat, and in about 10 minutes my nails are perfectly dry. I love that they become really solid, because I hate walking around trying not to touch anything in fear of messing my nails up. the one thing I will say is it does make my nail polish peel, it wont chip, but if you get nervous and play with your nails, I wouldn't recommend this for you."
"I heard this album a few times on youtube.com, and decided to purchase it --- albeit used, but for my collection. The reason for doing so is actually a couple tracks, such as Where be Mosada, a sad and dreamy rendition leaning towares hopeful chords - filled with (amazingly perfect!) tremolo use.  I like the up beat Oui Oui Si Si track too."
"This album is sure to become a future classic.  It's full of excellent guitar work from both, with Lee being more on the correct jazz box side of thing and Larry being more of a jazz / rock musician.  I heard this album on youtube, and had to own it."

"Love it!"
"HAD to buy Shadow Pass. I read library copies of Eastland's other two Pikkala novels. but the library didn't have Shadow Pass.  It was just as good as Eye of the Red Tsar and Archive 17."

Edith's marriage has failed and she once again moves into a close relationship with Ambrose, her 'nancy-boy'..Frank Moorhouse's intensive research into the history of this period has resulted in a fascinating insight into the influential characters in the League, the reasons for it's failure and the impact of the rise of Nazi Germany on the bohemian and artistic population of Geneva.The story concludes on a despondent note with the failure of the surviving delegates of the League to be admitted to the conference in San Fransisco of the newly formed United Nations, and their feeling that their work was to no avail."
"They are a very great sound for the price I was really surprised but I am very happy with the outcome"
"The poker games are fun but very addictive game  that is very tough to beat the computer on any hand you win and try to double your small prize  ..... it will beat you 19 times out of 20 and you will lose all you just worked so hard to gain.

"i really did not want to spend a lot of money for mobile speaker.i love this speaker. the sound is not the same when using Bluetooth. At home i always connect him on my audio cable to my device."
"Axe works great.  The saw is sharp but the angle of the handle is similar to a cooking knife, so you get tired if you need to cut a few pieces greater 6&amp;#34; would work a little better handle and blade were slightly angled."
"I am pleased with the brew, but not enthused.  I have had better for the price, but its ok. Thats it"
"Impressed with the price and taste of this coffee.  I also like the lower price compared with the competition. Winner!"
"I love the packaging and brew of this coffee.  Yes works great in the Keurig.  I like the organic brew.  Certainly taste the difference!"
"I really like this coffee.  It has a very unique taste ,and comes in a heavy box,which I like how it is dispensed."
"Its ok, not much of a choc kinda freak. Not my cup of tea really.  Might be asking the wrong person."
"because it is a very good book.there is nothing to dislike.yes i have already recommened it to several pepole"
"works great. easy to install.yes i would recommend this product. have no complants about this product.i choose this product because of the rating."

"I love my dice. They look awesome in my new car. They came quick inthe mail. They were wrapped nicely as well."
"Good dvd that shows in the life of a 40 year old Elton. Not about music really just life on the Made in England tour. Decent if you're a fan."
"I really liked the neckalce, but you could not read the writing on the heart. I had to find a magnifying glass on christmas just to read it to my mom. Other than that it was a nice."
"I really liked the 3-d wooden puzzle, twin towers. It was a perfect gift for my husband on christmas. I have a lot of these puzzles."
"They work on my car because my Rouge is silver so it blends. But since it only sticks on the front and can see the original color right behind it. It is overpriced but the cheapest i found."
"I bought as a gift and husband wears everyday and sprays several squirts and it doesn't smell like other colognes. Doesn't stick and almost a waste."
"So in the picture i saw a nice size detailed metal puzzle. Eager to try since I enjoy 3d wood puzzles, i ordered it. Well to my disappointment I got in the mail a small square about 4 inches around. And to add more disappointment when I built it it was smaller than the palm of my hand. For the price it should of been much much larger. Don't be fooled. It's only worth $5.00.Update 4/15/2013I have bought and completed 13 of these MODELS from A.C. Moore for $5.99 a piece, so i stand by my comment that thiss one is overpriced. It was still fun to build just like all the others from the maker of this brand.Just be warned, They are small."
"However, I only got it in March and the AC  adapgter has since stopped working, I need a replacement one. My 15 year old is driving me nuts without it."
"My 14 year old daughter and 3 year old son will sit down and play this game for 45 minutes each!!"

"The Billionaire Bachelors series were books that made you believe in love romance and passion these books were also let you know there was so much more to these men I loved that their father let them know they had to work hard for what they got and the story of Katherine and Joseph really brought it all  together"
"loving this game cant wait to unlock more rooms i didnt think it would be so much fun i would recomend it to friends keep up the good worka"
"So far, the other reviews are dead on. I played music first and wasnt extremely impressed. Put in avator'' the cat trying to kill him scene''and wow! You can feel the tree's cracking and the gun shots...what! The speakers put you there. I'm hard to please and i feel for ''out of the box'', this is a great speaker. I'm sure they will get better after the break-in period."
"I havent had a cerwin vega since the 80's. I read these reviews and took a chance. There isnt many reviews out there so i feel obligated to share. Im a klipsch fan and the xls compare very well. I have the xls 6c and the xls 28's. The 6c was great and brought alot to the over all sound of my system. Very clean and dynamic. Dont wait! High end speakers is what this is for a great price. Not the smallest thing sitting under your flat screen, but well worth it. Im a CV fan once again!"
"I just received this case in the mail today. I ordered it monday and got it by Thursday and it had to ship from california to maine. The feeling of the case is very sturdy. It is a well build case and feels great in the hand. This case is great if you looking to prevent your phone from scratches and are looking for a stylish case but with minimal protect to show off the beauty of your iphone. The back of the case is see through so you can see the apple logo. It is not white on the back as the picture shows. The devise when faced downwards on a smooth surface does not touch the surface but it would be a good idea to get a screen protector as there is very little room from the case to the screen. The only reason i gave it 4/5 is because i feel the case is a little over priced and the picture does show a white backing. I purchased it for $15 dollars when i feel it should have been more like $10 but still definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a good case with minimal protection."
"I LOVE my weight lifting gloves: they really have a grip. Everyone @ the gym ask me we're did I get them from....Also LOVE the color&amp;#128517;"
"I ordered this hitch and received a oil filter for a 9N tractor, They made it easy to return to them"
"I love this purse! Really big ,but now i love it. I use this when ever I'm going out somewhere nice!"
"This case was good for at least a month before the accessories had begun to fall off! Cheap. Cheap. Cheap"
"My little nephew is SO happy with this book! The quality of this book was used so I was worried about the pop-ups being damaged but nope, all still in tact. This series of books is near and dear to my heart and I wanted to start sharing it with my nephew now (who is only 9 months old) but LOVES when someone reads to him. So happy with this item."
"Worked perfectly for the look that I was going for. It's a sheer curtain, um, that's white. What else do you want me to say, Amazon??"
"This is EXACTLY what I have been searching for for my Vita! I wanted something not so bulky but would protect from the items in my purse or bag. Will not protect against falls but they make cases for that. Love it!"
"I was a little disappointed in the quality of this tulle. I'm using it to make a 38 inch bustle on a tutu and it frayed on the ends and curled and got very weird looking. It does not match the straightness of the red tulle I have on the tutu so I'm going to have to go back, throw all the black tulle away, and buy a better quality tulle. Not happy at all, since I paid about $18 total for this material and I'm just having to throw it away and redo all my work. What a waste of my money."
"I loved this case, it just looks nice and clean and well put together. It's not bulky and keeps your phone nice and thin, not slippery. Cut out openings are very precise, didn't have any trouble getting my S-pen out or using the camera. I was so heartbroken when I had to give it away, though. I have a Zagg screen protector on my Note II and after having this case on my phone for about 30 minutes my Zagg started lifting and bubbling on one corner. The inside of the case is a little too sharp to have a screen protector. I still blame the Zagg though, I feel it doesn't sit well on the screen (it extends to the edges too much). I really loved this case but, because the Zagg was a $30 purchase, I had to go with another case. If you don't have a screen protector that doesn't extend too far to the edges of your screen then you should be fine. I'm just sad I couldn't use it."
"I ordered this and a got some Chinese finger puppet thing I would recommend getting one from the store and it is cheaper because you don't have to pay shipping"
"This book is terrifying and captivating and brilliant. I could not put it down. It made me hateful and angry and opened my eyes in a way that I cannot come back from. My entire understanding of myself and the world changed with this read. It is not for the faint of heart. If you are a feminist or believe in women or at the very least have any concept of human decency this will affect you. It affected me. I finished the book, looked up, and whole heartedly felt baffled by the fact that the world around me had not changed when I had changed so much. I highly recommend. It is a very unique look at very heavy subject matter."
"this product way passed my expectations and was well worth the wait it is made out of a nice durable material and is well worth your money"
"I enjoyed this book ..... A little sudden ending but over all a good read. I suggest silver ties as well by this author really great read and man some HOT bdsm in it !"
"If u liked fifty shades and brie's submissive training center you will love getting in on the world of DOMZ.com in this series. The story line is heart felt and the scene's are hot !"
"This book is one of my least favorites in this series so far. I love that it continues to fallow the other couples as there stories continue to unfold, however I felt as though this book was to short. There is getting to be detail after detail in the story lines of the numerous couples that needs to be told, i felt as tho grit and his masters story didn't get the details it deserves. I am not sure if that was due to moving things along or trying to shorten thing so the book didn't get to long ? I personal would have preferred the extra pages and details. I was just getting into grit and his master's story when this book came to an end, I am ready for stix to release to see what happens next!"
"I have read all of the holland brothers and this is my favorite one yet. I love that this one is a love that stands the test of time. Well done Toni, next on my list is &amp;#34; Finding Conner &amp;#34;."
"I bought this as a gift for my husband and it came exactly as pictured and it came right on time for his birthday.  The clasp has broken since I bought it 2 months ago, but it was an easy fix and is still wearable."
"this app was very challenging yet interesting wjen my friends and i partook in playing this app. i love this app"
"This book was just what I needed. It really is amazing how changing your thinking just a little can shift your view on so many issues and bring you more peace. As a mother of two young kids I appreciated how easy it was to read and complete the exercises daily!"
"My daughter loves these undies; they are really cute and are good quality. I'm happy."
"This book had me on my toes the entire time.. I couldn't stop reading it! River was just a dream, his songs, his everything is just wow... He was so sweet and understanding with Dahlia. This book is a MUST READ. I cried, I laughed, I smiled.. That cliff hanger left me wanting more so I went and got Torn right away. Thank You Kim!!"
"This book picked up right where River and Dahl left off. And another person who had been MIA... It started with a bang! River fought for Dahl with his beautiful lyrics and amazing ways. He truly loves her. The little twists and turns made it so much better! Very amazing read! &amp;#10084;&amp;#65039; River is perfect.. Really."
"I'M STILL KIND OF IN SHOCK.Let me start off my saying this is not your typical story, it isn't a fairytale. I was a bit ify about this read at first, I'm not going to lie. BUT that quickly changed! I was sucked into Lilian's life, her thoughts, her struggles, her good times, her bad times, and all of her choices. Her story was so real, and so raw, and I loved every bit of it. It was like I was with her the whole time! When it came to her relationships I was in love with Leo, I loved them together. But I also loved Nick. It's a tough choice but Leo has my heart. He was there for her, he saved her. He is Lilian's happily ending. I was really rooting for Nick and Lil to work, I was kind of jealous she scored a man like that! But everything happens for a reason, and somehow someway Leo and Lil ended up together again after 20 years.Everything that Lil went through hurt my heart, so many highs and lows had me turning the page and turning the page. It was an emotional rollercoaster. Life was good to Lil then it was cruel. They always say you should let these bad times make you stronger but that's not always the case. Sometimes life can hit you time after time and you start to become weak. She dealed with a lot, I felt for her. I sometimes wanted to take some of her pain away.Overall this book was simply great. I was left speechless, I won't be able to pick up another book for a while. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, of pain, happiness and everything in between. It's gritty and so real. This is Lil's story and I know there will be a book 2 with Leo's POV. I would reccemond this read to those who love a good ugly ugly emotional cry."
"I didn't think this series could get anymore amazing and any more heart wrenching but as always R.K Lilley NEVER fails to make me cry, laugh, scream and say &amp;#34;oh my god!&amp;#34; So many times. The relationship between Danika and Tristen in nothing short of steamy and a hot mess. He's a jealous maniac with the sex drive of a 16 year old boy. And it's hot!Danika's patience was tested as was Tristens. Danika had to deal with groupies from her mans past and Tristen had a hard time staying out of jail and trouble because his girlfriend is attractive and everything pisses him off. Tristen has been through a lot with the situation of his brother and now all his mother does is blame him. Some happy moments occur but are quickly shut down. These are the parts that killed me. I was rooting for them to fix the broken pieces but not everything can be mended.The story took so many different turns and now I have whip lash! I cried and yelled and I was shocked. THIS book.. This WHOLE series is just amazing. AMAZING."
"was a big joke not all the stuff was there and it is junk.  do not  waste your money on it."
"saves  your phone  screen and is a great piece for the money.  a great buy for your smart phone. get it."
"one was broken"
"The product is good quality and much better than previously owned bags. I have only used the bags once so far and they have gotten wet and still are high quality."
"Just got this case very nice It feels good and fits perfectly. It also comes with a screen protector that works perfectly I would defiantly recommend this"

"i must say, china has the best watch bands true solid 68grams 22mm for $8.85..i paid $24.99 for weak band by the time you get it on the watch ur watch is all scratched up, poor design..i know better now!!"
"Author had knowledge of New York City, antiques, people of privilege, and especially drugs.  There were brilliant descriptions and heartfelt emotions.  There was too much truth in the book -- the unrequited love and life is short imparts a feeling of hopelessness.  The fact that art endures seems to be the whole point of writing the book.  If you have nothing important to do, read it.  I found it to be a sad story with a sad ending and far too many words."
"Skirt fits true to size, daughter says it's very comfy.  Very versatile and stylish. A clothing item that we can both agree on."
"You can never go wrong or get bored with animals around  If you are an animal lover then this app is a must!"
"I liked the bravery and forward thinking survivalist young people.  No whining, just getting the job done.  I hope and pray there are tons of young adults out there who would take good skills and attitudes into their lives like these did."
"Compared to the original pens I had many years ago when the pens and black paper first came out, these pens are not as bright nor as opaque.  The original ones were much more opaque and the colors were brighter with a lot more contrast.."
"I love the product, I was new to scrapbooking so I had no idea how expensive it would get to be just to get the basic sets.  However, I love that I can use many other company's products on it with the adapter set.  I found many many videos on the web for other companies products and how to use them but few on the fuse.  It's pretty simple to use however.  I'm handicapped so the weight tends to be a problem (IT&amp;#34;S VERY VERY HEAVY!!!) but am working around it.  Several of the presses (butterfly, leaf, oval, etc.) are truly beautiful.  I'd sure recommend it, seems like each company has things to recommend theirs, but Fuse will give you the ability to use all their best stuff too so, how could you go wrong?"
"I love my purple leathet case I purchased for my Kindle HD. I would tell all my friends that this is the way to go...Love my Kindle...and the case!"
"Certainly an enlightening book. Gladwell's writing certainly suits his purpose, and after you finish the book you'll have a new perspective on &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; people."
"It was very easy to assemble, it took me a minute or two. I don't know why other people had problems. Once put together it is sturdy and very fun to use. Happy with purchase."
"Best christmas gift ever!! I swim every morning for 1 hour Mon- Fri at the gym and I don't think I can do it without music!! So far it's been working perfectly, no problems at all. Great customer service too!"

"What I like, is very good fills my heart with joy. And some subjects leave my head. Hahaha!!!They are a good alternative for the days you need them."
"Purchased for my elderly mother. She is very happy with the quality and pricing. It has become difficult trying to buy lambs wool locally. I was very pleased to be able to buy a good product in bigger quantities with excellent pricing."
"Been using it for 3 weeks and while I can't really tell if it looks thicker, my family and friends commented on it without me ever bringing up my hair.As for the smell, it only smells right after the shower and no one has ever brought it up."
"Does what it claims and does help in games like call of duty. Installation can be tricky if you've never taken apart a controller before. I also like the fact you can remove the screw so the trigger can be fully depressed for those games that require it."
"I just received it and ...no comment! definitely in love!true to size, and the platform make it perfect!gonna wear it with short dresses and trousers!"
"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my father over the holidays. He had a it about 2 to 3 weeks and it quit working. The screen became discolored and then it crapped out. I emailed the seller to see if I can return it and I heard nothing back. I emailed him in January. I still have the tablet sitting in a drawer. I do not recommend this product. I would really prefer my money back to be honest. Hope this helps you all."
"I love it only thing I have to say that sucks about it is that the little magnets throw off the pen, other then that it's great"
"is very interesting and easy to read book. Get you into life of others just like it is your own. I gave 10 out of 10 to author. Cant wait for more novels from Ameera"

"fit very well. My daughter loved the shoes. will probably order them in different colors. Cant beat the price. Thanks"
"Need to add stickers for access areas not covered by case for better blending of colors. My phone is red and it really stands out against the black background of the case. Howeverr I really do love the design and it holds on nicely."
"it works great for my drill i will tell my friends about it if they need any thing for there power tools"
"The sweater shows and displays what it actually is. I enjoy it and I believe it was worth the money."

"Great product.I enjoy it.Is a nice show piece fro my Hummer.Nice product. Nice product. Nice product.Great product.I enjoy it.Nice product. Nice product. Nice product."
"Great movie, gets better and better every time. It does have an enigmatic quality which no doubt contributes to the almost near obsessive replay value. So many tiny gems that at the end of the day, you have a full treasure chest of memorable jewels"
"Good reason to read a book and never put it down. I was really enthralled b  the book.David O."
"This was labled for children, but I'm a senior citizen and I enjoyed it very much.  The pictures are very pretty, the sound very good, and the variety of birds excellent.  I learned a number of bird calls I did not know before."
"Don't waste your money and time. It doesn't really work besides it only 20 bucks from dish. So just spend a few dollars more and get the real thing"
"I love the comforter set. The only thing was stitching came loose on the comforter seam and sham seam but easy to stitch."
"What a relief, it fits.  After stressing that I had ordered the wrong size, due to other reviews, what a relief to get this adorable hoodie and it fits like a dream.Just ignore your normal size, and order according the size chart from the seller.  That is what I did and it is perfect.  Just in case it helps, I am 5'6, 170 pounds and my bust is a 36B.  1x was perfect."
"I loved this product. It looks exactly like the picture and is the perfect size. It is also very stylish for someone who does not want to spend a ton of money on a diaper bag."
"This watch is the epitome of swagger. It has everything it said it has. Very happy with this buy. This is great product."
"Great product. Bought it for a friend and she loved them. No complaints. The blue lights are the best feature."
"Nice, doesn't run, very solid color when airbrushed.Fair warning goes on very vibrant and solid in color on buttercream and whipped icing but will fade significantly on whipped so spray it much heavier/darker than you are expecting the result to look like...I've never done it before but my wife with more than two decades experience doing cakes in bakeries walked me through it...our tie-dye cake started very, very dark and within an hour or so faded to a proper hippie tie-dye look."
"This is so soft and sweet...It really it sweet blanket an I know my daughter-inlaw will be thrilled that we ordered it..."

"Nice boot.fit as expected look very professional had no trouble with the boot.  Leather IS not real,but boot still looks great"
"This bottle of gel lasts a long time. If you use about 1 pump of the product daily, it will last you 4-6 month. The product is great because it does not leave any flakes in your hair and remains soft and moldable long enough for you to style your hair. It leaves a nice shiny, hard finish and is a great value."
"Recently bought this to go along with my new BMW. It's extremely soft and fluffy and pretty great quality. It looks great sitting in a BMW and would make a great gift for anyone with a BMW."

"I was not like description, i try it with Nikon Coolpix P510 Camera, it was described as it work with this camera but it was very bad one, gives bluer images, the camera work better without this lenses"
"I loved this one. I have both Inferno and just finished Rapture. A beautiful love story. Rapture was defintely better than Inferno, however, you have to read Inferno first to get the love story. I love how Gabriel is so in love with his beloved Julia. They are beautiful characters. I would love to see this in a trilogy to see how things go from here and follow the truest love story. And I would also like to see how the other characters in the book work out also. Racheal, Scott, Tom and his new romance, Paul (if the true friendship can last), but more than anything I'd love to see a reaction from Christa to know that she could not keep these lovers apart."
"All three features of this stylus are great.  The smaller tip is useful for editing email or with the smaller screen and print on your phone.  Larger tip good for scrolling/surfing and typing on a tablet."
"my dog seems to know what the remote is for ,he doesn't understand where the sound is coming from but he has stopped chasing the livestock and the cat since I put the receiver around his neck, for the price it was well worth the investment."

"Awesome and beautiful comforter! I have a tall pillowtop Queen bed so I bought the kingsize comforter and it fits perfect!"
"Perfect."
"This keyboard protector is a simplistic covering keeping the keys clean, but the right hand side does not sit properly over the keys. This causes the right side to lift; it seems a few millimeters too wide to fit correctly."
"The quality was fine, but these shoes were both too short and too narrow for my typically 7.5 B sized feet."
"The stones are clear and the color is great. Good for stacking with other rings. A nice price for tanzanite."
"Always like Andy and all the folks on the show, Dvd was clear and I really enjoyed it love Andy."

"The game is awesome but it asks you for an update and then you can't play till Yuri get the update, but there is no update."
"The best quiz game in the world. I could play this all day long. So fun. You should totally buy this."
"Needed for my cabinets, fits great and definitely gives me more space. Now I would like to buy a few more!!"
"This aquarium is sweet. I love the lights it makes your room glow. My only problem was the filter it came with is not very good. It doesn't keep the tank very clean. I would suggest getting something different if you want more than 5 fish. I found I was taking the water out and cleaning the entire tank every 2 weeks because of the build up algae and fish flakes the fish didn't eat. That's actually bad because your fish will be stressed from changing they're environment all the time. Most of the fish actually died Also do not put those claw frogs in there either, the tank won't be able to keep up with the mess they leave at all. I tried even putting a different pump in there but it just will not work because of the shape of the tank. I think if you want to buy this tank it has to be for looks only. To be able to maintain the aquarium and keep the fish healthy I suggest only having 3 very small fish."
"I like to enjoy Auction and fine good pice on ebay. I have to sit down and look for somebody bids me.."
"I've been waiting for sooooo long for this Book, and it is Amazing.......I'm from Germany and I read all of her books, there're really brilliant......I really hope that J.R Ward will release a Book of Darius, I want to find out more about him:DDDD.....It is soo Stupid that i have to wait 8 months until 'The King' will be release in Germany:(((("

"All fans that arrived were fully functional, they look great, it gives my pc a more gaming type of look."
"Great case for the price I will recommend it to anyone looking for a case for gaming, its very good."
"Liked the product worked great, but the thing I didnt like was that 3 of the 4 pins didn't actually bring 4 pins it brought 3 but even without it the fans worked great and ships very fast. Great product for good price"
"THIS book is so amazing and I recommend this book to all ofthe people who like books about werewolves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"Loved the book just as the ones before it.  I started with the first one at school then my mom said there was a second book and she bought it and I couldn't stop figgiting for this book and it amazed me just as the ones before!!!!!!!!!!!;) :) ;) :)"
"I was lucky enough to get Graveyard Speaks free and once I finished, I immediately went looking for this one. Haven't finished yet. A must read."
"I really like this type of game. The storyline was predictable though. Gave five stars  mainly because it is a good time waster. It is not one of my favorites and may not play again. Had plenty of hunt and find but I felt some were pointless. They didn't need all they put in and the story would've flowed better without some of them but I think they wanted to make sure purchaser had more game time. Which I am all for. But maybe they  could've put in more mini puzzles n place of the pointless hunt and finds. This sounds bad and you may be wondering why I gave it five stars, the game played well with no glitches and it can't be easy to try to make a game to please everyone. G5 has never failed in making games I enjoy. They deserve the stars because I just may be too critical you should definitely try the game yourself. You will get your money worth of time spent playing."
"In my opinion any game without PERMISSIONS is worth looking into. I happen to love word games and have some of this companies other word games. This game is very fun. Some of their groupings made me pause, but they did make sense, just remember they don't always go with  the most obvious answer. So far halloween is my favorite but Valentine's is easiest. Take a chance with this FAOTD, YOU will have fun"
"I don't leave a lot of reviews but this app has been out a while an d deserves a review. When you get a free app it is hit or miss.  This is a great story. Read in a clear voice. Interactive part is basic, touch the animal and it swims away, giving the child the chance to count each before it zooms off the page. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the page after the interactive animals it simply says &amp;quot;2 Seahorses!&amp;quot; for example but there are no seahorses.. I would have liked to have seen the animals too. Teaching your child anything involves a lot of repetition. Giving them another chance to count would've reinforced the number counted better.  But all in all, most free books are not always this well done. Thank you for giving us a great book."
"This book was great. I got it for the kids but as I was previewing the book I started laughing. You can't help yourself! As you read you say to yourself this is what  this friend does and that one is done well by that friend. My husband likes to rate burps, but I really think Tristan has given kids, and adults, a start at setting up a fart rating system. Will definitely be looking for book two."
"Finding short stories that are great is getting harder to do. The story never felt rushed and felt like something you would hear sitting around a campfire with your friends. I will definitely put this in my favorites list and look for more by this author."
"Amazing story! I would recommend this book to everyone.  I couldn't put it down.  I am impatient for book 2!  The characters are given with enough detail to draw you into their lives and have you rooting for them, or hating them. Gave 4stars because of all the errors, when you have to try to decipher what is being said it slows the pace and flow of the story."
"I loved reading this book. I hope the author writes more books about these interesting characters. Was a quick read but nothing was rushed. Characters had detail and kept you coming back to  find out what happens next. Plot had a twist I didn't see coming. Get this book and find a quiet corner! Enjoy!"
"I have played a lot of these games. I enjoy spending time with my kids trying to figure out the harder ones. Getting it as the faotd makes it even better."
"I mostly read fiction but this book had me coming back for more. I read parts to other family members. Some parts had me in tears and others left me gasping for breath I was laughing so hard. I wholeheartedly recommend this book, especially to other women. It gives you a new perspective on the kind of doctor you want to have caring for you."
"Couldn't beat the price so I thought I'd give it a try. It's faster paced than some of the other games out there, which I like. Works well on my kindle. So far. Wonderful for relaxing."
"Love the storyline and characters, but the ending seemed rushed. Almost like the author suddenly remembered this was supposed to be a novella. I would love to read more about the lives of the town's characters.  Also, the sequence of events seemed backwards in a few places, and  would've liked to have been in on the conversation with her boss when she quit. This book could easily be a full length book if the time was taken to do it. The author definitely has the talent and  imagination."
"Because of the pics on the cover and the description I thought this book would be good for younger kids. This book is not. This book would be enhanced with descriptive pics so a kid would know where in the body the author is describing. Facts are fine but they are not going to keep a child's attention long enough to learn them."
"This title was very misleading. I thought there would be patterns. Even one would have been nice. Title should have been Websites to help you learn to crochet for baby.....oh wait, you don't need a book after reading that title! This book started out like it was going to share a pattern, kinda, then it jumps to web sites that allow you to print patterns. Overall this book was confusing. If I could I wouldn't have given any stars."
"I agree with other reviewers for the most part. This title is misleading. The description of the book should have stated that the book is meant as a companion to the machines pictured in the book."
"I got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift because he's been wanting to get a big tattoo but he doesn't have the funds for it. Naturally, I saw this as a very fitting gift for him. It's bigger than I had expected, which is good because then it can hold more change. All in all, it's a cute and funny lil' bank and it did make me crack up when I took it out."
"Very funny entertaining for all ages.. Loved the music..!!!Easy to know were that movies was going to take me and my family!! Loved it***"
"The doll did not come with the stylus pen and when doing with hands its not as cool to the child .. Thumbs down"
"Speakers are loud and clear. They work great! Ive had no problens with this product. A great buy.  Sooo..... yeah."
"Definitely a fun book. Great humor and sarcasm and just a pinch of sass. This book has got some serious laughs out of me!!"
"This book has me anticipating its next volumes! I literally could not put it down and spent the entire second half of the book gasping or with my mouth agape! My emotions ebbed and flowed along with the characters.  I am left with an appreciation for men of integrity and feeling completely empowered as a woman."
"Another great book by James Patterson.  Kept me intrigued and riveted from start to finish.  Very enjoyable and a fabulous read."
"Works fine but hard to install. Should have choices on the oil pressure, as 100 psi is far to high for a lot of machines. I had to order an electric temp gauge to make it easier to install."
"It works and holds rifle snugly."
"Hope to never need it but when it come to electronics you can never be prepared enough, but better to have and not need it to need it and not have it."
"Color does matter and when I got my wife a Kindle Fire HD it only made since to cover it in her favorite color."
"I have simply loved it ever since I got it for my Kindle Fire HD. It cleans up so easy."
"I'm a 63 year old out of shape grandma, and even I can do this.  Still using the simple 10 minutes, but doing it twice until I feel I'm ready for the next step."
"This was a great video!! It had all the songs I would have definitly picked to listen to at a Metallica concert."
"It worked perfectly until PSN and Sony decided to update 4.10, afterwards its useless. Tried PSN support but their only useful answer was to get a new headset..."
"This case is very pretty.  Snapped on very good and and even.  I have a shield over the screen and it still fit perfectly with that applied. I recommend this"
"I read this story to my son a few times and we both absolutely love it! My son is attracted to the bold and bright pictures and he loves learning about the different types of birds in the story and is already memorizing their names! As a mommy and a preschool teacher though, I look at the deeper parts of the story of course. There is such a great message about loving and accepting the differences that we find in each other. This is a great lesson that we all strive to teach our children and this story tell that in such a fun and sweet way."
"WOW! I received a Pilot Acroball Pure White pen from Influenster for testing purposes and it was AMAZING! I used it to write an entire research paper and GUESS WHAT... Unlike most pens, it wrote smoothly and didn't smudge at all! It was so much cuter than a regular pen and felt better while I was holding it, but I didn't expect it to write so much better too. I would definitely recommend this pen to everyone!"
"the day the case came in the mail and i put it on my phone, the studs started falling off. they easily peel off"
"My daughter loves her case. It's easier for her to carry on and off the bus. She has a pcket to store her extra reads. thank you"
"The color was great . and it does what I need it to do protect my kindle. its great how it turns it on and off. Love it!"
"I have read the entire series all the way through this book and I look forward to the next book."
"I have to say that not only is this book amazing but also it answers everything I could have ever asked. I have read both of this authors books and they are just perfect! I love this book and I refer back to it very often. I find it hard to get help in the area I live as I work so much and theres not anywhere to go to be taught. This book has already taught me a great deal. It not only covers how to throw but also the position you should be in and common errors. I am also going back to the author's website (pottery-on-the-wheel.com) and reading the blogs posted there as well as they can be very informational and helpfull too. I cannot wait for this author to produce a third book.SincerelyKatrina from Florida"
"Their customer serv called me to verify my address. Very attention to detail. That type of customer service is non existence today if it involves $ to spend. Hesse guys did aweome"
"I was researching MSM pills for my hair, but stumbled across info about the cream for skin. After reading the reviews, I ordered a jar. I am now on my 3rd jar and LOVING IT! I was the queen of acne/oil face crap, and now only use this!! My prescription face cream can't even compare to this!! I have my sister and mom both using it now. I had super oily and acne prone skin, and now since using this after washing my face, it has disappeared! I hope they never stop making this stuff!"
"These are extremely tasty, but do melt very very quickly. I pop 3-4 at a time, and it's only a few seconds before they are gone. I enjoy the taste at least for a moment."
"This case is by far the most useful investment I have put into accessories for my cell phone.  The case is very nice and has great quality."

"Excellent pneumatic flooring nailer at a great price. We've been working to install our hardwood floors over the past few weeks and this nailer has been perfect for us. Cheaper than renting a nailer for that time period and much cheaper than big name brands. Very pleased with the product."
"These friends are great at entertaining. This show always puts me in a good mood and gives me a good laugh. I can watch the same episodes over and over again."

"Actually  purchased these to replace blown DB521  I believe the previous ownerused a 300 watt amp to power the old ones"
"Jordy PalloEsta novela es  muy interesante, en sus cap&amp;iacute;tulos nos narra circunstancias que se viven en la actualidad, ademas Santiba&amp;ntilde;ez es un excelente contador de historias, debido a estas caracter&amp;iacute;sticas hace que el lector siga atrapado por el suspenso.Utiliza un lenguaje muy directo, no utiliza tantas figuras literarias lo que hace f&amp;aacute;cil de entender la novela, usando oraciones claras.Pude leer esta obra literaria la pude leer en el taller de lenguaje II y definitivamente la puedo recomendar, ademas podemos entender mejor la literatura ecuatoriana."
"But I was able to make it work. Sturdy plastic, decent lock. I do wish that the hinges were a bit stronger but no bad."

"I luv the mommy wigs I have numerous  colors ,they run out of #1fast in the beauty shops.so I order this color online,this my second one from here ,,only reason it's not a 5 because of the way it shrinks when you wash it"
"This product did nothing ..waste of money,, along with the face cream..should have gotten a refund but didn't I know next time"
"Have not got a chance to ride long with these. But they were easy to install (used small amount of dish soap), and when I sat on the bike and just played with throttle, it was a lot more padding and felt comfortable. We will see how they hold up to this weekend after a few hours of riding."
"I bought this bag specifically for using on a motorcycle, will see how it holds up. There is no padding on the actual strap of the sling, but I can easy add some if needed. It will hold my water bottle and some small items and snacks while out for a ride."
"This is one good book in which I rate a 5/5. I like it because it was very funny. I would highly recommend to read for all book lovers."
"A highly known skylander in all of the skylander fans, Trigger Happy is back and better than ever in Series 2. You know, this tech-element skylander will never grow old around the world. He came in the Skylanders Spyro's Adventure starter pack ( along with Spyro and Gill Grunt). He still is rocking with his golden pistols and safes. His pistol and safe path are the same, but he has an awesome wow-pow power now. While using the golden machine gun, press the primary attack to fire out a mega blast.Even if you already have Series 1 Trigger Happy , you should buy this one to ( I'm not crazy people). Overall he is like the best one so far in the tech element ( my opinion). Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants"
"I was caught up in the story from the beginning, and sadly thinking  such a scenario or outcome is truly possible."
"love this book...i highly recommend this book for a great exciting story that you do not want to end...onward to book 3"
"I love this book and all the extras that come with it. I like that I can either chose to read it or have the video played. Additionally, there are games and many surprises that come with this app."
"I loved this the shipping was so incredible! they told me i was to have it between Dec 6th and the 10th i recieved it today the 7th i was incredible at how fast i recieved it! plus i think me stepson is really going to love it! he is a ninjago lover! thats all he talks about so he's getting this and the comforter (when it gets here, it was out of stock when i placed my order :( which i was wondering why because if amazon knows its a popular item then keep it in stock! please?) for christmas!!!!"
"Quality, quality, quality and made in the USA! I've used a single fuel version of this stove since i started tent camping over 40 years ago and it was 10 years old when i got it! I tent camp regularly. The stove is simple and when parts wear out they are easily and cheaply replaced which is why they last a lifetime. I'm looking at a new one as a gift.I used a propane stove briefly and had trouble with leaking propane containers and dislike the waste of disposing the metal tanks. After two uses, I went back to using this one. The side guards are very effective in high winds."
"Good story if you like this one you need to see Double ImpactMy friends and I all want to be locked in the bathroom with JCVD NOW!!!"
"I did not know this item was fake until I compared it with my friend's newly purchased one at the mall. It is well copied if you don't care the detail , but you could obviously tell it is fake if you see real one. Material is low quality, voice muffled by case ,A built-in screen protector is bad quality and hard to see, etc.. Not even a well-made copy.  I regret not realizing this sooner..."

"Definitely worth watching! The wife in this story is in need of some serious help. She doesn't have a clue about marriage and it's give and take. Where is her heart. Good for discussion at the round table."
"I'm the kind of girl who doesn't wear skirts too often, so when I wanted to get one, I wasn't sure what to get.  I'm glad I picked this as one of my first skirts.  A lot of skirts that I've seen around stores are super thin and look like they can break easy.  This one was made of a thicker material.  I guess you can compare it to felt, but I'm 100% sure it's not felt.  It just had that texture to it, and is more stiff than felt actually is.  The skirt is at a fair length on me, a couple inches above the knee.  Maybe for someone of my stature it would be nice to have some shorts under, but otherwise, I thought it was really cute.  I bought the black one, and I wouldn't be surprised if I bought another!"
"Better than the movie. A must read excellent characters. I enjoyed every page. Leo Tolstoy is a great writer. Recommend this book to any one"

"It stains like crazy! But it leaves a really rich color. It also washes off a lot as you shower which sucks a lot!"
"Paint chips off easily. Smells gross. I don't recommend them at all. Get a better cover, just not this. . . . . . ."
"Bad Ass. Stuck them on my nerdy girlfriends convertible car as a surprise, she loves them. But my dicepticons eclipse is better haha"

"LOVE this app! Best one in the app store so far!!! Quick and easy downloads! It installs and extracts itself! Immediate play maps! Really good for kindle tablet mc pe! Only thing is that maps are limited. They have quite a bit now, but could use a bit more. But once you check out most of them, then you'll be locked in the fun amazingly detailed maps!"

The product does not lather up well and it's quite greasy, but it helps my dog's skin and fur stay soft."
"Bethel creates some of the best worship I have ever heard.  Good really spesks to my wife and  I  with this album."
"I ordered 2 chargers among 9 other items from Amazon from different sellers, the charges were the last items that i recieved and there was no any way to track the shippment as this option was not available by the seller. then upon finally recieving the 2 chargers I found that one of them is faulty :(.. so disappointing indeed."

"This propane hose for a Mr. Heater ""Buddy portable Heater"" is ""A Must Have Item"" for use in long term without heat emergencies, or several days use while camping in cold weather. ""This Model # F273704 States That It Does Not Require A Fuel Filter"", like other hoses do. I recommend This Hose Assembly"" but not the ""Seller/Shipper I purchased it from, ""Very Slow Shipping"" !"

"Nice fiber optic sight, and it produces a red/orange dot that makes you able to point your shotgun on target very fast, again it's ""A VERY NICE Fiber Optic Sight"", and well worth the purchase price, and it fit my Mossberg 500A 12ga shotgun with 18.5"" barrel very nicely.  I would recommend this sight, and the ""Seller"", I give both a (5* Rating)JM"
"""Pleasant surprise"", the folding shovel blade is made using strong carbon steel materials, with strong welds, and not cheap rivets, The little shovel should be able to take a fair amount abuse, I think it should hold up well, I give this product, and the ""Seller"" a (5* rating) !"

"If you're a diabetic, buy this cable, it's used to download the blood sugar (glucose) test reading from your OneTouch glucose test meter to your computer.  I have the OneTouch Ultra 2 Test Meter, and all I had to do then was download the free OneTouch software from their web-page online, and then I connected my test meter using this USB download cable, the cable then allowed my OneTouch Test Meter to transfer all of my test readings onto the software programs spread sheet, to fax, e-mail, or print out a copy to send to my doctor.  &amp;#34;Being Very Honest With YOU&amp;#34;, If You're A Diabetic, You Need To Give Some Thought To This USB Data Download Cable !"

"Great addition to my lathe. Makes drilling blanks super easy. I would buy this item again, it's a must have!"
"1. Awesome Product for the price. Strong and perfect for those deep knots all athletes will have. Seriously, if you don't think this is strong and doesn't work out the knots around your body, you're either using it wrong, somehow, or you need to get yourself a PVC pipe. Enough Said.2. Unfortunately you may have one side sawed off.  I used a finishing spray on the end so that it doesn't degrade. Works pretty well and no stray foam is fallen off and I've used it a handful of times. So, pretty lame, but it's not falling apart at all.Big turn off, I have to say about it being cut. However, this is an excellent product for the price and works extremely well. Try finding another high density foam roller for this price. I actually did AT MY GROCERY STORE???. Idk how that happened, but i found it there days after I purchased this and it was 100% intact. I kicked myself in the ass for that one. But oh well. This is a Great product and I have zero complaints besides that.**You may read on here that it's not that hard, but trust me, I've been rolling for a year now, and this roller is the next best thing to a PVC pipe. It's a great price and is very strong. I weigh 165 - 170lbs, can stand on top of this roller and it gives very very slightly, obviously, it's foam, but it's not going to fail you and indent after heavy use."
"Perfect for what I needed. Even if I was going to wear it, it would have been great. I actually needed it for a present to put on a stuffed animal, so I have zero complaints. Not sure how long the clear rubber wire would hold up if you're trying to wear this thing around, but it seems stretchy and for the price, you cant beat it. Good luck finding this around your neighborhood. You guys rock for having this!"
"This is good ONLY for light jobs. Anything remotely tough, and it will fail. Not worth the price in that regard alone. Otherwise, for light jobs it is okay."
"I don't have personal experience with it, but received no complaints, and the person I gifted said she liked it. It does make a nice, quick, and thoughtful gift for teen girls when you need something."
"It's a very fun game to play. Very very addictive. Hard to put down. Would tell other people about this game."
"The best horror/mystery book I have ever read! I couldn't put it down! I suggest everyone read this if they're look for a good scare. Stephen King don't stand a chance now."
"Awesome upbeat song that really gets the right point across! We are going to start doing this song as our closing song for church!"
"My husband has diabetes and a size 13 foot but the diabetic socks are so loose. He looks for socks that aren't too tight around the ankle. I had bought Hanes that were thicker in the foot but they also ended up tighter on the ankle.  He seems to like these just fine. I will most likely buy them again."
"Used these for deep sea fishing in cabo Mexico found the lenses to be very flimsy but the glare was greatly reduced for the price they are great not worried about dropping them or anything like that"

"I bought and liked two similar Fujitsu scanners, about $2,500 worth, and used them in my business. They worked fine. Then Windows updated from XP, and Fujitsu has not updated drivers for either of these devices for any newer system.I now own $2,500 worth of plastic Fujitsu bricks.So, buy a Fujistu scanner if you must--and be sure you get all your scanning in before MS comes out with a new version of Windows."
"DID NOT EVEN SEND A BUFFING PAD WITH POLISHER TOO USE?NOTHING???? SO WHEN YOU SELL THIS PRODUCT YOU SHOULD AT LEAT HAVE SOME KIND OF BUFFING ATTACHMENT SO YOU CAN AT LEAST TRY OUT THE POLISHER?"
"These are OK.  The way they are packaged causes some of them to not lay flat which sometimes makes them appear cheap looking, but this probably cannot be avoided without more costly packaging.  That is my only negative comment.  They are good for what they're used for - disposable."
"The pad is something that we need to get use to it, but design, speed, and anything else, are very good.I recommend this laptop."
"It protects my tablet really well, and I love it's simplicity and practicality, really does it's work well, thank you!"
"I have been interested in this case since I saw it covered on 48 Hours a few years ago. I definately have been a believe in their innocence, and was elated when the WM3 were release. I found Damien's story interesting and compelling. I enjoyed the inside look into his life and thoughts. His spirit amazes me."
"Nothing I didn't already know. I didn't find it very scary or interesting. Glad I didn't waste much money !"

"For the money I think this is really good hardware for my intended purpose. I bought this hardware pack so I could setup a practice kit in my spare bedroom since all my other high end hardware is utilized on other kits. I have to admit it's quite basic and fairly lightweight, but it serves it's intended purpose well. Even the kick pedal has descent action after I got it dialed in and put a better beater on it. I wouldn't recommend this hardware to anyone who does a lot of gigging because I don't think it would hold up to all the rigors of constant setup and teardown. I would spend the extra bucks on something more high end for gigging drummers. If you're just looking for stands for a rehearsal or a beginner kit, than I highly recommend this hardware pack."
"It is the real thing, not a toy like so many others of its kind.the price was very good as well."

"I can't get enough of Jason Uptons music. His music transports me to heaven. Love to listen and worship. Holyness."
"1st night used, slept like a magical charm was used.  And 1st good night my daughter and hubby slept through, too!!!"
"What can I say? It's an amazon gift card, and amazon is better than any physical store, so why get a gift card that's limited to a specific building when the possibilities are endless with a gift card for one of the largest (if not the largest) shops online?"
"This is a starter for me.I've lived and worked offshore since the early '90s and I'm teaching myself navigation.This will wind up in my emergency kit on my dinghy along with my flares,EPIRB,water,nutrition bars and a bottle of Scotch.Thank you."

I didn't need to use a chain cutter because it came with 96 links. Quality is great for the price I paid. Haven't had any problems with it."
"I received my order on the same time as it was mentioned. The spacer is awesome becuase it fits to my requirement."
"I received the bar exactly as it is shown in the store. Its nice and pretty smart. Value for the money"
"I like the style and stuff. When I was purchasing I was not sure what I will get but the product is really excellent. Thank you"
"I know this item may seem iffy, but it turns that this product is actually great for weight loss. This isprobably best product you will find that uses chlorogenic acid, which helps you burn fat. It is a simplesupplement to use and it shouldn't change your diet(if you so happen to be on one)."
"Excellent stuff and great quality. I must recommend this handlebar to every one. Thanks for the great stuff again :)"
"This is the best cache cleaning up android software available. It is powerful and efficient.Don't delete useful info or applications as some other cleaning up apps do. Some other appsdelete even essential data of op-system. The result is a system crash. This one knows how tochoose real garbage. Totally reliable and extremely useful."
"I wasn't sure how to use this thing at first. I used the manual and plugged it and connected it with my android tab. The result is pretty amazing and I got all real time data from car's ECU on my screen real fast. I was totally impressed. This scanner is fast, accurate and totally trustworthy."

"What a fun book!  This was a pleasurable read; Chet was a terrific narrator and his perspective gives a whole new level of humor to the story.  I enjoyed it as an action mystery as well-- the plot wasn't obvious, which made it a real page-turner.  Definitely looking forward to reading more in the series."
"this product its not original, you send me a cellphone with parts made in china, i bought a Samsung with original parts, and you send me a chinesse version"

As an added note, this remote has the setup codes for hundreds of TVs and other devices."

"So many healthy ways to make things so delicious. I loves them and they really are do easy to make."
"I gave this product a 5 rating because the characters are bright colorful and adorable, they attract young children with their cute animals and bright green background. They looked just as described and arrived quickly ( 4 days). I liked getting an order confirmation email which was followed a couple days later by a confirmation email that my item was shipped. They provided quick &amp; easy return information along with my item (just in case) - which I liked as well. I absolutely recommend this item."
"Tinker and Linda Pearce have created a new approach to the history of Dwarves, Humans and Goblins. This epic tale is told from the point of view of Engvyr Gunnarson, the Dwarven Rifleman of the the title.Yes, there's conflict between nations and peoples. Yes, there's a war. Yes, there's grief and loss to deal with. Yes, there's a love story. But the bottom line here is that it's a timeless story of family and what lengths a person will go to in order to keep family and community safe.These are personalities that will get into your head, and you'll notice you're starting to look at things differently in your world as the story sweeps you along in theirs.Enthusiastically recommended!"
"I loved this short story...I kept trying to turn to the next page when I was already on the last page.  I think this short story could easily be a chapter in a much longer book by this author.  It will get inside your head and leave you wanting more."
"I really love this brand and this Hoodie is really great.It fits perfectly and has a very good made."
"Good case. This was my first computer build and I absolutely love the case. Came with everything described as well."

"these little monkeys were a hit at my daughters babyshower,  I made them into a centere piece for the tables and each guest was able to take one home.  I placed sand in the bottom of a 4&amp;#34; glass then poured wax on top of the sand and placed the little mokey in the melted wax so he will stay still.  then a accented the glass with a yellow ribbon to go with his banana.  Everyone loved them!"
"I would recommand this movie to people I know. I rate this movie a 5 star it was an awesome movie."
"The reason why i choose this rating is it came with one charger, the remote should have a separate button to control each collar. I mean if i wanted to buzz one dog instead of both dogs you would be able to. This remote only has one small black button to buzz them so if you want to buzz one dog you wouldn't be able to."
"Lovely product. Its hard to get rasperry liqurice in the US  (most red liqurice is strawberry) and this is the best."
"Very interesting, good book! Definitely would recommend it. Even though it is an adult book I would recommend it for teens also."
"Being an herbalist, I have done some research on these ingredients.  Mostly good things, and a few bad.  However, I can say that my husband and I have not been this &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; in years!  Give this product a try.  Nothing works on everyone (those little blue pills didn't do much for my husband), but I would certainly recommend giving this a shot!"
"This product is very well manufactured.  Most fish oil pills have oil on the outside of the pill, I assume from the manufacturing process, and taste like freezer burned fish.  Not these.  No fishy taste in the mouth when you take it or any later that I've noticed.  Excellent product and will buy again."

"I ordered this book for my son.  He is enjoying reading and learning the pros and cons with opening your own business."
"I bought this charger for my gba sp and at first I was extremely disappointed, but after messing with the charger a bit I got it to work. All I had to do was use a small screwdriver to pop up the little metal pieces at the end of the cord so they would connect with the sp. So now it works like a charm."
"This is a piece of art, the way they describe France seems really accurate for those years. I have watched this film some times by now, but I could not finish it the first time. Be prepared for a really shocking movie! I have seen more movies than the average population but Irreversible is still a piece of art."
"I was worried about the flavor, but it is ok, For me it is about two to three days to be accustomed to toothpaste's flavors. I love trying new products and I guess I can use this for more than a year, which is a lot for me."
"The design is great but the quality is not the best, I have used it maybe 20 times (2 months) by now and it seems like I have been using it for the double of time, I have other belt that actually look like new even within a year of use."
"I have seen this movie at least four times. I like the photography, content and all the actors do a great job. I am waiting for the next one!"

"i apreciate the concern about how we feel about the items we purchase ! the only thing is that we CANT really judge how we feel if we haven't received the item first.  maybe there is a way to change the system where you guys get notified after the customer receives it .  thanks  again"
"I started taking these a little over a month ago, and I already lost 16lbs! I cannot wait to see how much I can lose in another month! It is so easy to take and it is actually working for me! I would suggest buying these and giving them a try."
"i got this game and i got to 7gb and it reset at 0.it wont even download when i get far it will reset on mei wont ever get a game download from amazon ever!!!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I finished 2 things this week:1.)  My sister's new book,  THE ART OF FLOATING.2.)  My brother-in-law's homemade Irish chutney that I brought back to NC following my travels to Maine and Massachusetts.I cozied up this past week in my favorite reading nook in my comfy overstuffed chair complete with an ottoman and a blanket....my nose buried in THE ART OF FLOATING.  Several nights I stayed up past my regimented bedtime simply because I could not put the book down.In my most unbiased opinion (well....maybe I'm a little biased.  I mean she is my sister and all.  Not to mention brilliant, artistic and worldly!) my sister produced a treasured story.  While the power of losing something is often indescribable, my sister puts into words what so many of us are unable to describe.  So vivid, so true and most importantly, so relatable.Just like my brother-in-law's famous chutney straight from his mom's SECRET Irish recipe book, THE ART OF FLOATING is full of mystery and intrigue...with a little bit of spice that make it all its own!  The book combines the power of loss and the glory of discovery AND the process of healing in the face of tragedy.This story is told with a sweetness so tender it will open your heart.  You did it, sis!  THE ART OF FLOATING is truly a work of art that the world should hear.  And as my dad (who typically sticks to books and articles related to history and politics) stated &amp;#34;This isn't just a woman's book.  Everyone should read this!&amp;#34;I love you, Kristin Bair O'Keeffe!!  Congratulations!!"
"This whole book is not what I expected. He is writing stories about his life.And it is a big mistake from your side, I could not click to view to see what is the subject in this book.I would not by it.Is it possible to send it back?Thank you."
"I must admit I was skeptical as the last time I purchased this product from another vendor I paid over 200.00. This product was not only unbelievably less expensive it works great. I would absolutely recommend this purchase and if I ever need it again this is my link."
"The second book in the saga of the Honorverse by David Weber.  I reread them every year or so!  They hard to put down once you start reading them."
"This book got my full attention  I love it..This book was well written,I've read the series abt three times and I could read it again."
"I love this product! It is absolutely perfect for what i use it for. But there are some minor problems but are barely noticeable if you're like me.The only problems I've encountered is a buzz in the left earphone but when i'm playing COD there is a lot of action and is not noticeable until the action dies down or until i'm in the pre-game lobby.The only other problem is when i go at-least 15 feet away from the receiver it cuts in and out of connection but again barely noticeable if you're actually playing the game.But overall i give this headset a 4 because of its pros."
"The pictures are cute, but the numbers on the calander  are so small,you have to get very close to it to see it."

"Great shoe, just like the rest of the Zigs I've purchased. I just wish they had a little more arch support. but overall, I love them!"
"I had ordered the wrong size several times as I was getting the shoes as a gift. The service was great and I was able to change my order without jeopardizing the time the shoes came in. They worked with me every step of the way! I'd buy again for sure and would highly recommend the product. After a month the shoes are still looking great and being enjoyed."
"Words cannot describe how much I loved this product! It came much earlier than the expected date. I apply it after I shower and it does an amazing job detangling my hair :) Love this product."
"This product smelled nice and manly. However, the scent didn't last very long. Most car freshners don't, so it isn't much different from the others."
"These are simple black acrylic tapers; they came in time but not in the correct color. They actually came in clear. I didn't mind but just beware of inconsistency!"
"when I first got this I liked it a lot but every time I got my bow out of my case the sight had moved you are not able to tighten it enough to stay in place so you bump it getting into your stand it moves."
"It's ok I mean I have seen better and some of the puzzles r hard. I'm just commenting for the free hint so yeah."
"Works really good and can almost fully charge my galaxy s4. It also charges really fast in just a couple hours"

"My three year old granddaughter was fascinated and she is difficult to entertain! I even enjoyed the book myself and loved watching her sitting so still listening attentively."
"Great value. Upgrade to steel drive shafts, plastic ones broke after 3 batteries. Not even running lipo. 2wd slash is fast and powerful. ESC is not waterproof and has no mounting pegs. Overall great combo."
"When I ordered this, I had a 34DD chest and 38&amp;#34; hip. I had gotten a large. But it hugged my hips and butt really tight and unflattering, and strapped my boobs down, thus making them look saggy. I loved the color and material, and if you  are more petite, this would be great for you! But for curvier girls, like myself, I would not recommend."
"When I first got it, I loved it! I loved the color, the material, etc. However, I was wearing push-up a bra when I first tried it on. I am quite busty (34DDD), I had got a Large, and it was still way too baggy in the chest! When I tried to wear it with a push-up bra, it went really low and I had cleavage for days. When I didn't wear a push-up bra, it was really baggy. If you have time and money to get it tailored, or if you like extra cleavage, this is definitely the costume for you! It was comfortable and all, it was just hard to constantly be pulling up the front."
"These arrived quickly and were a great quality product! My husband loved them and my daughter was thrilled since she gave them to her Daddy for Christmas! :)"
"My son LOVES the Hulk! This was a top item on his Christmas list! The item arrived quickly and was in perfect shape! He has already watched it twice! Price was good too!"

"really fun,best of its kind,but it needs to have updates,multiplayer would be cool to add and when I play my Huns are glithced and they look rainbowy.please fix this bit.Overall its awesome."
"Clearly,  a retyped knock off brand.  The front cover isn't even consistent with the front cover they show on their page.  After one month of use most of the pages started falling out of the binding.  It also caused me to turn in several incorrect homework assignments, because the section problems didn't align with the section problems in the legitimate 8th edition version.  When I reported this complaint the seller didn't even get back to me.  Don't buy this book from this seller!!!"
"Came with everything stated in the description.  Sleek look with protective cover. Couldn't of asked for anything more for the low price."
"I was VERY happy with this product. My biggest concern was delivery and this arrived BEFORE Christmas!! THANK YOU. I ordered it close to the holiday but still received it. The jacket is good quality, my boyfriends states it's warm without being heavy and is large enough for him to fit a hoody underneath it at work. Thanks again."
"Love t this stuff ! I am diabetic and I have tried many sweeteners. My search is over YACON, is the answer!  It does not have the nasty taste like other sweeteners do. I have also found I have more energy since using Yacon. I love this stuff, thank you Yacon!"

"delivery is so fast, good!!!I went road trip with this!!!but no protect film for lenses and screen...i thought the film was in package...."

"I give this 5 mega stars! I LOVE Dork Diaries and Nikki! Way to go Rachel Renee Russel!:D!Loved it!"
"I am so happy I ordered these sofa legs. I bought brand new couch about six months ago. I looked on the internet and in various furniture show rooms looking for taller furniture. I'm 5'8"" and most of the furniture was too low for me so I bought a sleeper sofa for the extra height and support. Most of my family and friends are tall so low sofas are a problem for most of us. These legs raised my couch up four more inches making it more comfortable and easier to sit down on and get up from. I have already recommended it to my family and friends before receiving them. I would recommend these legs for big tall disabled and older people. Also I received the legs a week ahead of schedule. I will be ordering these legs again for all of my sofas."
"I had stray cats crawling under my house and fleas came inside the house. I had to use several different products inside and outside of the house for weeks to finally get them out of the house. Plus I had a neigher block off the entry points with chicken wire. I haven't had a problem since. I also check the crawl space under my house to see if they're squeezing through the blockade. I only used this product in the house, so I'm not sure how well it works alone and I had to use products almost daily for  a few days to break the flea cycle."
"My five year old son loves it. I bought this for Christmas a year ago. Unfortunately he broke the screen about the four months later and I had to buy another one. He plays with the tablet almost daily. I would suggest getting the rechargeable batteries and downloading th apps instead of the cartridges. I don't have to worry about him dropping the cartridges and breaking them. Plus it's easy to switch the downloaded apps to a new learning tablet."
"Enjoyable reading.  Faith and family are uplifted in this story and life's tragedies and heartache turn to joy in the end."
"Good reading, enjoyable. I enjoyed reading about the clothes and culture of the period. A romantic, sweet, and uplifting tale."
"This is not built for a spotting scope. May be good for a small camera but is to weak for a spotting scope. Is light weight and easy to carry in a back pack but not stable enough for a large scope."
"While I am not familiar with Phillipa Gregory's novels, I took a chance on this series because of my interest  in this moment in history. I was hoping for something along the lines of &amp;#34;Vikings&amp;#34;----- a balanced mix of drama &amp; action. But this is more like Downton Abbey in tights, heavy on the romance while all the action (the battles, anyway) takes place off-camera. This is definitely aimed at a female audience The political situation at the end of the Wars of the Roses was extremely complicated , but it seemed to be over-simplified, at least as it was presented in the first episode. I may or may not  take a chance on the second episode, to see if the aura of Romance sets the tone of the entire series."
"Great tablet. One of the best 7 inch tablets there are. Love amazon prime. Will definitely by this again for my family."
"This book is interestingI really like it because it's kind of like diary of a wimpy kid. Great bookBye"
"This is the best steamer I've ever used. Hope it lasts longer than my Hahn.Great product because it can clean both hard floor and carpet."
"I love how this show feels in the footbed and the impact cushion of the sole construction, but the shoe was way too big in my usual size and is very fashionable. Unfortunately their are none left to order in a smaller size."
"This was a great product. I would recommend it to anyone. Look forward to many more purchases from Avery. Great Job!"
"I bought this for my 6 yr old son. He loves DD and watches this thing every day on the way to school."
"Great product for the average beer drinker. I use this thing daily and keeps my beer cold very very well."
"Very hard to believe, but oh well, is a nice quaint love story, cute. Adults viewers only. Teenagers will never get it."
"To me is very candid and real down the core of the story, it is a cartoon, but seen a kid loosing his foot in the first movie, WOW that was unexpected, and the great follow up in how these characters keep on living with dragons.!!!I love it!!! And toothless is timeless!!!"
"The book Comforting Children in Crisis was written by Group Publishing Company to serve as a tool in helping every professional who interacts with kids to know what to do in any given situation where a kid is considered in a crisis situation. The sections are organized into a short anecdote and followed by differing tips, depending on the person that tip section is meant for. This method of organization is easy to understand, and makes most sections easy to find.This book has some issues, such as attempting to address everything conceivable that could happen to a kid, instead of focusing on principles. The attempt to deal with twelve different topics in under two-hundred pages makes the book seem more like a list of tips or to dos than a helpful resource. The tips themselves are good, if repetitive at times, but take up more space than anything that is likely to help a person understand the given situation and what they need to do about it, other than a short list of what to say and what not to say and one or two ways to help. Granted, this book is written for the general public, but the differing sections of tips for counselors and other professionals seems almost excessive. Also, it just tries to make things into a cookie-cutter list of actions instead of principles to employ, and is less flexible than would be desired for a usable tool.The negative side being dealt with, this book is an excellent quick-reference guide for anyone who has no clue what to do, and has some good ways to do triage on a kid to figure out who they need to talk to. The main use for this book would be to both remember some guidelines about what&amp;#8217;s happening, and also to give the worker a refresher on each item being addressed. That is what I think of Comforting Children in Crisis."
"Very good antiaging  effects,. I would like to trie the eyes antiaging cream! better skin sight specialy arround eyes and mouth"
"Lip sync off-movie had to keep reloading-Not a good experience-Have found that the &amp;#34;Free&amp;#34; movies all have this issue.Not real happy with the Prime Video."

"1. mount on desk or table 2. mount screen 3. adjust to your viewing using pleasureYUP it is that friggin easy!I just wanted a simple quick way to mount my 24 inch monitor in my spare room. I have swapped out 2 monitors on there and it continues to be just as durable. The aluminum is strong and easy to wipe down and keep clean. Love it for my extra bedroom."
"A very well structured book. It is not only a good book on Java Threading, it is also an example for all others to follow when writing about programming, or indeed any other subject. The examples are very short, but packed with wisdom. Buy this book!"
"I bought this for my nephew he was happy now  he can play his tablet. well 2-3 weeks later the pin that you plug into tablet broke. now he's a little upset so of course I'll have to get him another one. wish this could be fixed."

"This book was very well written. As you read you feel as if  you are actually there. A must read for those interested  in the air war over Germany."
"This book was an easy read, has three 30-week training schedules to choose from, and has good descriptions and explanations."
"The bracket rusted within a few weeks :("
"Very flimsy.. looks just like the photo"
"Good quality, exactly like photos!"
"Stretch the material. These boots are high quality and did not rip even a single thread as I pulled and stretched them for my wife. I'm 6`1 270 and can pull relatively hard. I honestly would have expected any pair of boots to be destroyed by the stretching but they held up. I really wanted to see these on my wife, and it was worth the effort. Stretch `em before you return `em."
"I hooked it up to my Asus vh236h and it transmitted Audio to my receiver. This is the thing people must know though,IMPORTANT!Toslink/Optical cables DO NOT carry true surround sound audio. They were made to carry Dolby Digital and DTS.Therefore, if your audio transmitting device (Such as: SoundCard, TV or DVD Player) does not support either of these formats, this cable will transmit in PCM 2.0. That means you will only get sound out of 2 of your speakers."

"There's not much to say, the case has done a good job. My iPad has no scratches or anything wrong with it."
"I got the camera after doing alot of research - I was able to set it up for wireless communication in very little time - very straight forward procedure.  The port forwarding took a call into technical support and they helped me set it up.  Very happy with this camera - good quality pictures and easy to use.  Thanks Foscam."
"I liked it because it kept me interested to keep reading it.  yes I would recommend it to someone else."
"Friendship film is one the best family I have seen. My family and I love this movie for a few years now. We have watched over and over and still enjoy it as much asthe very first time we watched it. A must see movie!"
"I choose 4 stars because I thought this was a good book. There was always something going on and the emotions in this book really stood out. Everything came together so it all made sense and makes it a easy choice to read the second book. So much goes on that it doesn't get boring, every chapter holds a different problem."
"We just got a new matress and had to have something to cover it because lets admit nothing is more gross than sleeping on a disgusting looking matress at night and its not very romantic either... Well being the poor people we are we thought we would buy this cheap cover. Now we have a 1&amp;1/2 year old boy that LOVES to spill everything and be messy like every other two year old. This matress cover keeps your matress clean BUT so can a tarp. You might as well put a tarp on your mattress because it would cost the same, feel the same, and sound the same. It is super noisy....(if you didnt get that by now) at first we were like oh its no problem but after 6 months of dealing with it well its getting pretty annoying. we tried putting 6 quilts between us and the matress and its just as loud as before. it is soooo bad. if you even shift in bed the other person gets woken up. if you get up at night the other person gets woken up. I can hear my husband roll around in bed when im watching tv in the other room (we live in a apartment) honestly just save more money and get the kind that isnt plastic."
"I have a one year old son and we gave him this toy for Christmas. he absolutely loves it. he likes the music mode best, he LOVES music. he understands that if he pushes one of the shapes down they sing and light up with the music which gets him dancing of course. he thinks it's a fun toy an  consumes his interest."
"I didn't like these at all. I spent an hour on one screen trying to get it on but no matter what there was bubbles in it. I spent hours trying to stick them on and bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. It was a waste of money and you can't even get your money back. Total waste of time. I'm VERY disappointed."
"First of all, I supposed to get 3 in 1 but I only get the fish eye and lens I never get the micro lens . So I rate this for 3/5 but it doesn't mean I didn't like it. I like/love but if I have the micro lens then ill be more happier. But thanks  though."
"Good quality feel. Realistic food that can be used for a number of items such as kitchen play, shopping or feeding dolls. Hard warning toys that look to be designed for many years of play. I love that this also encourages memory skills with the hiding colours and matching skills."
"I did not finish reading the book. Would love to get another book from kindle library but can't till I submit a sixteen word opinion."
"If you are looking for life answers as it relates to God's Word this book is for you! I think every Sunday School teacher and minister should buy this book."
"This is truly a wonderful game fashioned after the classic Super NES games of the same genre. I commend the programmers for taking the effort to create this mini masterpiece.Someone even took the time to write a mini-walkthrough (highlighting only the basics, but I'm sure there is an update in the works)I only have one question: Got any more?Answer: Of course they do! So far as I have seen, all of Kotobuki Solutions' products are more than worth the pittance they charge."
"I thought this was an e-book when I first saw it, but it's just a link to an online textbook. I'm interested in Java programming, but I don,thave the access for long-term use of this product."
"Stylish and sleek, looks great with the topaz shine! I would definitely get this is a supplemental product because the band that it comes with is pretty sporty. This band allows you to wear the shine with a nicer outfit (i.e. out to dinner or a party)"
"I love these! I had previously bought just the silver belly button from a different location for ten dollars and the diamonds have fallen out. I saw this amazing deal and when they arrived they were beautiful! These look even prettier in person and they fit perfectly. I definitely recommend!"
"Bueno el Producto, solo que es dif&amp;iacute;cil Rastrear el Producto, aunque me costo lo mismo el Envi&amp;oacute; y el Producto Vale la Pena,  Claro el Producto no era para mi era para mi hija."
"Excelente estos productos , mi hija se a divertido esta navidad mucho con ella y ahora veremos cual mas le compraremos por este mismo medio"
"This is an attractive keyboard cover that fits very well and protects the keys as well as expected.  The problem is that the top row of keys - the half-height function keys - are mislabeled.  I don't use those keys very often so it's not a huge problem for me but that seems to be a very significant flaw in a keyboard cover."
"Surprisingly Great tasting and quite filling."
"Does what it says"
"I have been taking this for a month now and I have noticed a significant change in my appetite patterns after starting to take 2 pills daily. Also energy levels have increased. So far so good."
"I'm happy with this purchase. The coconut oil is very light, and not very dense and greasy as other brands. Also the smell is very subtle. My problem with other coconut oils were the smell was too strong.So yea this is good for both cooking or personal use on the body."
"One of the best small analog synths out there. Arturia really have pushed the envelope here both in terms of functionality as well as value."
"Yes came in good quality and unused. So far the battery has lasted a long time. I'd buy definitely buy more!"
"If you are or are not confident in your job search Work with Recruiters Effectively is the book for you!"
"Like others have said - after about 2 months of use, the fabric has started to peel off. Not worth the money, I already need to buy a new case."
"This is a wonderful true story, authentically told from the heart. It is the personal story of the author, that inspires deep thinking on the consequences and reprecussions of war, particularly the Vietnam war."
"If you enjoy downton abbey or fictional historical stories you will relish this book which gives an insight into how the Great War affected families and society. A fantastic story you will not be able to put this book down."
"I saw this movie in theaters, and when I saw this film I didn't know anything about this movie other then that James Franco is in it.Now I think that James Franco is a great actor, but this movie without a doubt knocked him down a peg in my opinion. The movie starts with a horrible story and 5 characters that you can't help but hate. They all complain and they are just irritating and are the kind of people that make me give up on people today. This movie constantly repeats the same thing through the movie. For example they will say something and they will immediately replay it over and over another 2 or 3 times for God knows why, but I know it's incredibly irritating. This movie constantly repeats James Franco's incredibly stupid saying Spring Break, Spring break, Spring break Forever. And this is said more times then the number of times you wish the movie would end. There are not enough words to describe how much I hate this movie. I just don't get how some people enjoyed this. And I'm not bashing it because I have high movie standards. I have seen many bad but enjoyable movies, however Spring Breakers is not enjoyable in any way. It is so bad I am stunned I didn't walk out of this movie. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through this what felt like a forever long movie and thought something would happen that would redeem it. But nothing happened the ending is just as bad as the rest of this damn movie. And it ends with them repeating the same thing they do throughout the entire movie. I believe it is my destiny to warn people about this movie and save them the 94 minutes of there life that I will sadly never get back. Giving this movie one star is being to generous and it sickens me to give it that."
"I really enjoy the cake pan i like that it doesnt stick to the pan. The only negative thing about the pan that i didnt like was my cakes came out really big if you want a smaller round cake i suggest using a little battee in the pan."
"This book was a travel adventure without ever leaving the sofa.  So many things that make a book a good read are in this one.  Travel, adventure, history, whimsy, biographical, bit of comedy.  I have been to many of the places covered in this book and really enjoyed the revisit.  Definitely looking forward to the next adventure!!!!"
"I had been trying to find this book for ages! No where in town does anyone carry it, so I was very please not only to have found it for a great price but also for it to have been shipped on time! I really appreciate that :D"
"I ordered these and they never grew...I did everything I was told...but nothing grew :( I had seriously looked forward to growing these in our garden but somethings just aren't meant to be i suppose."
"I love this, one because of the price and two how well it seems to work. My only problems is that the buttons aren't like those on BMW main manufacture key fobs. They tend to stick a little bit...but all in all I am happy with it =)"
"I bought the case for a friend, as this was her first touch screen phone...and as she's like me in a few ways...she drops her phone quite often. It arrived either the day of the estimated delivery date...or the next day...either way it got there in less than a week, which is awesome, because I was told it would be a weeks time when I ordered a product and it didn't show for months. Over all we're very happy with the case :) We chose this one in particular because it came with a screen protector,,,now I just wish I could find one for me phone! :)"
"The package was delivered quickly with Amazon Prime, and the scarf is beautiful! It is so warm, and the color is gorgeous!! If I had the money (and the need for several more scarves) I would definitely purchase more of this kind. Alas, I already have an abundance, but I will keep this provider in mind!"
"Not spectacular enough to look through more than once or twice. High priced for what we got. Cute pictures though."
"I am thrilled I discovered these.There is no caomparison to the &amp;#34;others&amp;#34; that call themselves healthy bars.All flavors are wonderful."
"I had never tried a Mally product before because everything is way to pricey.I bought this and itis no better than a $10 primer I have."
"We have ordered 3 inexpensive phone cases from Amazon. None of them have fit. Pay more and maybe you'll get a better quality."
"Delivery was excellent.  Item was as expected.  What more can I really say. My grandson really loves this. Very good value. Glad I found this and purchased it."
"This book - this series - I can't even put into words how much I enjoyed reading it. Throughout the entire trilogy, there was never a moment that I considered abandoning it. Never a moment where I rolled my eyes because it was 'cheesy' or obvious. The author did a great job keeping the story interesting and 'even' - the final book, Crashed, seemed to have the most activity, but it flowed with the previous two books flawlessly. Of all the series &amp; trilogies I have read, I have to say the Driven Trilogy is my absolute favorite. Read it. Seriously. Five stars all the way!!"
"One of the best anime movies ever and miles ahead of its time. Truly groundbreaking and enjoyable even after all these years."
"Lovely fluorescent green liquid, delicious and worthy of a Shogun of Japan during the warring states era. Thanks Rishi tea!"
"I bought this for my boyfriend. First it arrived late in a cheap box with nothing but a very small plastic brush. It shows on the box that you can use it wet or dry. The first time he used it dry he got small pimples all over his neck and face. The second time he used it wet he got a huge rash on his face. He opened it to clean it out and all the pieces fell out. This is a horrible product and not worth the money I spent. I am so disappointed in this product. I wish I was able to return it and get my money back. I have now learned my lesson on buying these items online. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Very cheap product."
"Private arrangement is my favorite Brenda Jackson book yet.  I read this book in a few hours because I could not put it down(maybe because I want to live the life I read about).  Great job and great ending"
"We were given some Charlie's Soap Laundry Powder as a gift and fell in love... it'd the only laundry soap for us!"
"I give it t stars. Product was exactly what I was hoping for. The end result using these micro links was amazing."
"I absolutely love this game! I went thru levels in a breeze but uhh now I'm stuck but keep goin back to it."
"The variety of slots and games are awesome. Ghostbusters is the most awesome slot game ever. I will enjoy playing these games everyday."
"I loved dirty laundry... I read it in hours, I couldn't stop til I was finish.... Can't for part 2 to come out"
"I absolutely loved this book. The detailed description of how a D/s relationship should the entire submissive training was amazing. The chemistry between Brie and all her Doms had been electrifying. But her instinct calls and she always follows, Sir and Brie's encounters were always a fascinating area. Her inner struggle whom she belongs, the ending, the entire inner monologue was very gripping. Also what I enjoyed was the D/s jokes Lea would always crack up with. I learnt alot about D/s relations and how a Sub is made to act through this book to a very excruciating detail. Love it. Job well done Red Phoenix."
"Series which seems to have really good intricate details with quite a bit plot, even has few laughs as the series progress!! so far loving it!"
"the first book took me by surprise and it really had alot to offer in the story and also the romance part.The second book had little less of plotline and more of the romance part. Could have done better in both sections together.I am guessing there is a third addition to this series, and hoping she would pick up on the plot better.But overall good one read book."
"Great sound. Comfortable. Discreet. I am happy with the quality. I charged every three days for 30 minutes great performance"
"The mat is OK, but is just a flimsy piece of paper, not real mat board, and certainly not worth the $10 plus $5 S&amp;H I paid for it, but for some reason no stores in my area were carrying these types of mats at grad time, so I was stuck buying one on line."
"Kept me ok on my toes the whole time. Sex scene not as hot ad I would have wanted the knob though. But the store was still full of spice!"
"The product was better then I was expecting to receive, being a halloween costume. The tiara and skirt light up beautifully, the skirt wasn't shorter then shown. I also received the product on time and in perfect condition. I am very pleased with my purchase."
"This Muffin pan is Very good. It arrived in time and all the muffins come out nicely. they did not stick at all"
"love this series is as good as the first season. lots of action and twists need to watch it if you enjoyed first season"
"i gave it 4 start because series is still very good but starting to get confusing. Also dont really like olivia with the dark hair looks like a wig"
"I really enjoyed this series the actors are good. If you enjoy super natural things you will really enjoy this"
"This case does not fit the Droid.  I have to remove the case every time I want to charge my phone because the holes do not line up.  This was a total waste of money!"
"This case looks exactly like it does online.  It's pretty and fits perfectly.  The only downside is that the case doesn't cover the screen."
"Constantly entertaining. Plus everything with Kristen Bell is phenomenal. That's all I really wanted to say but I needed more words."
"Sweater runs smaller than sizing chart advises. I am a size 14/16 and i would have bought an XL based on the sizing chart. However, they were out of that size, so I ordered a 2XL, thinking it would be kind of nice to have a roomier fit, since I planned to wear this over leggings. Not so much. The 2XL is VERY tight, although that sizing is suppose to fit an 18/20."
"Although I saw the enevitable end, twists inthe plot were very entertaining asthe characters developed the story.Good read. Try it"
"Great product. Cheap, effective, sleek, and accurate. Works well with small items such as envelopes, some food and tobacco, etc."
"Always have bought these bottles for cycling. Love them. The water stays cool and the nozzle is great. Buy it! A cheap investment that's so worth it. They'll last you forever."
"This case is way more than I expected. I love it. It's made with quality. It's my first Ibera product and definitely not my last. The case is perfect. It doesn't shake, it is sealed, you can use the touch screen with ease, and it is strong. The case looks rad too. Buy it! You won't be disappointed."
"I love this thing for running. I love how it fits over the iphone 4 perfectly and you can tap the screen through the cover. It's at a great price for what you get."
"lovers of the characters will love the game.  play it with my kids who love the cartoon. levels are awesom."
"WAY TOO BIG! unless you want to pay more to get links removed from this watch, don't buy it. Yes, it is cute, and fairly cheap, but i am NOT going to pay more money to get it fixed."
"This came in so fast to the US. The case is very easy to get on and off. The colors are the exact same color in the picture. It is very protective case and it is so cute. It is my favorite so far and I have gotten so many complements on this case."
"I was introduced to Mokha Origin coffee two months ago, when the company's founder offered me a cup--with neither sugar nor cream. At first, I was hesitant to try this, or any, coffee black. But after that first sip, I understood why he had insisted I take it plain; this coffee was too good to have its perfect balance of rich aroma and delicate notes corrupted by saccharine or dairy additions. Mokha Origin is coffee to be enjoyed, not endured for the sake of caffeine delivery. It is an experience, and one that I look forward to indulging in again and again."
"It was a while back when I read the first few chapters of 'Hush'; and have been itching to get back to it. But life came in the way. And after almost ten years finally finishing one of the best works in comic books' history was the best holiday gift I could have gifted to myself."
"Such a great read :) I heard you were writing another one, I cant wait for it :) :) :)"
"Beats Wireless have great sound quality. On top of that they are very light and thus great to use in the gym/outdoors etc.They seem a bit less durable than what I would expect for this price but other from that they're great."
"I love this it works perfectly and actaully has a good sound quality to it and its super static like past one's I have bought. I gave this 4 stars though because the remote doesnt work but maybe that because I have a ipod, who knows."
"I thought this was going to be a average smaller purse but its not its small, its tiny. It's the size of a 5 year olds play purse."
"I thought this book was like new but it's awesome. No marks or pencil on it. Fast shiping. High recommend!"
"I have  been fascinated with the the Pretty Little Liars show , the  book I  just magnificent. It's absolutely perfecto. You should give it a go:)"
"This app sucks. Do not buy it, it's not worth almost $3. It's constantly freezing. Also you can't return it. This sucks. Don't I repeat don't buy tho  stupid app. Ugh."
"Just started game so, really don't have much to say yet but, so far I like it. I think it's a really cute game to play for all ages. :-)"
"I've been playing this game for about a month now and had no problems and as soon as the new update for Valentine's day comes in it stops working. It loads then pulls it up and goes right back to the loading screen over and over again. This problem really needs to be fixed. It was my favorite game. :("
"This is the first book I've ever read by Jay Bell.  It won't be my last.His command of language, his ability to write beautiful prose, is inspiring.  I found myself going back and retreading passages.  Committing lines to memory.  Highlighting phrases I want to revisit.If you love good writing or want to be inspired to write, read this book.  The characters are people you'll want to know better.The only regret I have, is that it's done."
"This collection of authors truly did run the gamut of stories and relationships... Some just beginning and others ending.  A fantasy and others too real with pain evident through the dialogue alone.  Definitely a must read for young people who are struggling to find their way in a world that may seem cruel at times."
"This was a rich story full of love, pain, loss, new beginnings and characters who made my heart swell with emotion.  Seeing the love between Ben and Tim grow was a joy and I loved the way Jason gained a family.  Jay Bell proved that family is where your heart feels at home."
"This is a great coming-of-age story with Sam learning who to trust and who is genuine.  I love the way Perie Wolford writes and the sarcasm he tosses in!  Exactly as a teenager would do.  I'm impatiently awaiting his next books in the series."
"The humor throughout is great.  The characters are fun to read about.  Just enough character development to make them interesting.  Wonderful storyline. Can't wait to read the rest in the series."
"Interspersing history with acting and love is a refreshing change for a contemporary novel.  The 'hotness' of the three actors heightens the enjoyment!"
"If the story were longer with the characters fleshed out more, it would have the potential to be a better story.  The writing came across a little stiff and mechanical, much like the characters, come to think of it."
"These guys were so lucky to find each other, even though a cougar tried to destroy their relationship before it had a chance to get started.  Definitely a HEA!"
"Jase does his best to free Mark to love someone else, but even being half a world away, Mark never let's him go.  DADT is gone, and good riddance!"
"The title caught my attention... I thought it was going to be a m&amp;eacute;nage... But it was so much better!  I loved Patricks's and Vin's characters.  Now I need to go back and read 'The Square Peg' to see how Shane and Ben met.  I'm thinking their story is going to be hot!"
"This is a cute story of two regular guys who correct some misperceptions and fall in love.  At first I thought it was going to be a twist on 'The Gift of the Magi' but it turned out even better!"
"This is the first book I've read by Cardeno C. But definitely won't be the last.  The plot grabs your interest from the beginning, the characters are flawed but intriguing and lovable.  Since C.C. Has written several books, I'm looking forward to many hours of pleasure ahead."

"This is an excellent book for anyone that is looking to achieve and success in life. I absolutely recommend this book"
"This Book Unwinds Itself Like No Other Book I've Ever Read... It At First Is A Little confusing but Then It Gets A Little Better To Understand.. It Ends Up Being A Really Good Book"
"This Is A Fun Activity to Do With A Family Member But It's A lot Smaller Than The Package Makes It Look Like..."
"Arrived on time and perfectly matched my wife breast pump. I was afraid it wasn't going to feet but it did. Includes 2 diaphragms each with two stems."
"I liked very much the presentation of this product. The protective film is not easy to install but the instructive video on youtube is very handy. When just aplyed it gives a kind of microgranular texture to the display but this dissapears in the next days. I do have, however, one negative oppinion. Since I ordered the full body protective skin, there are several films to aply but not enough instalation solution. Just one small cilinder spray is included. My advise: when buying the full skin please include at least 2 or 3 cilinders of installation solution."
"Unfortunately it does not fully protect the phone should it drop. It is flush with the phone instead of being higher all around."
"I like to wear vintage shirts because they make me look thinner. I also like the way the material shines"
"It's fast, portable and worth it!I use it as a backup for the documents i use between my home pc and the one i use at work. Very easy to use (plug and play).I recomend it for anyone who has to work in more than 1 pc."
"I bought this for my mom , she is a pizza cook.. She loves to make pizza in her home and needed a new pan so I decided to buy a cast iron one. Seems like when something is cooked in cast iron it sure taste better."
"I'm a first timer here at amazon and i took the chance to order this camera cause i've ben wanting this and finally i have something to call my own.. im super in love with it.. well not just me but my boyfriend and the family :) i actually got super excited when i got them with the film.. I know film is kinda pricey but its worth it! I just use mines for special occasion or to take a picture for the kids, even them they liked.. i don't see any problem with it so far.."
"A great in depth view of the game.  Teaches you how to only pay hands with a high equity return."
"The plastic screen had a long scratch across the front. The rubber around the case is very flimsy but you get what you pay for. I probably would not buy this type of unit again. I did not return it because returning would cost more than the case"
"This is one of the better shows on tv.  The range of characters and the story pulls the viewer in and takes them on a ride through the home town of a marshal.  Quite a bit of violence, drama, and sarcastic humor.  If you like Sons of Anarchy, you will like this."
"Very short skirt!!  Use a Pettiskirt extension to help with the length.  It is polyester so it is not great quality but it is a very nice costume.  Make sure you get the matching wig."
"I did some searching as far as benchmarks.  This was one of the highest ranked AMD processors.  There were some higher ranged Intel ones so I looking into them first.  The prices were way more than what I was willing to spend.  I ordered this along with a Thermaltake Water 2.0 PRO/All In One Liquid Cooling System CLW0216.  Placed it on a AM3+ board, fired it up and nothing... Windows 7 would not boot.  I installed a new copy of Windows 7 and it worked perfectly.  I used Handbreak to compare my before and after.  My previous system, a 2500MHz AM2+ system, would do about 132 fps.  Now I get 315 fps.  For the effort/price, this was a great purchase."
"The case is thin and does not add too much bulk to the phone.  It does not cover the top nor the bottom of the phone.  There is no cover for the glass either.  It does provide a very nice holster.  When the phone is not in the holster, the holster is hardly noticeable. It does offer a kickstand that is not even apparent unless you are looking for it.  I have not used this feature but the design of it is very impressive."
"I just bought this last week for use in my son's graduation for use on my X-T1.  I was able to sit about 5 ft from people and get a clear zoom on their faces without any shake.  For shots about 50 yards away, I was able to get full body shots.  The colors came out very clear.  The lens is heavy but after getting use to it, it was not an issue."
"Really good sound for the price.  Easy to carry.  Will order another one shortly for my own use.  Nice package."
"This is a helpful book which shows the contrast between the Isa the messiah of Islam and Jesus of Nazareth.  You may be surprised to see the similarities initially, but as the book progresses, you will see that they are two very different people who cannot be reconciled.  One is a man who never died and was not God the Son.  The other is God the Son, who died on the cross for our sins.  These are helpful concepts."
"The author relates many examples of persons who came to Christ from Islam through visions or dreams or healing.  I had a recent opportunity to interview a woman from Ivory Coast with precisely this type of situation coming out of folk Islam to Christian faith."
"Against the backdrop of the turbulence in Europe in the early 20th century, the author traces the struggles of her family through two world wars.  God's providence is abundantly demonstrated."
"It is small, light, portable, and a snap to put up.  It is sturdy enough and roomy enough for my 17 inch laptop as well as a projector.  I use it regularly in my classrooms.Robert PattonProfessor of MissionsCrown College of the Bible"
"This compact hub is neat and functions well.  I have been pleased with its performance.  It is immediately sensed; no problems with its use.Robert Patton"
"I have been pleased thus far with this small unit.  I make broadcasts and podcasts, and am not involved in complicated setups, but this unit uses little space, gives an adequate boost to my microphone, and has virtually no humming or buzzing.  It is well worth the cost.Robert Patton"
"I am so impressed by this text that I am using it as a part of a graduate course I am teaching on the Personal Development of the Missionary.  The principles are scriptural and timeless."
"The author provides a number of very practical hints as to becoming a true friend to Muslims in your local area in the USA.  She mentions many &amp;#34;does and don'ts&amp;#34;, some of which were new to me.  Her use of scriptures as outlined in the later chapters was also helpful.&amp;#34;"
"I'm not a fan of T-fal but this pizza nonstick pan works good, it lets air through and cooks pizzas from small to large well without putting them on a rack or stone. I prefer this over a stone."
"I use this to change oil and for any other job up to 3/4. This is my second one, the first one is still working in service and now this newer one will be used for another vehicle. Great to have in your vehicle for emergencies."
"I like it for the kitchen sink just to use for small stuff or making tea etc... Other than that its just a plain one or two filter media.but culligan so far is better than some of its competitors at use vs price. You can get water testing supplies and test your results to see over time how they perform."
"I would suggest another brand. First thing is the plastic itself is not clear to begin with, poor design or Quality control.Used multiple times but still got either bubbles or not very good contact between the two pieces."
"It's ok in the sense i hope the antibacterial properties are actually working, as far as cleaning linoleum floors it leaves much to desire."
"Good tasting chewing gun that lasts a good while, but be warned this gum will become one of the most stickiest gum to get off your fingers once completed."
"Used in a hyundai sonata 2012 and work well with the factory projector lamps to make an almost HID appearance and keep brightness to see ahead. The filiment alignment and glass tinting done by PIAA are way better than the cheaper china $25 ones by FAR!!"
"Very good company that makes carabiners. I use this mostly as a keychain organizer but if needed it works great at holding me with room to spare."
"Made of nice thick solid metal and nice welds and overall appearance and function. Works well in what i'm using it for which is hanging a somewhat heavy metal birdfeeder."
"This light is way brighter than the old maglight 3 cell. Pop in some duracells and this baby will stay good in your vehicle for a long time. I would not waste time in finding a led bulb to place in old mag, i would buy this with the real led made for it."
"I can remember when i was younger watching this, now that i'm older the whole family enjoys this story about the times during slavery and one families history during it all. Great actor casts and worth having in collection."
"Good little frame for the price on Amazon, and has the option on back for sitting on a desk or hanging."
"These things are awesome! Good tasting chocolate cherries that seem to come out only around christmas time. My mom loves them"
"Dial white tea smells sooooo goood! and the foaming action makes it great for kids or adults to want to use when washing hands. Doesn't dry out hands or effect the skin."
"Pretty good peanuts, not too salty and not too oily. Overall a somewhat hard crunchy peanut that has a unique flavor and roast to it."
"These hepa filters work great for kenmore vacuum we have. They were a good price here on Amazon and we replace them regularly due to allergies."
"Very good tire and rim cleaner. It cleans tires and rims with hardly any scrubbing, none if reasonably light dust. For years i used a dollar store cleaner made by quick stuff inc but that was discontinued as company went OOB. This is good if you can get Eagle One AtoZ at a good price, this is the only cleaner by eagle one I like or would use. Have used it on chrome and aluminum rims with no issues of acidity or tire markings."
"Works great with killing my vampire keurig coffee maker. I found out using the belkin monitor that it was using some watts even though powered off. this helps."
"My little dog loves this bed, but i put an electric warming pad underneath inside of this bed &amp;#34;it has a zipper to take cover off foam to wash&amp;#34;. She gets warm and toasty and for a dog over 95 in human years she deserves pampering."
"A gift for my niece who loves horses. You can tell up close it is made of resin but is a well done resin as far as the relief of carving. Holds a fair amount of rings or necklaces etc."
"Got these for my nephew to play with as I have introduced him to many 80s cartoons. His favorite being transformers but he seems to like thundercats and interested. This sword extends, makes comments and lights up and has a on and off switch on end to save battery life. The guards flip out with a push of button which makes it cool, so far it has stood up to us sword playing."
"Like the group coldplay and most of their music. This album was very good and many choices to listen too for the money."
"Used it to fill a tahoe and a small car, both works well and the pump doesn't even drag at all. Nicely built pump compressor, recommend this over the cheaper plastic ones."
"It's recycled so that is great, the pens last a long time and really good to write with. Not sure if ink is recycled but its an overall good pen."
"Whoever made this did a real good job on it! Very nicely finished, and makes a great little conversation piece."
"I used this as a lazy mans christmas tree light on and off switch:) We use led lights on tree and the remote worked great when we wanted the lights on or off."
"Not a real fan of Rihanna, but she does have a few hits or songs i like. This song with Mikky Ekko is really nice and has a good beat or rhythm to it. She sings very well on this."
"Is ok and has good smell to it. Keeps skin somewhat hydrated, not sure yet on the sea minerals in it and its effects but will keep using and see how it goes. I like Dove for bodywash that or irish spring and dial gold"
"These gloves fit good and allow you to use your phone with them on. Made of fleece it keeps your hands ok warm, i prefer warmer but these are just normal gloves."
"Have had this for months in use even through the past cold winter misery we had in the south and still works. Takes good pictures and battery life is longer than that of some other brands. I wrote to moultrie because of worry of cold temps and operation range and the info they gave me said it would work and it did, the rayovac batteries i had in it didn't die as well! overall for low budget this worked good."
"Beautiful track and sound, this woman has a unique voice or sound to her when recording tracks. The music video online is pretty neat as well."
"This cable works very nicely and transfers with no issues, the long length is good for making runs or just to use at home."
"This might be good for stadium but too large for a chair use, when mine arrived it had a terrible odor coming from it like plastics or spoiled water although checking it did not show signs of previous ownage or damages. I think it comes that way from factory. The memory foam in it &amp;#34;if any&amp;#34; is less than 1/8th of an inch the rest is stiff foam."
"I like it, easy to install and each has 100watt bulbs you can direct in three directions. Only thing that is kind of annoying is the foam gasket that suppose to help against the wall. I think they should have made that into the part itself to begin with, but hey its made in China. Overall finish is nice and metal, will hold up good. Sensor is adjustable from the outside which is nice as some other lights you have to adjust from the inside."
"Easy to connect and setup, it works well for a electronic doorbell. The range we have it is about 4 feet so long distances i'm not sure about. Has many tunes to choose from which would come in handy on holidays etc. For the price it's not too bad."
"Very comfortable plushy pillow, when it arrived it contained some letter and business card from the company about who they are and what they believe their product should be, which in my book is a really good thing to do. States is veteran owned which is a plus and made in the u.s.a. another plus. The only thing i wish it had was a zipper on it so i could take just a little of the stuffing out, i like a flat pillow."
"Works good, simple design and easily fits in a backpack or portable container. It comes in a bag with all the needed supplies."
"Its okay for budget scratchers but these are plain bamboo ones with a somewhat fast finish on it. They are not that thick also. but you pay for what you get."
"These dishes are beautiful and have a feel that is elegant and contemporary.  They were a gift for my daughter."
"This was my first used cartridge to order.  My friend had one Icold borrow but I wanted my own.  It worked great."
"Sunspot by Lane Labs Works great.  I was so glad to find it. We have used it for several years."
"THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL.  IT HAS A WINTERGREEN SMILL THAT DISIPATES SOON.  IT RELIEVED MY HUSBANDS PAINFUL HANDS AND HIS SHOULDER THAT HAS BEEN BOTHERING HIM FOR MONTHS."
"This cartridge is really cool.  The graphic designs can be adapted to many applications. I can't wait to go scrapbooking again."
"These shoes are light weight and comfortable.  The heel is just right.  My feet don't hurt when I wear these."
"I just got this watch, it has a good finish and comes in a red box, the silicone strap feels soft and comfortable, good details and for the money I recommend anyone looking for a everyday watch to buy this product."
"only faulty thing is the bracket, it is realllyyyyyy hard to take off the watch besides that i liked it."
"I sure am glad i bought this game! :-) It's a great game, that puts your thinking skills to the test"
"These are perfect, idk how to install them but i made it work. Its a outstanding fit and quality product, it will speed up flash rate but if that bothers u get resistors and it will go back to normal, get these awesome signals they completely change the look of ur bike"
"This bracket with an eliminator kit gives u the Clean look, tail end looks amazing, easy install, quality material and design perfect fit, excellent product u wont be disappointed!"
"I have 7 other original plates.  This newer one blends in with older set that I have had for years."
"Good energy product for cycling, it saves a lot of space, you can carry them in your pocket, its great."
"I CANNOT believe that Amazon would carry such a USELESS piece of 'literature'!  What good does a summary of this book do to inform interested readers?  As far as summaries go, this is by far the WORST I have ever come across.  Amazon should do more for its customers and remove this piece of garbage ASAP.  VERY UNSATISFIED!!!"
"The spot where the pearls connect to the lace is shotty at best.  Purchased for my wife and she said it was a nice try, but for the most part she thought it was more of a novelty.  She on the way to our dinner date and shifted in the car just a bit and the pearls broke off from the lace."
"This movie has a interesting story, it also came in a great condition, no scratches at all, I really enjoyed to watch this movie. I advice this movie for all in age of 15+"
"It was a watered down version of what I usually get! Very disappointed after paying $200!!I won't be buying this product again."
"I inhaled this book! The plot was riveting and the ending was as it should be. Well done! I may be biased because I grew up in Spencerport as did the author, and loved the references to it and the surrounding Rochester area. That being said, this is the kind of book that you don't want to end, and immediately think &amp;#34;this would make an awesome movie&amp;#34; as soon as it's finished. Thank you David for writing such a riveting and thoroughly enjoyable book. I will be sharing it with my family!"
"perfect fit for galaxy note,  but when heated from sun it became so loose and you can not adjust it to the angle you want."
"Purchased this case for my son, great case, heavy duty and cheap. Will reorder in the future.Cases are way cheaper than store purchase"
"I lost a palmtree necklace, tried to find a store to replace it to no avail.I wanted something  dainty and with good quality.I was hesitant but I  am so pleased! I get a ton of compliments.It's perfect. I wear it every day."
"Je suis tres satisfait de mon subwoofer , livraison rapide et de qualit&amp;eacute; et un bon service de votre part, merci!"
"I purchased this case for my wife's new evo 4 3d. I wanted to make sure the front glass and the two camera lenses on the back were protected, and what better way to do that than with an otter box:) not to big and bulky, and it does the job"
"Love the protecters they are wondeful they really do wonder having a lil one that loves to play with my new phone with sticky fingers! Love it"
"Broke the second day I bought it it was so cute n I was super excited to use it but it broke I was upset!aa"
"Fantastic show! Hard and sometimes uncomfortable, it truly shows the painAnd agony of addiction.I would recommend this show!"
"I originally had four of the under the counter lights but soon found out that they are so handy I purchased two more.  I have to admit that none of mine are ""under the counter"".  I have them just inside my closets and the utility room that is usually quite dark.  I have two that I place around the house by setting them on dressers, end tables, or anywhere I may need them when I get up very early in the morning or anytime at night.  I sometime use one as a very handy flashlight when I enter a dark room.  I have been very pleased with the ease of purchase, the ease of installation, customer service, and how long they last.  For a small light they put out a tremendous amount of bright light."
"I ordered this on a rush for an expo that I decided to do at the last minute.  It arrived quickly and was absolutely perfect for the expo.  The only way it could have been better is if I had laundered out the fold lines and silk screened my logo on the front.  Plenty of time to do that before the next one."
"it was a little short for my taste but otherwise the dress was just fine, I ended up giving it to my niece"
"I'm a medium &amp; did run too small, should've purchased a large. But I did like the material, will be exchanging."
"Liked the case but broke too easy when removing my phone. Not sure if I'd purchase this one again. Would have loved other than that."
"The book was delivered earlier than I expected and was brand new. The price is very cheap compare to other websites or the bookstores. I will recommend this book to all students because it is a real bargain and the book has interesting topics and studies helpful for teachers."
"I love this game! I thought at first that it would be much like it's sister game ""Diner Dash"", which I also like, but Wedding Dash not only has the character Flo from Diner Dash, and the similarities of having to bring guests their meals quickly, but also the bonuses of getting different guests with their own personalities and preferences. Though this adds its own extra challenges to the levels, which increase in difficulty as you go on, it also personally makes the game more interesting and enjoyable! I've spent many an hour attempting to not only reach the goals needed to pass each level, but also to pass the ""expert"" goal. The free trial gives free levels in one venue, while additional payments unlock different wedding venues. Very addicting and fun game."
"Started out good, but the ending wasn't. It had a lot of twists and turns and I wasn't sure who was the good guy and then I figured it out. I felt like it wasn't really finished."
"had this several years ago and it got away from me. glad to have it again and enjoying it."
"bigger than i expected but will keep it anyway."
"I love the Grinch and these characters are great for the Grinch Village! The quality is amazing. The spring that comes from the toy musical box really springs so character has a lot of animation. The people are very detailed and look just like the orignial Grinch!"
"Great read. Definitely worth the time. I didn't know much about the trial and so the details of it were fascinating."
"Lives up to its description. Settings are a little confusing for a first time user. Other than that I liked it."
"Best brand for the money. Bulb has a nice OEM color and works perfectly. Beats paying $100.00 for a brand new one through Nissan."
"Got my Toshiba television. Took it out of the box and it looked great. Nice style and design. Plugged it in and powered it on. I see the Toshiba logo as its powering on, then I see a black screen. Took a little closer look and I could see the shadow of the menu box. Tinkered with it for a while and finally got fed up. Called Toshiba. Great customer service. Pretty much told me this happens often and its a hardware problem with the screen. Yet to get my replacement from amazon. Maybe that will change my mind."
"I found that the metal piece that goes through the holes on the band is too small and does not stay in place. Unfortunately I will be returning my purchase and sad to say I will not order a replacement as I'm afraid they are all made this way."
"The Kindle Fire was exactly what I wanted. Books, movies, TV, even check Facebook. I don't know why I waited so long to get one!"
"the bigger ones worked better but the small ones were very soft and bent easily  didn't work well with my dead blow hammer"
"The item only fits on my original full size not my kimber or my rock island I had to make major modifications toget it to fit the gun I bought it for and I'm still not completely satisfied withhow it fits after working it over"
"i bought this in hopes that it would be comparable to the original beauty blender (which i have purchased before) and i was extremely disappointed. it doesnt get soft when wet and it makes blending in concealer and foundation very hard and doesn't blend out evenly. I'm very irritated that i waited 3 weeks for this to get delivered and end up regretting it so much"
"Quaker Brown Sugar Breakfast Bars are the perfect snack, quick breakfast or late night craving.  The bars are seasoned to perfection. Everyone in my family loves them.  I have noticed the Oatmeal to go bars disappearing from every major grocery store shelf. Every time I would change grocery stores they were being discontinued. It was so frustrating!  Thanks to Amazon and the ease of ordering, I will never have to worry about it again. Thanks Amazon! Another happy customer.A.MillerTexas"
"got this as a free app for the day and I certainly appreciate the way the narrator narrates the story."
"This is a great quality product. The neodymium tweeters are crisp and provide a stunning frequency range. The blue LED display gives my car that futuristic vibe that I've been going for, too. This is a high end product with a low end price.  You get the sound AND the look, and, really, what more do you need?"
"In my opinion Mag lights of any model are the best flash lights made. I was a police officer for 17 years and recharable Mag lights were all we used. I carried a mini mag on my duty belt for back up, It's very bright for such a small light, the adjutable beam  is great, standard with all Mag lights. It comes with a spare bulb in the end cap and Duracell batteries.Ready to go right out of the package. I priced the same light, including the holster, at Home Depot, they wanted $22. Just a great light for a great price."
"This is a really well made knife, for such a low price, you can't go wrong. It wears comfortably in my boot, has a well made leather sheath, with clip. It's perfect for what it's made for, self defense."
"this filter, as with Amazon, arrived on time, and works perfectly. I smoke, in one room of the house, and this filter totally gets rid of the smoke, therefore the smell, plus this is the best price I have found for this filter."
"I'm a big fan of Liam Neeson, and from what I saw on the preview, it will be every bit as action packed as Taken Part 1."
"not as much build up as I would have liked. things happened too quickly and are obvious. some tip comes in of imminent danger then instantly it's happening. book felt rushed."
"I will be completely honest... chapter 1 really lost me. I was not into the idea of a teenage love story, so I put the book away and decided not to read it. A few days later I saw a YouTube video of Teri telling her story about writing the book and where the story is headed. (YouTube link here [...] The video made me very curious, so I picked the book back up and dove right into chapter 2. From there I read chapters 2-14 without hardly breathing, I was so excited! I absolutely loved where the book went, and I am ecstatic anticipating the next books! Good job Teri!"
"I really loved the whole trilogy of Fifty Shades. I've read them over and over again. I would tell someone they should read the whole trilogy.  Thumbs up!!"
"Classic old movie, very funny and heart warming, it even made us cry when Joe died. Great family movie. A+"
"Classic old movie, very funny and great effects for the time. A bit of harsh language, but great family movie. A+"
"Classic old movie, very funny and heart warming, nothing you cant watch with a 7 yr old. Great family movie. A+"
"We had a great time playing this game - even our 7 yr old can play it - family fun."
"I really like the boot, and it fits fine, but when I received the boot in the mail it looked extremely olive. It was more of a green than a tan. I returned this boot for the whiskey color. Otherwise it is cute!"
"I love it. It isn't too strong it smells awesome. I reccomend it highly and i am very picky. I also like the fact it isn't over powering"
"It showed up cracked and it did not match the picture very much. Overall very disappointed. I would not recommend getting these. They look like dark glass. The cracks aren't even there really."
"arrived really quickly and it looks just adorable! It is exactly what I expected, I would highly recommend this for any hello kitty lovers"
"Its no Bull-Nox or Hemo Rage. It is a servicable, but not great pre-workout. i use it on days when i am doing lighter training so i dont get burned out on other better pre workouts."
"I think this book was well written and keeps you interested all the way through. I would recommend this book to all."
"Good book. Kept you interested. Did not get bored reading it and  was always anxious to get back to reading it."
"Cutsie movie. Fun to watch but not much of a plot. The actors did a pretty good job but the story line was lacking"
"Have always liked playing spider solitaire and its nice to know that you can still get it on the more modern machines. I like the way you can cjustomize it to fit you. aWould recommend this product to anyone who plays spider solitaire"
"Works awesome and is so easy to pack. Love the convenience of having books and movies at my fingertips!!Love the clarity."
"this movie did not keep me to interested but it was ok. Not as good as I  thought it would be."
"This game is ok. Do not like the graphics quite as much as alot of these types of games but it is fun to play. The graphics are good and ot works well"
"If it wasn't for the mini games there really wouldn't be much to this game. The only good thing is that you get 100.00 bonuses every so often so you can keep playing"
"This book was fast  to read. Nice simple story lines. Would read it again. Wasn't much of a surprise but a nice simple story."
"I chose this rating because it doesn't work quite as well on the kindle but still works pretty good and I really like having several fun games to play on one app. These games are a little better than a lot of the apps I have for the kindle."
"I usually buy my Lanza shampoo at the beauty shop-but decided to try it on line and somethings wrong with this shampoo-it does not lather up and it wont even go in my hair when washing my hair-it's in the same bottle that i get from my beauty shop-but whatever is inside the bottle is not the same stuff.  I love Amazon and I order all the time-but not happy with this bottle that I received from Mrs Goodeal's shampoo."
"great graphics.. loads fast. no problems until i unlocked the 4th level game. wont unlock even w wi-fi connection..  ??? otherwise, awesome game!!!"
"I had this about 2 years ago and came to amazon and found it its been a while so the gloss has a new application but i still love it i will be ordering more"
"I love this phone I have no problems with it. its a great phone and I love the keyboard ! great phone!"
"this tablet does not stay on and shuts off when it wants to I do like the way it looks but its not worth the money I spent"
"I'm one of those women who was blessed with the darkest, coarsest leg hair, which begins to stubble literally as soon as I finish shaving. The second I step out of the hot shower, I get goosebumps and might as well have not bothered shaving at all. So, I have been looking around at other hair removal methods for summertime, but have been intimidated by wax strips of other brands. My sister (who has sparse, blonde leg hair) uses the Sally Hansen strips, and not only does the later redness look painful (it usually lasts a full day), but she has to go back over her legs several times to get even half the hair off. I vowed to never even attempt those!So, I did some intense research before deciding on a product, and these Veet strips seemed to have great overall reviews. Despite my first impression of wax strips, I picked up a box of these yesterday to try. After a bit of stalling, I warmed up the first strip and got ready to wax! It didn't necessarily feel pleasant, but I would call it more of an annoying sting than pain. Keep in mind, this was my first time waxing my legs, so I was probably more sensitive than those who have waxed before. There was virtually no wax left on my legs (just a little where the bottom edge of the strip was placed), and the slight redness lasted less than an hour. I only had to use one clean-up pad per leg, and even that was mostly to see how well they worked (if they got the minimal leftover wax, if they burned at all, if they left my legs shiny like the ad boasted). The pads did leave my legs super smooth and shiny, but my only complaint is that the floral/clean fragrance of them wasn't amazing. It wasn't bad, it just reminded me of my grandmother's perfume. The good thing is that the smell is easily covered with scented lotion. Anyway, this wax kit definitely exceeded my expectations and was easy for a first-timer. I will try to update in the future about the long-term use of these."
"It's hard to hear thru the plastic I hate you can't fix regular ear plug thru the hold it's to big should be thinner and last hard to deal with"
"Purchased with Ontario 18 inch machete. Good sheath for fit and protection but scratches the heck out of the machete. Unless you plan on grinding off the rivet for the belt clip you will be disappointed."
"The watch look seven better in person. The horn strap is very nice and overall this watch is very classy. It face isn't too big either which was a slight concern when ordering."
"for those who love to race and want to spend just the necesaryextra confortable, stiff,great pro look:) great"
"Finally a diet and exercise book that recognises that one size doesn't fit all, and you have to use scientific method to figure out what works for you"

"these knifes are cheap and thin, they  dont fit in block well.The cut is good but hardware on outside not strong."
"Love it"
"It was okay, but reminded me of a very cheap version of the Griffin Survival case. I accidentally broke the case a couple days after I got it, trying to take it off. In the long run, it's better to just spent the extra 10-15 dollars on the griffin, or otterbox."
"It was a really awesome book and I can't wait to read the second one , called reached read this book"
"I chose this rating because it really was a great book. I would recommend it to girls around ten to twelve. It really gave an exciting twist from the actual fairy tale, and it was also more descriptive about the childhood of the prince and the princess and was a lot more descriptive over all."
"I can only say it is ok for me to use. We know this book is very old and I just need it for one year! If I need to value it, it can achieve between 2 and 3 stars"
"This book was not as good as past works in the Artemis Fowl series however it is still great read"
"This game is really fun! I really enjoyed it. I didn't want to stop playing. I would advisegetting this game. Draw a stick man epic!"
"1 They are a lot smaller than I expected. 2 I can buy these pillows at wal greens and big lots for 5 to 10 dollars. When I saw the commercial it looked like something never made before but its the same stuff they use in those cheap pillows at the drugstore. So I was a little disappointed but it's OK. The seller was great!!!! Everything I wrote about that was a problem was my own mistake the seller wrote the dimensions and I expected something without doing my own homework. I am saving her/him the seller and I will be doing business with her/him again"
"Ok, so I don't usually write reviews, but this album is worth my time. Unfortunately, this record is something you probably won't find in your local christian bookstore. It seems as if all the good stuff is independent these days.(Of course, this is only my opinion.) Why won't christian radio take notice of some of these incredible artists who only want to glorify God with their talents? Anyway, I have heard several cuts from Lara Landon's most current album, ""Overcome."" Beautiful voice. I'm glad she has decided to worship her Creator with it. The sound of that album is more contemporary. This album, in which she collaborated with Magellan is completely different. Completely!! And this is a good thing. The album starts out with a completely original take on the hymn ""Crown Him With Many Crowns."" For lack of a better word, this is fantastic. The beats are incredible, reminding me of 90's techno. The feel remains about the same throughout the duration of the album. And I must add that their version of ""Awesome God"" is probably my favorite. Don't get me wrong, this is a great worship song. It's just that I've heard so many ""lifeless"" versions.  There is even a small portion of a song that reminds me of a Pink Floyd song. (My pagan days) As I finish writing this I am listening to ""Glow.""  I probably won't add too much more. This album is refreshing and I can't wait to listen to it this summer with my windows down. (I'm sure I'll look really cool at 40!!) Anyway, buy this album and support these two gifted artists who only want to share the Gospel through Scripture, hymns, worshipful lyrics and music that will most assuredly make the Heavenly Host shake their wings off!!"
"I though they would sound ok but sound amazing very nice clear sound... all the lights work fine to have 4 in my 83 chavy caprice in a fiberglass back deck and they are amazing.... I WOULD PUT THEN NEXT TO THE BEST LIKE KICKER AND JL...."
"Outstanding. A must read. Book for anyone. Who wants to help. Others. And him or her self.very easy. To understand.  And. Put into. Practice.  Every one has this ability. So put to good use."
"Love it!!!!!!!"
"I first bought this movie for myself &amp; have watched it many times. Now I am giving it to my granddaughter for Christmas."
"To say that I was disappointed in this product is an understatement. I'm 5'4&amp;#34;, 140 pounds. I'm healthy but I do have curves. These boots would not zip up! I've never had a pair of boots even be tight on my calves before, but these were ridiculous. As soon as I can figure out how to return them form my money back, I will be doing that.Don't buy these unless your legs are VERY thin."
"This works perfectly for my logitech key board I bought with my ipad case. I would definitely recommend it again and recommend the seller to a friend!"
"no complants from me on my part. t seems to be doing the charge I wanted but it does not hold a charge as long as my old one  I phone 4. The I phone 5 batt. depleates very quickly for some reawson but im manageing ok"
"MY PARENTS LOVED THEM. ENJOYED THAT THEY COULD BE WORN ON HAND BUT ALSO WEAR AROUND THEIR NECK. BEAUTIFUL AND WORTH THE PRICE."
"Awesome! After watching the first part in the movie I read the book, and it was a shame that I watched it first! Great easy read."
"Watch beautiful! but you can see the scratches changed the battery!! I paid for a new one sent me a used!"
"I like it alot very goodworks good I like it very much for night typingI like it that you can charge it and use it at the same time"
"shouldn't expect much for this bargain price.  It will not win any costume prizes for sure, but might get your child's one big wish come true.  And thats because kids are easy to please"
"its a kids toy; yet it is quite delicate.  I expected more life for the price i paid.Maybe my son was too rough with it."
"This is very plush and high quality stuff.  While's its slightly pricey;its nothing compared to the new look your car gets.  And the wall to wall feeling inside is like you get in your living room.  highly recommended"
"I have been looking to replace my old, hightech ipad2 cover with a blue tooth wireless keyboard for quite some time now.  But didn't want to spend too much a second time.  This cover is not only extremely affordable but it is actually very smart and handy.  I highly recommend it to someone who is looking to get something under $10!"
"My son loves this.  instead of hours on the computer or iPad, my 5 year old literally spends hours coloring and creating new stuff.  i am so proud."
"My family all love cashew nuts. It almost seems impossible to find them without the salt. Thank you for giving such great options on all of your products. I can never run out , we enjoy it tremendously. It is a nice option from chips."
"I bought this screen as a replacement for my cracked screen ( I slammed the machine shut) I was somewhat hesitant because of the price, however since receiving and installing the screen Ive been very impressed by the quality and colour of the screen. I would recommend this screen to anyone needing to replace a crack macbook screen and who isnt afraid to DIY."
"this is a goos quality, matched description perfectly. good vinyl decal for way cheaper than any store. would def reccomend."

"the car now works fine, just I as expected, it fit perfectly and solve the starting problem and iddle issues"
"Great book you should read it it is a great story and I think that lots of other people would enjoy it."
"My daughter likes the jacket. However, the picture on the website showed a black jacket with hot pink on the sides. When the jacket arrived she was disappointed to see it was solid black. It is very soft &amp; cozy so she decided to keep it because she did not like the other color options. If it looked like the picture I would give it 5 stars."
"If you liked candy crush, you'll love this game even more. The best part is that it's free. I definitely do not regret downloading this app!"
"Ms Bouton journey is shared by millions of people.  It helped me better understand my frustration and the ramifications of hearing lossI especially liked the chapter on Cochlear Implant, and the depth of her research.  That said it is very readable and doesn't require a medical background.Her journey in the opening half of her book was tedious, but laid the foundation for what followed.It has focused my own journey...and where I need to concentrate my future energies.It should be available in ENT offices."
"I have taken this product a couple of times since I had the product. And to me it works slow I'm going to assume.  I haven't seen any results since taken it. I do say you get alot of product for your money which is a plus. However I dont want to compromise the quality or quanity. So i went with something stronger as well. Also I read an article about these types with Garcinia Cambogi a and it had Dr.Oz talking about the products saying he stand it and it works. However the Senate or who ever she was said other wise. Meaning  the product doesn't work.  Wish I had the link to it.  I'm sure I'm going to be returning it soon because I need something that shows me results at about the 2 week time frame.  And I know I put in the work ..5xs a week ..2xs a day  and yes I eat right majority of the time.  It's too hot to eat heavy foods.  I hope this helps.  I say Trial and Error."
"Well, there really isn't much I can say.  I got the game in a timely manner original case and all that, and there's nothing wrong with it.  I think this game deserves a 3 out of 5 because the actual game just kinda sucks. I mean, you figure that for Dreamcast the graphics would be better, and that there would be a more in depth storyline. It simply put falls short of other versions.  Honestly, I miss arcade systems :/"
"The control is hard, and the story is,...okay.  Other than that it offers online gameplay, and is a cool game to own."
"It works just fine and arrived early, i have no complaints at all, considering it was not expensive either. Two thumbs up!"
"Well, it came in timely, had no defects, and it looks great on the system.  Not a bad price either.  I suggest getting one for your slim as well."
"This has got to be one of the most interesting games I've ever played for Sega. Not only did I never hear of it before I watched Angry Video Game Nerd in 2013, but surprisingly, Game Nerd was incorrect when he said this game was not fun to play. Watching stock footage does get a tad bit annoying, but you have to consider this is where all the new games got their ideas from. It's the equivalent to watching a story line for Resident Evil or Final Fantasy.  What's more interesting is how they did it because this was in the year 1993, before the technology was even close to what we have now.  You wouldn't believe how fun it is to watch these ugly zombies creep, run, jump, and fly towards you while you're desperatey trying to switch your ammo to kill shaman and restore your old soldier friends back to normal.  The movie is a lot of fun to watch on this with great one liners and a fake Jamaican and cheesy dumb blonde as a news reporter.  The fact is this game plays like a new video game. The only downside is you'll have to blow and clean your 32 x for what felt like a month before the thing would work. I think this is because they 32 x was so underplayed that it just doesn't want to work right away..poor guy."
"Well, what can I say really?  I bought a cord for my Dreamcast prior to these, and I wasn't happy with the results.  The RF adapter still works, however the one I had, not so good.  Every time I played a game the screen would have fuzzy hair moving up and down.  It discredited the Dreamcast's graphic ability since the first day I used that RF adapter.  Before I bought the AV cable, I tried researching ways to make the Dreamcast look even greater on HD TV.  The answer for that would either be the AV cable or a different adapter.  It's easy enough to look up online, but this baby here works just fine.  Not only does everything look great, but it came through the mail in a timely matter.  I have no quarrels over this product at all.  It's easy to hook up, and it'll go to practically any new tv."
"I didn't know where to start.  I wanted to record things, and had no money for an expensive digital camera.  When I got this, it satisfied me greatly. I recommend it."
"Me parece excelente servicioRecibi mi Gift Card sin ningun problemaLes dar&amp;iacute;a 10 estrellasNo tengo ningun disgusto por el servicio"

"For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]Laurel is fifteen years old. She is not an ordinary teenager. She eats only fruits and vegetables and drinks Sprite. Since she was a child, she was home schooled on her family land near Orick, California, but when her parents decide to move to Crescent City, she has, for the first time in her life, to go to public school. Her first days at Del Norte High School are difficult, but soon she meets David, the handsome and sweet science nerd and Chelsea. But a hump starts to grow on her back. At first she thinks it's a pimple, her first!, but it grows day by day, becoming difficult to hide. She soon discovers that a flower grows on her back. That's when Laurel is embedded in a tale of magic, intrigue, love and danger where she meets Tamani, a faery, and other evil creatures.Although the start was a bit slow, I could not stop reading from about the fiftieth page. I don't know exactly what happened or what changed, but it gets better. I started and finished it the same night. The idea behind the book is very original. I admit not having read many books about fairies, but the concept seemed pretty original to me. I look forward to learn more about Avalon and fairies in the next novels because we didn't learn a lot in this one.I loved, loved, LOVED Tamani. I think he's the reason why I loved this book so much. His dialogues made me laugh every time and his relationship with Laurel is so much more exciting and intense than the relationship of Laurel and the other guy, I loved every of their scenes when they were together! Their romance was charming. And I loved the end! For those who read the book, you may know why!Something I didn't like was how some characters reacted. The first scene I can think of is when Laurel tells David about her blossom. I found his reaction completely unreal. How could someone be so calm when learning something this strange...Still, it's a novel I recommend. It's an easy, light read, perfect for people who are looking for an entertaining book! I can't wait to read Spells! The book cover is really simple yet cute. After reading it, I can say the wings formed with flower petals fit the story perfectly."
"For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]We're thrown right into action from the first page. The book begins where we left of in Nightshade. It's packed with information. We learn about Searchers and their world, the real story of the war between Searchers and Keepers and Shay's role in all of this. Even if the pacing was slower because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was necessary, the author had to explain everything before getting into the plot. I loved learning about the truth at the same time as the pack. Some stories surprised me like the one about Ren's mother.Like I said in the review of the previous book, I loved the characters. It was the same in this one. I was anxious to find out what happened to all of them when Calla left at the end of Book 1 because I could very well imagine that it would not be good for them. I can only think of Ansel, Calla's brother...  The new characters introduced in this novel were interesting. I absolutely loved Connor and his humor even when everything was going wrong. His bickering with Silas made me smile. And what happens with Ethan, his evolution, is cute.Overall, it was a good read. I felt like nothing really happened. But the next book will be filled with action that's for sure!"
"Thethird book is action-packed. If you like action, you will be served in this one! There is almost no break, we go from one place to an other. There is no time to waste before the final battle happens. Between the planning and the hunt for the pieces of the cross, of course there was also a time for romance.Calla is still torn between Shay and Ren. When she's with one, she can't stop thinking about the other. I was a little disappointed with what she did with both men. She acted selfish and it was like she didn't think about their feelings. I think she should have done things differently.The end ruined it for me. I enjoyed the book so much, but I still can't believe what happened. I was really really really disappointed to read how the love triangle ended because it was one of the easiest possible way to do it. That's the worst ending someone could ever imagine. I don't understand why, I just don't.But a good read anyway. I think even with all the disappointed fans, you need to read it to see for yourself. One scene doesn't make the book. I was also pleased to see that Andrea Cremer decided to write a fourth book in the trilogy: Snakeroot and I will definitely read it! I'm intrigued about what it will be about."
"I like to get books for my grandchildren to read.  I always read the books first to see if the book will hold the kids interest.  It is always nice if the book has a good moral also.  This book wins in both of these areas.  I even enjoyed this book."
"Enjoyable books.  You wish for a hero you find in each of these books and dream of being the lucky girl involved. I will be looking for more books from this author."
"First and foremost, it's a hidden objects game.  If you do not like such games, don't play this one.  It's also a Facebook game at heart meaning you can play so often.  All in all, it's not the greatest game, but it is decent."
"The game left so much room for a back story.  This series fills it in nicely.  A great read so far."
"Legendary is a deck building game from Upper Deck Entertainment, which uses Characters from Marvel Comics.  There are over 10 heroes to chose from, with 4 different villainous master minds to chose from, as well 11 villain groups and henchmen, and, thanks to schemes, has a different objective each game.This program is not a mobile version of the Legendary card game, but rather is a tool to make set up a lot faster.  What it does is it takes the available card groups available in the game, and according to the number of players (more players mean more cards in the villain deck), and randomly selects the Master Mind, and the scheme for the game; the number of scheme twist cards, the number of bystanders, the number of Master Strike cards, and which henchmen groups, and which villain groups for the villain deck; and which heroes for the hero deck.My biggest complaint is that I can't select 5 players, which isn't that big of a problem, since we only play with 3 or 4 players.  As expansions are released for Legendary, expect updates to come for this app."
"It does its job!!will buy another one for my highs..always loved old school brands... Beats anyother amp I have bought"
"it was still the wrong one but i wont send back because i dont have time to wait for it to be fixed again."
"Its good for a quickie. A Wiccan woman is hired to help a werewolf find his mate to insure his pack's future. But she's closer than either one of them realize. I want to find longer books from Hanson I like her writing style."

"the details are not good,only one meaning for each word is given.Also, explanations and examples are required for anyone trying to learn a foriegn language. the sole purpose of the dictionary is not fulfilled."
"its a great help. the explanations are well detailed and extremely helpful. i would recommend this dictionary to anyone wanting to learn French :)"
"good product, works well and great price. i would recommend this product to someone looking for cds for burning onto to add music."

"I bought this corset because i wanted to try &amp;#34;waist training&amp;#34; and i have to say i'm in LOVE! It's super easy to put on by yourself, and the material isn't cheap. I'll be getting my next corset here as well."
"This case doesn't work the way it's supposed to it definitely doesn't glow n the dark like it says and it was a waste bv I wanted it to glow n the dark"
"Childhood favorite and brought it for my little one he really likes it! Hes only 3 and is reading it cover to cover already (by memory) Mines didnt come with the paper cover over it but It still had a cute little design! Good buy!"
"Got it for my 3 year old son! yes I said son He saw it the library and loved it! Hes a big reader and ranges from superhero books to five little monkeys to fancy nancy. Its really good for young kids and He loves saying the fancy words and repeats them to his older cousins and it makes him feel superior! I love them! great buy and perfect size for smaller hands ( Not too big, not too small). Overall I am very pleased and recommend these books for young girls and boys!"
"Brought it for a 7 year old girl! She really likes its! Its bigger then expected and has alot of pages! 890 i think... It also has activities and little questionaires I thinks its more suitable for girls ages 7-13. Younger girls might have a hard time with the questions and games depending on there ability to read. Its also heavy for smaller girls. It is really cute and a great buy for some one with a low budget!"
"it isnt from hp from but it works well. No problems after a month. It is shorter then the original but I dont mind considering the cost difference. It does get a little hot but all chargers do with much use! I would recommend!"
"I purchased this and received it two days later! As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this!"
"Came by mail needed it quickly and got it quick! Brand new and very useful. Great price!!!! I definitely recommend this!"
"Definitely recommend this beats the prices in other stores by far and really does protect my ipod from scratches and other marks as it has fallen a few times and it has nothing with this on it!"
"Great bed! Sturdy and works nice with foam mattress. It is comfortable and durable. Does need some maintenance as there will be loose screws but once tightened they stay in fine! would recommend this product especially for the price!"
"brought it for a game. Didn't fit my guy but he has really thick long hair so all his hats need to be bigger but for women and children and men with short hair cuts I recommend this! It is adjustable! Great price and great quality."
"A Great Read! Someone needs to make this into a movie: Magyver mixed with Mission Impossible! Very difficult to put down once you start."
"This is a great read wit ha few very unexpected happenings...even for Reilly. Looking forward to reading his next book"
"This was an OK read, but was a bit slow and maybe it was just me, but I found it a bit difficult to follow at times"
"Good story and leaves the story open for a sequel. This will make a rival to the Hobbit, but has heaps of character commentry and social comment."
"I could not have imagined how bright a small single battery flashlight could be. The clip makes it very convinient to hang it on your belt for hiking or other places. Go for it"
"I was disappointed in this release.I have been a huge Chrissie Hynde fan since the very first Pretenders album.This record is too pop oriented for my taste,The songwriting collaboration between Chrissie and Bjorn Yitling is much weaker than her previous work.There is even a track with whistling on it similar to the Peter Bjorn and John hit &amp;#34;Young Folks&amp;#34;.The 2 stars are for Chissie's great voice.No one in rock 'n' roll can kick your ass or tear your heart out like Ms. Hynde.Please reform The Pretenders."
"although they dont fall under army regulations i dont advise you wear them in garrison, but down range who cares. hiking up mountains was so much easier because i wasnt busting my butt everywhere. breathable REALLY breathable feet get cold in the winter. weight was  rediculously light i compared them to the nikes and its a really close call. overall for a down range boot A++"
"Fast delivery. Quality product. Very comfortable with a good tight and secure fit. I recommend these gloves to all Soliders and others."
"its hard for me to describe the perfection of this armwatch braught to me at the first time i saw it ... fall in love at frist sign :XxX perfect from the shape.the color. the detail .... YOU SHOULD BUY IT , IT WORTHS YOUR MONEY AND YOUR WAITING TIME ...HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
"After reading the sample of Absorbed I had to find out what the deal was with the overly passive woman Violet and her secretly abusive boyfriend Mick. Everyone loves ""life is more fun when he's around"" Mick, however, behind closed doors he's a jerk. But when Violet receives a beautiful gift from a secret admirer, things change for everybody. A straightforward and good horror story."
"This is an excellent, well written set of horror stories. The first two are like dark fairy tales. With This Ring has little mazes as illustrations of key plot points. The third story takes a psychological turn. In Losing Dan the question of 'I wonder what they were thinking just before that unthinkable act' is answered. I almost wish it was left unanswered, I had such a strong visceral reaction to this story. The fourth story is about a woman who moves into a literally distressed property. I particularly like the ending. Special mention has to go to the last story in the collection, Flood of Darkness. If the best part of Losing Dan was getting into someone's mind then it is fitting that the final story not only delves into the mind of its troubled narrator but also provides a suspenseful story about a natural disaster. Things get very intense before the completely satisfying end. I'll be looking for more by this author."
"I liked how the layout of the pouches were. They held all my tools that I need. I hate making many trips to the truck so I carry everything in my pouches so that part was great. Also, the suspenders didn't hinder my overhead reach much compared to other suspenders that I've tried. Being an electrician I often do work off ladders, having arm movement is a must so that was nice.  The biggest problem I had was that I wore the belt a week and it started fraying around the metal gromits. At first I just took a lighter and melted the nylon but it soon became too much of a problem for being a new belt."
"Some are a little hard but its a really good game. I am glad some are hard though because i like a challenge."
"Glad I bought this. didnt had enough money to spend so decided to go with this coat. its good coat."

"Of all the places you can think of, the public library was the last place I'd thought I would find this CD. My granddaughter is a great fan! We checked it out and she loved it, so I bought it for her birthday, Shhhhh!  it's May 14th"
"This poster is great, a great find! it features the color combanation we are seeking. It gives the the feeling of adventure,travel, excitement. We got the feeling of ""someday"" we would love to visit Paris.I had the poster applied to foam core to give it stability in the frame. Looks Great! I recommend it for any room."
"My granddaughter is into everything &amp;#8220;Paris&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;I bought this for her to hang off her backpack. I was a little disappointed that a little part of it broke off, so now it doesn&amp;#8217;t stand as a matter of fact, it&amp;#8217;s in the trash. Guess you get what you pay for&amp;#8230;"
"My granddaughter choose the &amp;#34;Paris Theme&amp;#34; for her bedroom. she likes the modern look more than the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; as she called it.I have to steer away from &amp;#34;to much Eiffel Tower&amp;#34; as she wants more variety than just that.

Khalid Hosseini once again weaves a tale of love, sacrifice, human endurance in a land completely foreign to me but somehow brought to life with words that placed me right in the heart of the story.  I couldn't put the book down. Thank you Mr. Hosseini for painting such a vivid picture."

"I have purchased an airbrush from harbor freights it was ok while it lasted. I have asked people around and did my own research on certain airbrush products. The ones most airbrush artist use is &amp;#34;iwata&amp;#34; or so I have seen. I am just beginning so I know others have their own perks, but by far this is the best I have held and used and now I am starting off seeing the true difference in my art work. Really like this product"

"Very good character development in this intriguing book. I looked forward to having time to read so I could find out what happened to the characters, who became like friends. This was a good read by what I presume is a first time author. The author hinted at future books involving these characters, and I anxiously await their publication."
"Great flag! Would and will buy again. Nice material and nice stars. The only thing that I would like to see would be larger eyelets, but there just fine for most people."
"The best insulated, spill proof mug you can by!! I have 6 of them away for Christmas and everyone has loved them!"
"This game is just incredible, and a must-have for SMT fans. It's a turn-based strategy JRPG, and a good one at that. The atmosphere is just the right amount of creepy and incredibly intriguing. Played the persona games but not sure if you'll like the other SMT stuff? Give this a shot, you won't be disappointed C:"
"Very cute charm necklace set, picked it up for me and my sis. I felt a bit worried after reading the reviews that the chain itself was a bit flimsy, but as long as you're not running a marathon or doing construction work in it, it should be fine. Even then, I still recommend getting a new chain for it, just in case. The charms themselves are high-quality and very pretty! My sister loves hers and I've been wearing mine everywhere. Product also arrived much earlier than expected, thanks! If you're a Miku fan who likes things like this, or even just someone looking for a cute set of necklaces, I'd recommend!"
"I have 3 small dogs, so it is a little challenging trying to work with them together; however, this is the first training program we've tried that is working.

On her first investigation, she finds signs that several crimes have been perpetrated by a sadistic and brutal serial killer and linked them together.

"I bought this flavor to try it. It is alright, however it is defiantly not the best flavor ever. The protein does its job, but I wish I had gotten chocolate flavor."
"These did there job but they also leaked when you took them out of the printer. I wouldn't exactly recommend these if your not on a budget."
"This is my first one star rating. I didn't buy the game, but I rented it from redbox first to see how I likes it before I spent $30. I'm glad I only paid $2 because this game is no fun at all. I did not like anything in this game."
"I ordered this thinking for nearly $8 it was a three pack. It wasn't until after it shipped that I realized I had just paid $8 for ONE screen protector. I just received it and it seems to be pretty good quality, but I wont know until I put it on my girlfriends phone. I only gave it two stars because it was poorly labeled and I have hopes that it will be a good screen protector."
"This was literally the fastest none amazon prime shipping I have ever encountered. I ordered it on a Sunday night, it shipped on Monday and I got it today (Wednesday). As far as the product it was also the easiest screen protector I have ever put on before. I have never been able to get a screen protector on without air bubbles before. The only thing I do not like about this product is because it is matte, it has a pixel look when it is on the phone. On top of the pixel look it also has a little bit of a rougher feeling to it. But besides those two little points I can get over, this is the perfect screen protector!"
"I got this on time and started to use it right out of the box. After it died I charged it for somewhere around 4 hours (until the red light turned green indicating it is fully charged). I then pluged it into my phone which was at 17% and an hour and a half later it died after charging my phone an aditional 72%. I believe this product is worth your money!"
"I had orginally bought a very similair Gerry jacket at sports authority, but a week later the zipper broke off. I bought it knowing the zipper had problems, but I didn't think it was going to break like it did. So I returned it and bought this one on amazon. It is nearly identical to my orgibal one. It keeps me super warm and keeps the wind out. I also really like the fact you can zip the other jacket into the bigger jacket. The only down fall on this jacket is the Velcro straps on the sleeves. The Velcro works but they made the strap out of flexable plastic so if you made the sleeves as tight as you could you have like half of the strap hanging out.. but other than that it is great and I love it!!!"
"Excellent book.  Excellent service.  This is the standard (a must) for beginning to intermediate violin players.  Highly recommend starting with this book!"

Tambi&amp;eacute;n a aquellos que deseen hacerse responsables de su &amp;#34;sombra&amp;#34;"
"i ordered with my new guitar. These straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here."
"I'm now have my music together, great for small space &amp;#34;does it works&amp;#34; limit to one mic, but enogh for me."
"Was a little skeptical, especially for the price, but it works just like the name brand! Just soak in water and all sorts of marks disappear. The only thing that would make it better is a scrubber pad on one side for stubborn marks. Will definitely purchase again!"
"This is a nice start to a new series.  I am looking forward to the next installment!My only complaint would be the same as other &amp;#34;1st&amp;#34; books in series, lots of background to set the stage for the series.  Though I guess I would complain if there wasn't enough!  Good read!"
"The book was okay.  Not one of my favorites but didn't hate it.  The story was getting very tired and I couldn't wait until it was over.  I normally have to make myself slow down and savor a book or become mad that it is over."
"When I started this series, I wasn't so sure I would finish it.  A little slow at the start but takes off quickly.  Very interesting plot development, characters are complex and lovable.  I found myself searching for more by this author.  Definitely worth the price.  If you enjoy the zombie genre you will thoroughly enjoy each of these books."
"As with any new series a little slow to start, then smacks you in the brain!  Love the characters, plot development and left me wanting the next book right away!"
"While I enjoyed most of this one, I felt like the author just gave up 3/4 way through and then just ended.  Very interesting twist on the zombie experience."

"I have had the Keurig mini, B-60 and B-70 special editions. I loved the SE but it took up too much space, as I am the only coffee drinker in the home. I would have never bought this machine if I knew the trouble I was going to have.. Right away the first 3 kcups I used the cup did not even fill halfway and the coffee looked like water.. the machine does not punch into the kcup from the top. I then tried Apple Cider and the same thing.. I have to puncture the kcup myself.. Its just not a good machine. It leaks from the top and honestly I would spend 15 more next time for a different brand."

"This case is really pretty and elegant.. Its sturdy and protects my phone without being bulky like other cases I've had."
"BAD MOVE WITH THESE LED LAMPSMy plan was to replace my Halogen Lamps of about 3000 hours life expectancy with these. Typical LED Lamps last 50,000 hours. Not only would I be saving energy, but they would be lasting 15+ times longer.Out of the (18) I purchased less than 2 months ago only two still are working.....soon to be DEAD (should be lasting YEARS).I Have bought other LED's and will continue to do so, I just wont buy these."

Only 2 of 120 did not work, but my fiance managed to fix them both.There were 4 batteries that didn't work as well.I didn't receive any extra batteries in my order like the description stated. Otherwise, I'm happy with the lights.I also tested one out last night submerged in water.I put it in at 8pm, this morning when I left for work at 7am, it was still working fine"
"Jeannette Walls portrays her story in a humorous way that touches you &amp; makes you believe in hope &amp; that anyone can get through anything to reach their goals."
"The screen protector was not tight enough on the screen and dirt constantly got between the screen and the screen protector.  The back had nice grip and not too bulky, but I wouldn't recommend this case."

"Tami Hoag does it again!!! From the first chapter to the very last word, The 9th Girl is another ""can't put it down"" ""just one more chapter"" great book. Like lots of her books, it can get graphic at times. Not overly so, but the reader definitely needs to be able to be able to picture the crime scene of a horribly murdered young girl. Also the autopsy, and the investigation of her, and other similar murders. For me, that's one of the things that makes her books so great!!!! She really brings the reader into the story. I'm not some sick and twisted serial killer, but, I love reading about them. Especially reading about the combination of the forensics and police work that help catch these people, and get them off the streets. Forensics fascinate me, and this book, has some of that, along with the thrill of the feeling that you're part of the investigation, while safely at home. It also talks about bullying and what it can lead to!!!! Also it shows how one person can make a difference by standing up against it!!!!! Great read!!!! Highly recommended it!!!!!"
"I was first introduced to ClariS via the television anime Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai. (My little sister can't be this cute) Oreimo  for short. Irony is the opening theme song and has a great beat and amazing lyrics. Claire and Alices' voices are like nothing you've heard before. Check it out and check out Oreimo, its a wonderful show."

"This is a well written book that is aimed at practitioners. Some of the ideas have been implemented in our inventory system (Premier Foods, UK). We've all read the theories of inventory control at some point or another, but Yang provides sound guidance towards transferring theories into practice for deteriorating products. Each suggestion is well grounded in common sense and experience. Regardless of whether you are in manufacturing, distribution or retail, you will find ideas in this book that are applicable in you business."

"If you are a fan of Elizabeth II this book is definitely a must read. It's quite informative, but not judgemental. The only objection I had was to much focus on politics and queen's relationship with her prime ministers and far to little information about her family and other aspects of her life."
"The wine opener adds color to my bar and works beautifully -- much better than my old corkscrew.  I also like the attachment that enables you to cut the paper covering the cork."
"Sweet and simple! I don't need anything too fancy and this works great. For some reason the original sweeper is harder to find than I thought. I love how you can mop and sweep using the same apparatus."
"No Cracked lips anymore , even my hubby has started using it :) Wherever I go I keep this one with me . Its a Life Saver."
"Fits perfect. Seems to be new, even though it was listed as &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;. Great item and fast shipment. My phone is like new!"
"Great battery. Lasts a long time. I think some reviewers, who might say, it doesn't last as long as their origianal battery, don't realize, that they have more apps on their phone, that run in the background, that drain the battery now, than when their phone was new."
"no matter what your age, it makes you want to go to the beachnot many lame lyrics, just great guitar !"
"Love it ! At first I was hesitant but I went for it and I loved it. It makes ur screen look and feel awesome. No glare from the sun. It gives your phone a nice matte look. Reccomended."
"Easy to assemble, sturdy, can't beat it for the money and my dog loves having her own space.  Great Deal!"
"I've assembled lots of things. I recently just purchased furniture from Ikea. Assembled, no sweat.  This bed is so frustrating to put together it's taken me 3 days b/c I have to get up and walk away from it. Now that it is assembled it is not sturdy. The screws are all very loose b/c of the material that they are embedded in.  It's a cheap bed but I was expecting it to last at least a year. I may toss it before I even use it."
"Awesome game. Lots of things from the past to remember! Will have your memory jogging trying to go figure them all out!"
"Had a lot of fun playing this. Wish it was longer though. 5 stars for sure. I highly recommend this game to any one looking for a challenge."
"I think this game is fun. I also like this sort of game. If you enjoy hidden objects games you will like this."
"I'm a professional wood worker with 22 years under my belt building full custom  furniture.  I have used many other brands and styles of compound miter saws. when i  used this bosh  Saw i was blown away by the eas of cuts and in the ease of the moments when used as slide saw. The movements were flawless and easy to move.. the one draw back was its moves to easily and you must adjust it moments to help a bit ..i used the drag screw to give just a bit of resistance..perfect saw  for me"
"i have this case in pink also for my iPad and now i am not so scared my kids will drop it/ my daughter has no case and she broke her ipad screen but dropping it once."
"This is a great shower-head that was well worth the price. Very powerful after I replaced one that was barely providing any pressure. The only downfall to this specific shower-head (to me at least) is that it is not adjustable."
"I have received a lot of compliments from my friends that even purchased one more as a birthday gift to my manager."
"These are the best lip glosses for the selection of colours, taste, texture and absolutely the best lip plumpers. They work long-term, they don't sting. I've been using different shades of this wonderful product for years and will continue to do so. Although, I have tried most other ones. This one is the best."
"Item as described. Fast shipment. Color was a little dull in comaprison with the picture but I am over all happy with this otter box cover."
"too much texture, hindered touch screen usuage a little and dirt was allowed underneath surface easily. It was an inexpensive purchase so I got what I paid for."
"The water flows really well (controlled flow) even my toddler can drink it in the car without spilling.It keeps the water cool during summer too. I got it when amazon had 40% sale, and I regret that I didn't buy more!"
"This hook is really pricey but it does what it supposed to.Gladiator has a cheaper bike hook to hang vertically, but i still prefer this horizontal bike hook."
"Updated review:After 5 months using this mat, I'm very impressed.Its easily cleaned and now the mat is flat on the floor, i didn't even do anything to straighten it!Love this mat! I'm planning to get another one for my husband's office.I'm looking for a sturdy clear plastic to cover my hardwood floor from my daughter's messy eating habit.The other kids floor covers are either flimpsy or has kidddy pattern.This mat works great because it allows the crumbs to dry and i can just sweep or wipe. So much easier to clean than hardwood floor.The only downside is the wrinkles that comes from folding it in the box when it was delivered.I'm not sure how can i make it straight but for now it works okay for us."
"This is very very useful thing that you must have. It is maybe a little expensive but it worth to its price because in each potato making time a save almost an hour. Put potatoes in it and forget it for 45 minutes."
"The board, bank notes and cards are very nicely decorated with the Yellow submarine film's characters/scenes. The only thing I don't like much is that &amp;#34;houses&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;hotels&amp;#34; are named &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;submarines&amp;#34; but the plastic figures are still the same classic houses and hotels. It would have been great if &amp;#34;submarines&amp;#34; were actually yellow submarines."
"I was very happy with these coveralls ...... very warm and durable.  The size runs a little large.  Sorry I didn't buy this after the price dropped."
"This product was shipped to Amazon very poorly .....  it must have seen the rack track because of the carton it came in.  I only used this bed for 16 nights and a seam ( defective ) started to leak and the bed was going flat.....A lesson to be learned ..... if the packaging has been compromised SEND it back..... It's probably a second or defective and was returned before......Then the deduct $51.00 from the return ...... extreme caution !!!!"
"This is so needed for all of my tools and I am happy and pleased that it is easy to find them and it is the answer to what I was using...."
".It's a fun game to play and its what I look for in a hidden object game. It's the best I've played in a while"
"Very handy, very reasonable. If staff lose one, or customers forget to return one, it is not a major expense"
"I haven't finished this book yet, but so far I'm enjoying it very much.  Very well-written, and very thought provoking.  I love historical novels anyway, and this subject matter is interesting...former slaves who now own slaves.  A good book, to me, is one that has good character development so that you care about and want to learn more about them.  This does that for me, and I'm looking forward to sharing their journey.  I would recommend it to any historical novel reader like myself."
"Good ideas and tons of beautiful photographs for anyone looking for ways to decorate on a budget.  Loved it, and highly recommend."
"This monitor far surpassed our expectations. The picture is very clear, night vision and daytime color. It seems to have a shorter battery life than I expected, but it's not short by any means. Just plug it in and recharge it when it's not being used. It doesn't pick up every single little sound our daughter makes, but it picks up 99% of them. It even picks up doors closing, loud cars on the road outside, and the furnace kicking on and off. I love being able to see what my daughter is doing in real time, not pixelated, and also hear her."
"I was searching for a good zoom lense, I narrowed down my search to 70-300mm and 55-250mm IS II. I did lota reasearch and selected 55-250mm IS IIIS II specificaly coz as the name suggest IS &amp;#34;image stabilization&amp;#34; and I needed it badly since I was not a pro then but after 6 months of use, I say this is the one that I needed. Yes the price, It is resonable for an IS II and I didn't have plans of spending more, otherwise I would have gone for 70-300mm IS."
"Lots of space!!"
"But It will be good if you give some info for dummies in the area. I had to replace by myself and it was kind of difficult."
"Compr&amp;eacute; este tel&amp;eacute;fono para traerlo a Vzla y todo va muy bien. Excelente vendedor altamente recomendado a toda la comunidad."
"I ordered this item and it shipped one day later than mentioned, although not a big deal. It also worked (pretty well) for 2 days and not does not work at all. When plugged in, it no longer lights up or turns on. It also had a VERY strong plastic odor smell that made me nervous. I am very unhappy and upset that i wasted my money and my patience on this order."
"Super cute! :) Glad i ordered this. Had it on for a few weeks, never take it or my pandora bracelet off. Hasn't tarnished!"
"I bought this item a few weeks back. Right after opening the package I found that only a few of the cables worked. More not working than are. A little disappointed, as I was going to give a couple to my mom and sister but couldn't once I realized they did nothing when connected to the iphone cube and to my phone."
"I was skeptical but this stuff made my baby's eczema go away within days! It's gone! He would scratch his head all the time from irritation but the scratching has stopped! Worth every penny."
"Even though my usage of these batteries is boringly constant, it seems that every once in awhile, I wind up with an unusually-short life.  It's sporadic, but it does happen."

"I have no idea what the other reviewers received, but my tuna came fast and is perfect! just the right size chucks and a pink color."
"This book was a great help for me to learn the stance for throwing, the actual throw, the follow-through, even how to make different targets to throw at, how to get more accurate, which knives are best to throw, and it shows samples of Gel's own knives and axes that he has made that are for sale. Great help."
"I am not too crazy about this product yet. I have not been taking it long enough to make a well determined call on if it is working or not yet."
"I have not been on this product long enough to be able to make a good call on whether it is working or not yet."
"This Star Wars IMPERIAL EMPIRE Logo Embroidered PATCH is amazing. I am in Afghanistan ATM and i have this on my flak. My buddies laughed so hard when i wore it the first day i got it. I attached 3M Fastener TB3571/TB3572 Hook/Loop Black, 1 in (25.4mm) x 10 ft (3.05m) to the back so it would attach to the velcro on the flak."
"This camera case is just what I needed to keep my camera safe while in Afghanistan! Small outside pocket for memory card or such is great."
"This Black Weatherproof Warm Nylon Faux Fur Pilot Aviator Trooper Trapper Hat is amazing! Nothing helps beat the cold Afghnistan wind than a hat like this."
"i received this item to my FPO AP in afghanistan two days prior to when it said it would be here. i was estatic. they are light and seem to be a good beginner knife, but you cannot go wrong with only 7 dollars. i would buy this again!"
"I received it at my FPO AP address right on time, which was a surprise, usually mail runs late, which also means if I was at a regular shipping address it would have come early. I was impressed by that, now I am just waiting to see if they trim off that last little bit of fat I want off."
"Ordered mine about a week after two of my friends, and got mine before them! this is a good buy. nice hat, and you have room on the front to customize it!"

"This is a great jacket, but 3 stars because I recieved the Mighty Lite II as opposed to the current model, the Mighty Lite III, listed here. Have tried all incarnations of this jacket and the subtle design tweaks in the Mighty Lite III made for an improved fit for me. Previous models were oddly narrow at the top of the sleeve, with uncomfortable seams in the pit area. My arms and shoulders are not big. I'm 5'5, 130, and a small in the Mighty Lite III is a more comfortable fit for wear with light or no layers vs. the previous models. That being said, I had to send the Mighty Lite II back and get the III directly from Columbia. Dissapointing to pay full price for an older model, when you can spend the same on the current updated version... which is what I thought I was getting here. Someone dropped the ball! Great jacket with great features, though. Figure flattering. Great as a mid-layer when it's very cold. Love the thumb-hole cuffs! Worth the trouble to get the right one."
"I love it billions of times that you say . I'm 13 and live for fairies yeah yeah as h yeah yeah"
"Absolutely worth every penny. Everything I hoped for and more."
"Morgan's Hunter is a great read! It has everything, love, suspense, heartbreak... It kept me wanting to read more.  I love the dynamic between Morgan and Hunter, the writer makes it so easy to connect with the both of them.  I felt like I was laughing, crying or on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book.  I'm excited to start book 2!!"

"MMMMMM. Yummy smelling. I use it in a reed/stick diffuser and put a few drops in the water pot on my Wood pellet stove. Keeps the air moisturized and smelling nice, with the water/oil combo.

"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these shoes! I have had mine for over a year now and they are still just a comfortable as when I bought them! I want another pai just in a different color!"

"I'd heard so many raves about its performance but I found no superstar.However, I think every woman should have one if she just wants to kick back and relax.This product requires a lot of manipulation."
"My only suggestion is to work on getting rid of the dark fuzzy shadowing at the bottom of the screen."
"This duvet set looks very good in the picture. However, the reality of it isn't the same.While it looks to be shades of brown - one of the prominent water-type markings is very black.  As well, one of the pillows is a very ugly green, which does not go with the set at all.Although I told the seller that I was returning the set as it was not as described - I was still required to return it at my OWN expense.  Then, 20% was deducted from my refund for a ""restocking charge""?I lost money and time on this mechandise and I would recommed to anyone thinking of buying this duvet set or dealing with this vendor, to think twice!"
"It does a decent job of removing 85% of the hair from the root, but the rest just gets cut down really short, I have seen the hair come back slower and thinner as it should. And I am using it in conjunction with the Kalo Hair Inhibitor treatment. I have reviewed that product as well for those of you whom may be interested."

"The Satin Booty Shorts state that they are One Size and they are far from One Size! I usually wear a juniors size 7 or 9 and was unable to wear these shorts. They have very little give in the waist area and they had a very long crotch area making them very unflattering. I was very excited to get these shorts but was very disappointed in their fit, I have sent them back because I would never feel sexy wearing them!"
"Great outfit! Very pleased with this one! The outfit is made well and was priced right! The shipping is a little longer but definitely worth the wait. The skirt is very stretchy so it is definitely a one size fits all unlike some of the other outfits that I get and they should be sized as a 0 or 3! Cant wait to get naughty!"

As I was looting houses I came across one of these bad boys. It opened all of my cans and dispatched some zombies along the way. I have never been hungry since."
"I bought this thinking that it would be the real constitution... I was wrong. Still great quality and very convincing, but I checked it and there is no secret writing like Nicholas Cage promised."
"Not sure why they took this off the market.  I absolutely loved Honey/Beige as the Natural Beige/cool is too white looking.  I live in Florida and have more of a tan.  Always had compliments that I looked younger....I'm 44 and people would say they thought I was in my 30's."
"I paid for the Action Replay DS, and I got it. But the problem is, it's one of the early versions of it and it was shipped to me with no AR CD/cord to quickly add games and cheat codes to my Action Replay DS; which means I have to insert everything manually with my DS touch screen's crappy keyboard.It can perform all the cheats Codejunkies has to offer, but if it's not pre-set, be prepared to spend a hell of a long time typing in each code."
"Air bubbles form early and often which makes it look a little bad and can be annoyingly hard to get rid of since the stickers are a little thicker than one is used to dealing with, but otherwise looks great and has a nice feel to it."

"Comfortable good looking shoe for work or casual wear.  I've gotten lost of compliments on them. I wear them all the time!"
"This screen protector was a plus it didn't have a lot of air bubbles and I loved that nobody could see who I was texting or what I was doing on my phone unless they got really close!"
"I over love these bracelets they are so freaking cute I am a pearl head so it was a plus to see the pearl bracelet and I love to wear a lot of bracelets at once! They don't turn colors like most fake jewelry and they have lasted me pretty long I got them three months ago!"
"I loved these earrings but they ended up breaking for no apparent reason I couldn't fix them. I had just gotten them. but I would recommend to anyone who likes them they look just like the picture and they came a couple days after I ordered them."
"Well I am a lipstick lover I try all kinds from MAC to the colors at the beauty supply store I just love lipstick. But these I didn't like they smell funny and don't last throughout the day the colors don't show up as well as I would like. I threw mine in the trash!"
"I love this case they don't make many good cases for my Note that's cute and protects my phone. This is why I love this case because it protects my phone and its different. It was delivered before the delivery date also! I am very pleased!"
"This book was very good. It was one of those page turners where you tell your self ok I will stop after this chapter so I can clean the house. Except at the end you have to know what happens next so you keep going. It had enough sensuality to make you sigh with relief and wish it was real. And the idea of vampire was original."
"Book. Arrived in good order and very quickly. My only disappointment was the postage and handling black plastic bag stapled and that cost me over 10.00. When the book weighed no more than 150gms. Was willing to pay because present for someone who had been looking for this book for a long while. Don't know that I would do it again would rather pay more for book"
"I have not seen a Pixar movie yet I have not liked, but this is one of the best. We saw this at the movies but I waited until the price came down a bit before adding to our library."
"This case is top of the line you can't beat it, the only drawback is its kind of hard to push the buttons because of the clear protective screen cover. It's a 10 for this case in all fields, protection, looks, and everything else you grade cases on."
"This case is just as good if not better than an otterbox. This case provides all the protection you could ask for and more, for the price its without a doubt the best case for the money."
"Oakleys are also well known name but honestly I was kind of disappointed with the quality of the frames the definitely feel like they could break easily if your not careful. It's the lens you pay for without a doubt but they could've made the frames feel a little less plasticy and cheap feel. But there Oakleys its the name your buying an expensive name at that"
"The case has proven to be very effective and somewhat stylish I will be ordering my future accessories this way from now on"
"I was shocked because it's smells exactly the same the only difference is the real one is real strong, this one is watered down or something, if you like smelling good plan on taking it with you cause you will need to reapply every couple hours as needed. But overall diesel is for the person who stands out and is looking to get noticed it will turn heads. Just be careful too much might clear the room."
"This book brought joy to my heart,tears to my eyes.The characters  are so real ,I could feel their pain ."
"Great for 4 year old just a little bit smaller then what i thought it would be but still great"
"We have viewed many lighthouses on the east coast and have collected a few. But this one was for a special friend thatwe had traveled with and just lost her husband.  A special memories, so to speak."
"This channel gives me important information regarding our ward.  I love it and hope to keep it updated.  It's great!"
"These were so cute that I purchased eight of them for gifts. They are easy to put on and the people I gave  them to loved them."
"We did away with our cable because the cost was getting way to high and I am currently a college student.  The price for the season through amazon, was way worth it!"
"The only reason I didn't give a five was because it gave the impression that Hank was only married once. From what I understand he was married a second time and I feel it was an insult to his second wife that she was not included in this movie. I understand it gave a better ending the way it was done, but when watching a so called true to life story, that is what I want it to be; not just another of those Hollywood jerks changing things the way they want. Still I had seen this movie two times before and wanted it in my collection along with Jerry, Elvis, Holly, Richie, Cold miner's daughter and others."
"Delivered on time.  As advertised.  Works great.  Especially like the back-up plugs/surge on one side and the surge protectors on the other side.,"
"Kind of boring. Wish there was more to it. Clues would be nice or a timer.Could be better.Doesn't take incubation power."
"This watch is very light weight, made of good quality rubber and works perfectly...exactly how i expected it to be!"
"took forever for this to come and it almost didn't come before I needed it for my daughters first birthday party...and when I got it I busted out laughing as it is very tiny like maybe 1.5 inches across the widest piece of the thing"
"This work out I can do at home. It's hard but at the same time I enjoy it. I feel so much healthier!"
"Marketed as XL barely fit over the work boot of a men's size 9. Definitely not as easy on/off process for going in &amp; out of customers' homes. Will not be purchasing again"
"My three year old was able to do this on his own pretty quickly, but he still loves to do this puzzle. He loved it so much, my husband and I are thinking about getting more for him to challenge him with a new one!"
"They worked well, and I would buy future sets. The included bags were a very nice touch as well. Thank you for a great product."
"Bought this toy for my 2 year old grand daughter and she really loves it!!!walks around all day with the picnic basket and plays feeding her dolls etc with all the cuos, cuttlery ,bread and cheese.She also loves the music and songs.just right size pieces to have  if you  a have younger baby sister around.not dangerous.Great toy and not expensive at all for what it is.thank you"
"I was skeptical when I first ordered this product because I thought that they were expensive for only getting 12 small blocks. However, the price is definitely worth it. The small size of the blocks is perfect for their little hands, but not too small where she has the potential to choke on them.I LOVE all the HABA products that I own because they are safe for my LO to put in her mouth (wooden blocks with non-toxic paint). The majority of my daughter's favorite toys are HABA products."
"I am enjoying this small pocket sized book of vast knowledge. It gives 40 days of insight from the Old Testament and Jesus Fulfilled  scriptures.  A ""messianic"" prophecy (prediction) from the Old Testament books are discussed each day for 40 days with the fulfillment of Jesus scriptures.  How awesome to have all this with thoughts and prayers for each day.  AWESOME. Pocket size too! Fits in your purse too!"
"I ordered this because my little brother wanted a TALKING tepig and instead got a normal plushie without the thing that makes it able to talk!!! So now my crybaby of a brother is crying because the stupid thing wont talk!!!!! I thought it said it was a TALKING TEPIG?"
"Movie wanted as a whim...happy I did. Was an unexpected pleasure. Guy Pearce and the young girl were wonderful together."
"The more number of control variables in a Board Game, the more interesting it becomes when it comes to designing a strategy. Settles of Catan is just a perfect example of that.PS: I was seduced into Board Games after reading Tim Harford's article on Board Games in FT."
"is a very good iron, your hair look beautiful and in just one pass!, does not hurt the hair! It is all I can say"
"Great and full of great info and insight on a phenomenal band and career. Know a lot about phish and was able to learn more."
"I've red behind the sun and girl of shadows in the last 3 weeks and now can't wait to get my hands on the silk thief,only it won't be out till nearly xmas,I'm sure it will be worth waiting for.I love Deborah's stories."
"The kick stand on the back of the case doesn't work. you can open it and set it down but it snaps closed almost immediately."
"I've read this countless times, and within a few pages, I'm once again immersed in th book. From the descriptions of underwater details, fish, treasures, even the sand, it's easy to get lost in it. Like a mini vacation every time. The characters are fully developed, drawing you in further. This is one crew I would love to treasure hunt with, and Marla could cook anytime!  An awesome read from my favorite author!"
"I bought this for the stand and it works so well! I love it, I really do. The stand works great and the case really protects my phone well. I have three sons and my youngest is only two. He loves playing with phones and he loves throwing them. It has really come in handy for protecting my phone."
"Sits up straight.  Very light weight. Easy to clean and folds easily. This Grandma loves it! It's a winner in my book."
"My Husband works 12 hour swing shifts, so this bag is plenty big enough to hold all his bottled water, sodas, and Gatorade, and I am talking about the big bottles, and then there is still lots of room left for his meal and snacks and whatever else he needs to take with him. It is well built and sturdy."
"i didn't actually &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; the strategy guid as ive played and have found everything in the game and i've done it all as well. but i had to have it because i wanted it."
"it's good, but it's not for everyone. the game has some annoying dubbing, granted they are just as annoying in japanese as well, o well that is what we get for asking dual audio, the english version always turns out shit."
"I really love this case, it fits with my nook simple touch perfect and arrived in just 3 days very happy with it."
"The quality of this cube is not really good, but what are you going to expect for the price, just fine if it is your first 2x2. I like it, but I think it could be better"
"This Item has everything you need! And the price is not bad its great for the quality of everthing you get."
"Sunday morning lounging and drive music if i have ever heard it. Makes me wonder why it never became popular in the States. A true British invasion of dreamy attitude and super sounds"
"Wow! I have searched high and low and finally found my printer cartridges at Office Depot-- paid $72 for 5 cartridges.  Depressing!Determined not to pay Office Depot prices again, I found Blake's on Amazon-- WHAT A VALUE. I purchased 10 cartridges for a fraction of what I paid at Office Depot, and they are exactly what I need.  Fast shipping too-- even at Christmas time. Thanks Blake Priting Supply!!"
"It was excellent. Very descriptive and interesting to read. Would be an wonderful gift for those who have everything. Must buy!!!"
"A bit slow in places didn't grab me early enough. When I persevered it picked up and was in the end a good story."
"Was not as useful as i thought it would be. Maybe will be more useful as we all get used to it and find out more. We don't use Facebook etc."
"I bought this screwdriver for a gift. My son loved it! He recently bought an older home and has a million applications for this screwdriver. He said it held power for a long time and was strong enough to get through old hard woods."
"My daughter loves this learning tool and fits nicely with the ABA Therapy we are also doing. Both family and therapists find the Cash Register easy to use and very life-like.We especially like the credit card processing facility on the register.Only one thing I would suggest is to please add the ability to change the Currency type to the Australian Dollar for example.  That would make it perfect."
"A fantastic looking watch that is nicely weighted. its not too light like some other cheaper watches.If your thinking about buying this watch go ahead as you wont be dissapointed.  I have had many comments on the watch, one workmate asked if it was a Rolex as it looks that good.Like other comments, the face is slightly darker than shown but I prefer that as it looks more sofisticated.  But to be honest most US based on-line web sites seem to be over brightning adverts these days.Thanks Bulova!"
"This game is ok, I wish this game was a little bit more entertaining.This game is perfect to fall asleep."
"While using it the first week it broke.  We were able to take it apart and fix the wire that came off.  The cats do love it though, it's better when you get it still and move it yourself because the cats like it better that way.  I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't broke because the cats do love it."
"After more than a month of use, the Infrared units are holding up great. The Beam is very powerful and can be reflected off things across the room and then come back and hit the eye. The wire supplied wasnt bad either, but the splicing connectors, even though they are of genius design, end up cutting the wire too much and losing connection. I ended up replacing all the existing wire and splicing the new units in the old fashioned way with just a twist and some electrical tape. Other than that, works fine."
"I bought these along with a combo pack of woodchips for our new electric smoker, and i must recommend them to everyone who handles meat in the kitchen or in the grill/oven/smoker. They are very heat resistant, durable, and are very easy to clean and keep sanitized. Great price aswell.The only thing i can think of as a con is that most meat, especially if it has a rub or sauce or any kind of juice/liquid on it is very slippery in these gloves, but that is because of the material they are made from."
"This is a really great knife, as long as you know a good, experienced knife sharpener.Pros -This is a really solid knife all around, great handle, great balance and feel, not too heavy not too light, and comes with a nice sheath. Feels very durable and is very comforting to have while in the backyard at night.Cons -This knife came to me not as sharp as i would expect from Ka-Bar. It's sharp enough for daily use, but it aint cuttin no arm hair. Real deal knives are supposed to be able to shave hair. I will be taking this to a good sharpener as soon as i find one. Had to take a star off for this."
"This is a good beanie, but it has a few things that could be better. The shape of the beanie is a little cone-ish. It could also be a little thicker to protect from wind and cold. Other than that, the fabric is nice feeling and well stitched, no loose threads so far. It is also very comfortable once you get it situated, and also stays in place alot better than most beanies if you have long hair."
"This light is one of the best USB lights ive owned. I play PC Games in a dark garage at night, and the Red light is perfect for illuminating the laptop keyboard and whatever else i need to see. The 3 light levels are cool, but the button feels a bit loose and wobbly, but so far has taken all my punishment. The neck is very bendable and twistable and seems to not want to twist at the connection base of the the USB plug, wich is good so the internal cord wont twist up and snap. Overall a great product and the ONLY Red LED USB Light you'll find out right now."
"This is a very nice cable. Its really thick, has very sturdy connectors, and looks good. It also performs well, i use it to watch TV, then i switch it out to the computer, and everything looks good."
"These are the best boxers ive ever owned. They are very comfy, have no tag to bother you, and also bend very well with the body when stooping, crouching, crawling or any other activity that require extreme bending of the body. They are also well ventilated to help dissipate &amp;#34;Man Heat&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Man Sweat&amp;#34;. Would recommend them to everyone."
"The product is great!the design is very cool, shiny black not fancy stuff, just black.The sound is very good. the highs are very clear the bass is very deep and full. Middle great as well.But you have to know how. First of all, change your Equalizer. it REALLY!! makes a huge difference. second, place the sound system on a dresser or something like that, it increases the bass incredibly and makes it even better.Linking up with the devices (iphone 4s and macbook pro) worked perfectly fine if you read the instructions.But: sometimes (once every ten minutes) the sound experiences small problems. but they don't last half a second so it's fine if you're not a soundphile person.I love them and can only recommend them.Update: Since many people experienced problems after a short while I just wanted to say that I bought it four months ago, use it everyday and didn't have single problem!"
"I purchased this trilogy for $7.99 but would also have paid more.It's a great bundle of the my favorite GTA games (3, Vice City and San Andreas)!I have a 2012 MacBook Pro and all three games work perfectly fine!It comes in a sealed trilogy DVD-box with all the manuals and poster-sized street maps they used to sell with the original CD boxes.The code is on the backside of the San Andreas manual and registers all three games one at a time.Great deal and works perfectly on my mac!!"
"I love this show, they should have won an emmy award.  The sets are gorgeous and characters fasinatingHighly Recommend it."
"I really like this jacket!!! It fits really well, and it is not to bit or to small it fits just right!!!!"

"Unfortunately the advertisement did not mention the item I bought was a small size and would not fit a man with size 12 feet so its totally worthless to Me.  Product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  It looks like just what I need, but unfortunately is way to small.  Guess when I eventually have a garage sale I have one more item to put in it."
"LOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!"
"It takes a master with a crystal clear mind and a total understanding of totality to write a book like that..LOVE"
"This movie has Scorsese's name associated with it? Did he think that EDITING might be in order? Marty, please! 3 hrs of the same sequences in different settings: car, bedroom, plane, etc. Note quite as boring and mindless as &amp;#34;Gravity,&amp;#34; and certainly better acting, but I did walk away mid way through. I felt like they were trying to do an ill -  conceived remake of Decaprio's role in &amp;#34;Catch Me if You Can.&amp;#34; Here his character was drug-addeled and shallow."
"I love this game the only thing is that you get pets but you can have two of a kind of pets.Otherwise it's awesome you should get it."
"It was perfect. A new favorite, for sure. Wish I had bought more of them, actually&amp;#8230; Apparently I need a few more words so I added this line to the end."
"So nice looking on nails, very easy to use, it was amazing packed  well and there is no damage, compare to similar of this, super great product, that's include the price and free shipping, by my house i found a Sally Beauty Store, and they don't have this Nail Tape Stripe, and i wasn't happy, because when i called to the store they told me they have this product in the store, and that's why i like amazon, because i can find everything, and i'm happy."
"This brushes are amazing,  fantastic for the price, The delivery was wonderful, came safely packaged and arrived much earlier than the date it was expected, the brushes come packed in the role and are protected by plastic covers to ensure they were in perfect condition great quality,  very professional, I love the smooth brushes for making my nail art, It was much bigger than what i was expecting, I am very pleased with the product, and will definitely be looking for similar products on here in the future."
"I ordered the 350buy Fashion Caviar Nails Art New 12 Colors plastic Beads Manicures, I was looking for this caviar pearls for my nails,I was fortunate to find it available on Amazon.com, for extraordinary price,  I thought it was an absolutely fantastic idea to create a 3D effect with tiny pearls on my nails for my son's graduation, The application of the pearls is very easy, The package is in a cardboard box with the product details on the front, the caviar pearls are in a  transparent plastic packaging and can keep each color in their place, I am really satisfied with my product."
"A great product, these Rhinestones are really nice, are cute, they are small, shiny and colorful, Comes a lot of them, perfect for my nail art, the Pill box container is strong and easy to apply on natural or artificial nails,  an item exactly as described, I received my order too fast, packaged well and great price, I highly recommend these rhinestones  and i will buy again."

"This book was great.I will reread it alot. i bet anyone else who reads it will be a happy with it as i was!"
"The almost perfect mix of comedy, action, romance, and length. A solid choice for any mecha lover. Its not as much drama as eva but it works"
"One of the chain links was broken. Over all you get what you pay for. The gift box was a nice easy way to give it to my niece."
"So far I have not had any problem with the screen protecto. I would purchase another.  Love the fact I can't tell if I have a screen protector on my phone(very clear)"
"Love the iphone case but wish it had screen protector attach.  Took too long on the shipment. My son love the case too."
"I think it is enough for you using is very easy and also cleaning. it is worth for this prize"

"Do not buy seriously. Its like the worst material ever and it would fit a small kid. looks super cute in the picture but NO it is not cute on. I put it on and everyone of my roommates laughed historically its awful."
"charger didnt work and batteries are very weak.  the only reason i bought this was because my charging port is not working properly.  If you are having this problem i suggest you just buy a wireless charging pad cost about the same but works so much better."
"Best buy on Internet!!! Others offer same thing for far more. Was here in no time and exp was for 10 yrs from now which is great for prepping."
"Neither power cord that came with pump fit. This has got to be the dumbest product I've ever purchased, someone needs to be shot for such an oversight."
"I really like Netflix....very convenient and everyone in my family enjoys watching Netflix whenever they want. We are very happy."
"This was a very good read. It kept thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading the book. I hope that part 2 is even better.I recommended this book to a couple of very close friends."
"This movie was made with feeling and i liked how school friends ended up as lover and the fact that people thought that u can be gay from drinking the water was funny"
"This was one of my favorite. Movie i love the story line it was well written. Snd it made me fall in love with this women all over again"

"This is probably my favorite watch i own; it goes well with almost any outfit. Its a classy looking watch with a great face design; i love the fact that the black has a carbon fiber ish look to it as well the two sub dials which gives the face an even more intricate look. Functionality wise the watch is easy to read and chronograph works prefect too. All in all this is probably the best watch iv ever bought and the one that i wear the most often."
"I cleaned my belly button ring as soon as I got it and put it in. Because it was wet from the cleaner, the black paint on the bow came off and stained my stomach. If you decide to buy this ring, make sure it is dry before you put it near your skin"
"Really cute phone case, but very difficult to get off of my phone. Still cute and I'm glad I bought it"
"I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer of the right breast -- second time around for me after being cancer free for 16+ years.  A lot of great changes have taken place since my first surgery (1997), a lumpectomy and lymphnode excision followed by radiation; e.g. sentinel node biopsy (made standard of practice 1 yr. following my surgery); Oncontype DX test.  Through Dr. Love's Breast Book, I learned about the advancements made since 1997, and learned about the pros and cons of aromatase inihibitors.  One big change since my first cancer in 1997, is that chemotherapy is not always the adjuvant treatment of choice depending on the type of cancer.  I learned from Dr. Love's book that because I am estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and the fact that I am negative for HER-2/neu, my cancer would not benefit from chemotherapy.  This was confirmed by my doctors.  For these reasons and others, I have opted for a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  I have been informed that I will be admitted for only 23 hrs. following surgery, not the &amp;#34;few days&amp;#34; admission stated in the book.  That is the only thing in my experience I have found different from that presented in the book.  I found the book very beneficial in that it made me a more informed patient and therefore able to communicate better with my medical team."
"Grabbed me at the very beginning.  Loved the way the story unfolded, and loved the way the bad guy got nailed!  Only disappointment was it was to short and ended before I was ready."
"Easy to set up; use it for dog to get on bed.  Bought it in advance of an upcoming surgery that places physical restrictions on me, including not picking up my 10-lb. dog.  He loves to sleep with me and didn't want to deny him getting on the bed just because I won't be able to lift him for a time.  Was able to quickly train him to use by placing treats on the stairs, moving the treat up 1 step at a time.  Now, just need to direct him verbally to use the stairs by saying, &amp;#34;Stairs, Buddy&amp;#34; and he climbs up them without the use of treats.  He still likes to just jump down from the bed, but that's okay.  At least he's learned to climb up them without my assistance."
"This time you lose is one of those books that you cant stop reading.

"These nylon brushes fit great on my Dishmaster and they are great for scrubbing the hard stuff off of the pots and pans"
"T.E. Lawrence was a very reserved person, who was virtually forced to take the lead in the Arab revolt, to try and get some sort of sense, from the situation he found himself in.He was able to take advantage of his wide experience, for a young man, in the regional history and culture of the Arabs, to gain entry into their midst, without seeming too English. He had spent several years in Palestine and surrounds, studying the many Crusade Fortresses and general culture.He was also able to get a high level of Authority in the British side of things, through these same first hand and in depth experiences and because he was in the British Army already.Once he was able to get in contact with the Arab side, in the form of Prince Faisal, he had an amazing influence on the whole revolt, instead of only having a passive influence, as an adviser he took the lead and became in fact a very successful General soldier, leading his part of the war effort, by using Gorilla tactics, he was able to discomfort the Turks and force their retreatFinally he was able to take Damascus and if he had been able to unite the various Arab factions, he would have really changed history in the region, to the point that today would still have seen the effects he would have caused, but unfortunately that didn't happen and we are where we are now, because of British interference in Palestine, after the Arab revolt.Lawrence has given us an amazing piece of Literary work, that stands out in our 21st century as a beacon of what mankind can do, if he is working from a clean heart, not just for lucre.Lawrence also was a victim of his own success and fame followed him everywhere he went and with a certainty that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress, he had a bad time of itI believe that he could have very easily taken High Public Office after the war finished, had he been recognised properly for his work, but instead he gave us Seven Pillars of Wisdom."
"Well, I could not put the book down.  If it was really possible for an Amish man to be President, it would be a great day for our nation.  The values in the book Josiah had are exactly what the Amish believe and at one time the citizens of America had those same values, but they appear to be disappearing.  Oh how we need leadership like Josiah!!"
"it is a nice simple ring but it was not what i was expecting. the turquoise &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; was barely a stone at all.. i do wear it and its nice but i am still looking for another turquoise ring"
"It is very very slowDisconnects while tallking and it says &amp;#34;Sorry! ....has stopped working unexpectedly.Would you tell to HTC?&amp;#34; when i am teying to search my contacts."

"i was suprized by how soon i got the ring. it came about 3 days early. when i opened the package and the box the ring looked great. i picked it up and it was heavy witch i like. i would recimend this ring"
"Scottie was a great character in the original series and having him on Next Gen made for a perfect episode. The fact that original Enterprise crew didn't show up that often in TNG makes this figure an even better grab in my opinion."
"Anyone who is a Star Trek fan should own this figure.  Q is probably my favorite character of TNG as he was just such an entertaining character.  Q brought the series great plots and in many cases humor."
"This is an awesome series whether or not you're an anime fan. I used to watch this show back when it was on Cartoon Network (back when that channel had more shows I actually wanted to watch). If you're already starting to get into anime, this series is a can't miss."
"The cards I got were pretty well what I expected. All of them were in excellent shape. I loved that there were some cards that came from cereal box specials and others like that. It's a good buy for a kid or someone starting a collection. The only thing I have a problem with is that they didn't actually come in a card box."
"I like buying these groups of packs since they are a simple way to help bulk up my collection. Since the card companies jacked up their card production in the 80s and 90s there is plenty out there so collectors and especially beginners can start or expand a collection without busting a budget."
"This was one of my favorite Christmas presents this year.  After having a smaller digital frame for the last couple of years, this one made a huge difference in the quality of the pictures, even using the same pictures &amp; SD card as in the past.  Very easy to set up and use."
"This was an enjoyable, quick read. Feel good book for girls of all ages.Great story about friendship and commitment."
"Everything was to spec so it fit perfectly. We used it for our sailboats hot water tank. I searched for this product at other name brand hardware stores and this one was by far the cheapest for the same exact product. ...and shipped to my door! Can't beat that."
"This is a great value for a hepa, cyclone bagless upright. It was very hard to find all those things in a price we could afford and this vacuum works well.... Now if I could just find someone else to use it....it would be prefect"
"These are comfy, wick moisture, and fit very well with my vibram five fingers. I wanted them for the Fall, to run in cooler weather w/out freezing my tootsies off. I plan to get a pair for my ultra marathon running father in law. He wears regular sneakers, but these are great for blister prevention as well."
"These were very comfy, but run big and wide and therefor tend to slip at the heel. I returned them as the slip factor was a problem for me. Would make great house shoes, slippers etc."
"I wear these in Maine and often in deep snow, to hike and to take my boys sledding, clamming on the mud flats etc. they were very stiff and a little tight fitting out of the box, but after a few wearings they have proven to be very comfortable and warm. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that despite the cinch top, snow does come into the top of the boots. The top is fabric and snow makes it droop down and eventually gets your socks wet. This is only a problem if you are walking in snow over a foot deep. I solved that problem by wearing them under my pants in deep snow."
"These are definitely not my idea of slip ons. They are incredibly stiff and even though I sized up, I could not get them on my feet. I have never had that issue before. They are nice looking and have great tread and perhaps they would stretch? But I wasn't willing to deal with the discomfort to find out. Back they went."
"These are not lingerie, they are simple, comfortable stay put undies. Very thin. They do the job. I would not recommend putting them in the dryer."
"Not really sure that chia seeds need to be organic, however these are a good value and a good source of nutrition. We like our sprinkled on cereal. As a quick pudding in coconut milk and honey or to thicken pumpkin pie."
"It was exactly what I needed! Very good quality, blends in with other hardware in the bathroom. Thanks so very much!"
"when buying items (electronics) it is well worth the protection plan offered (square trade) is there to back up the product! if the event, i have any product issue."
"I've had this monitor for several months now, and it is great. The colors are crisp and clear and it is nice and bright. I can't see any light around the edges even when the screen is displaying something with a dark background.I plug it into my MacBook Air and use an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse to make a desktop out of my laptop. It works pretty good.P.S. I didn't buy this on Amazon, I bought this monitor at Best Buy, but it's the same monitor."
"I used these to tack my CAT5 cable [that I used to connect my Zmodo DVR to my router] against the baseboard. They work great and they come in a nice plastic container with a lid that snaps shut. The nails are pretty long so it's fairly easily to hammer them into wood or other material."
"over a year now and still going strong. not the most hi tech system in the world but they get the job done and keep my employees honest."
"I like these sandals but the strap is a little tight around the toe.  It may be because I wore them for the first time while out walking for a long day in DC.  They are super cute and overall comfortable.  I think if the leather stretches a little, I will be fine.  The sole is a little rubbery but it doesn't take away from the sandal."
"Easy to clean! A little difficult to keep folded but it's a great blanket. The fleece on the top is nice and thin, so it's not too hot but it can definitely keep your bottom warm when cool outside. I purchased it for my son's soccer games and we enjoy it!"
"Once upon a time, I bought a pair of this grey earbuds to use them when I'm outside and at school. When i first used them, I was shocked by the sound it delivered, even when I was outdoor. They have an EXCELLENT isolation from the noise outside. You put them on, press play and you can be in the middle of the traffic.... you WILL HEAR NO CAR. I also use them as ear protection when i'm in the workshop at school cutting wood with VERY loud machines. It protects your ears and also, the sound quality remains excellent.I've compared them with the Beats by Dre buds from a friend. Although the Beats cover very well the whole range of sound, the Skullcandy offer a more intense, powerful bass. It's like comparing the Monster's Studio and the Solo HD Dre headphones.They deserve the place in my heart for the best earbuds ever. However, I know that many people complain about the build quality. They lasted me 8 months... It's still a pretty decent run. They would have probably lasted more, but I borrowed them to some of my friends and they must have damaged the straight cable. One week after they returned them, my Left earbud was dead. My beloved Ink'd were unusable...To honor the best earphones that I had, I cut the Right one and put it on my key-chain. I really loved them.LESSON LEARNED: Never EVER EVER EVER borrow your headphones to anybody. Thrust NO ONE! hahahaLike all the stories that start with ""Once upon a time..."", this one has a happy ending too. I went to the store I first bought them and found them! It was the last pair, and I had to search for them a little bit, but there were finally mine again! This time is a black pair, that can't wait for the school to start. In my opinion, there are the best pair you can buy for the 20 (the price I here in Italy).Final judgement: THIS EARBUDS ROCKS!!!Cheers!"
"I have the Acer Aspire 7741G model with Core i5 (2.66 GHz), 6 Gb of RAM, 640 GB HDD and AMD Radeon HD 6550M. (It's the brother of this model)I bought this computer about 2 years ago. I'VE DID EVERYTHING WITH IT. I've even installed Mac OS X on it and IT WORKED.I am an architecture student and a freelance designer, so i need to run HEAVY software. AutoCAD, Photoshop, Illustrator, video editing, etc... it handles them like a charm! For multitasking, it's a great computer.For gaming... well, let's just say IT CAN handle new games (gta 4, assassins creed 1 to 3, COD MW 3 etc.) with no problems and graphics settings quite high, BUT it OVERHEATS... After some point, it ""black outs"" (shuts down and can't turn on for about 10 mins) for the heat. I've heard some people use cooling pads, but I haven't tried them yet.One thing i hate is the battery life... It's horrible! I can't even watch a full movie without recharging (in energy saving mode), but for me it's not a great problem. I almost always use it on a desk, so i really don't care that much.Anyway, in the long run, it's a pretty reliable machine. Only problem I had was with the HDD which was damaged (after i installed Mac OS and Win 7, and Mac OS and Win 7 for about 20 times). Most likely because of the repeated formats of the drive.THIS REMINDS ME I HAVE TO ADVICE EVERYONE ABOUT ONE THING: ALWAYS STORE YOUR IMPORTANT DATA ON AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE.I've learned my lesson when my first laptop crashed and i lost everything... Now for the grand finale.Pros &amp; Cons for this bad boy:PRO: very fast processor, good screen, full keyboard, reliable*, lots of memory, very decent graphics (for a laptop), will still give you at least a couple more years of good use.CON: LAME BATTERY LIFE, keyboard build**, needs more USB ports, build quality (made of cheap plastic... i'm always afraid to break it when i have to take it outside), design**** if you don't abuse it like i did** although i love a full keyboard, the type on this model it's awful. The perfect keyboard type is on the mac book pro's or the sony vaio's.*** i prefer other designs, but this is not the worse i've seen. Also, i don't like the back lid texture because my stickers don't stick very well. lol"
"This is a great video with three 20 minute workouts. I have been mixing it in with the 6 week to a 6 pack workout and love it! There is something very satisfying about kicking and punching and my boyfriend enjoys them too."
"Gave a good picture of how poor this area of the country was and how tied to the coal mines the people were.  The characters were interesting, had some flair. It was a good, enjoyable book."
"Thoroughly enjoyed Diva.  Description of the characters is strong and I began to see them well as the story unfolded.  Author did a good job making it seem that the story might go one way when it, in fact, went another. I enjoyed the way the author inserted the ""shadows"" theme. This was a fun read that I did not want to put down.  I am looking forward to the next book."
"This product is really cool. I enjoyed it a lot, when it worked. Unfortunately, this product obviously only has a lifespan of one month. After a month of use the water jets stopped working in the left speaker, I'm sure the right will follow here shortly."
"i bought it for my son. it`s good as described.  and cute cartoon on the bottle. my son likes it."
"This protects my iPhone5 very safe. Sleek and slim. Handy and sturdy. Saves my iphone pretty good.Worth and cheap."
"Moved the fan in our living room during a remodel and didn't like the way the sheet rock guys finished it off so decided to buy a medallion. This one matched my crown molding perfectly!  Easy to install."
"Very good quality. Color was what I expected.  Looks great in my newly remodeled bathroom! Would recommend to any of my friends!"
"when it arrived a month later it came broken worst product everi do not recommend you buying this product"
"It's exactly what I needed as my old bowl was cracked and leaking.  I've had my Cuisinart for 20 yrs and still enjoy using it"
"did not receive ubs,  cord as it stated it was included.  No instructions as how to get clock off military time and onto regular time. No instructions on how of program or search FM radio stations. I feel that the instruction manual need a LOT OF WORK. A little to technical for the average person with limited computer  tech knowledge.."
"its good i couldnt get free and it is also soft on the wrists i like it a lot :3"
"Great motivational book. Steve writes in very easy to understand concepts. Can't wait to start putting these principles into action."
"I guess I got what I ordered. Thankfully, I didn't pay a lot for it. I wanted to put it into a case, but the pin is clumsy and bulky."
"Got this for my kid's birthday party. Guests filled the tubes with little candies on the way out. It was a great big hit, the kids are still using them in their lunches to bring snacks to school."
"The holster is way too tight for my Glock 19. I can squeeze it into the holster, but when I try to pull it out, the whole holster comes with it. Not good at all. The holster is molded from one solid piece of plastic, and is sewn together. No way to stretch it out. If they put some elastic in place of the stitches, maybe I could use it."
"Just downloaded so not sure needed a hint so I had to rate this to get the free hint  so I not sur and nreed to type 20 words"
"This young-buck is going hard for the Lord on this one. And he's drawing the young crowd closer to God through his music. He even has an ole hip-hop head like me going hard."
"My only negative is that it moves so slow. The purchasing of the items and then having to wait so long for completion. I really like that it offers opportunity to earn the coins, so many games only offer the purchase of them, so that is a big plus. So if you make any improvements based on reviews I hope to see faster turn around on the game. :)"
"Best phone cases I have ever owned! I work for a railroad in a dust bowl and this case protects my phone even when it gets sand blasted... 10 times better than Otter"
"Does not let you pick the contestants row.  coins  you pick the first coin gives you the second one.  Out of three coins and so on"
"I have always wanted some of these feet, and I compared prices for each one and found out this is the way to get all I wanted for an incredible low price."
"Good update for news about Lady Gaga. Now I'm sure I do not miss anything this time!Updated more time in a day!"
"My daughter won't even wear it because it's too uncomfortable.  Also, the sizing is not accurate.  It is much too big."
"I have been adamant about losing at least 40 pounds since the start of the new year. I saw the details for this and thought that it could help me to start losing weight again . My goal was to lose a total of 55 lbs which I've been trying to lose . Before I stopped losing weight I had lost a total of 21 pounds. I hit a plateu of course but am now seeing pound for pound drop. No jitters for me was a plus."
"OMG - the grandson loves this app.  I can't play my own games when he's around because I constantly hear, &amp;#34;my turn&amp;#34;LOL"
"This boot fits true to its size. It's not too heavy but yet it keeps my feet dry and warm. I haven't used them in snow for hours at a time yet so I may revise this review after that.They are a nice boot to throw on with leggings because they aren't super heavy duty but they have enough fashion flare to wear them casually.The boots were exactly as pictured and shipped 1 day ahead of schedule. I would recommend these boots to others."
"Cute Peanuts book! I only wish I would have known that it's not totally appropriate for younger children, since the pop-up eggs in it could easily be torn out and eaten by curious little people! Cute story, though, just one that you will need to monitor younger children with as they read."
"Bought this puzzle for my son. He loves it, but it chips quickly with daily play. Just something to keep in mind if you're concerned about it staying in perfect condition."
"Cute toy, my son loves it! Expect the paint to chip and fade quickly, however. Wooden toys don't stay nice in the hands of kids! Otherwise, a great purchase and well-loved toy!"
"I am really disappointed in this product. It arrived utterly damaged. The decals/paint on the beads had mostly rubbed off and stuck to everything else (the tree base, other beads, everything), making a huge mess. Not only that, but it doesnt seem well-suited for a child to play with at all. Needless to say, I will be sending it back."
"i love it! it actually works too. it wasnt like reflective paper. it was nice not to have to think if i brought my mirror w/me, that i could just whip my fone out real quick n be done.  very useful invention for women!! it came in a couple days too. thanks"
"it was really cute and great while it lasted, however if your someone that drops your fone a lot..like me..it will break on ya in a few months of use. it did come quickly though. i just am either a little to clumsy or the quality is a little lacking. thanks"
"Fischer Price always comes through with great toys. The kids love these. Our small children like holding them and teething with them, they are a toy for all ages."
"I took the time to rate this because it is such an excellent cd.Chris just keeps getting better, he is already amazing."
"The only problem with this is I hate fennel and it's very strong in this litle bottle, when I do drink this I put a few drops into almond milk. Enjoy!"
"She loved it! The colors are bright and the case is made well. Will definitely purchase another one for my sister :)"
"This book has made me feel so much better! Ive been through a lot of testing to figure out whats wrong with me. I was terrified I had MS.. I started this diet because my blood tests showed I had inflammation and I figured it could only help. My chronic pain and cramping began to disappear. I lost 12 lbs in the first 10 days! The only complaint I have is that its a hard program to stick to 100%. I made a few minor tweaks to the recipes and gained. But as soon as I got back on it I dropped the gained weight quickly."
"This is the best book that I have read in two months and I read a lot. As a matter of fact this is the first book I have been inspired to write a review for. First of all I'm pretty savvy at figuring out the plots to these stories and although I was on the right track I didn't see it going exactly  the way it did. This book was incredibly intriguing, it kept me interested at every turn, I read it straight threw. Would love to read his POV. I don't put my stamp of approval on just anything but I will be sharing this author's work."
"Great product and service. The wife loves her new cookware, and I love the great food she is already making for me."
"The first time ordering with these guys, and will use again. The first order did arrive doa, I called them that day and was emailed a return slip, had it in the mail that same day and had a new one in less than a week. So Highly recommend."
"Great game great game. Yeah yeah yeah. Super. Like the really real thing. Play me. Yeah. Go homerun battle. Yeah yeah yeah"
"i have read most of the Bob Marley biographies, however the loving tribute from his mother exceeds the other accounts of Bob's life.  Bob and his mother remained close despite a multitude of trials and tribulations.  This book offers a perspective only a mother could provide."
"Gave this to my nephew for Christmas, along two other &amp;#34;guys&amp;#34;. He loved them all. Any guy with a hat..."
"SPOILERS INCOMING!!!It was a great book but a bit disappointing compared to all the other books because Artemis had the Atlantis complex and he so he wasn't coming up with his normal schemes and half the time he wasn't even Artemis he was that Orion guy who was really weird. All in all it just wasn't quite as intriguing as some of the previous books."
"excelente articulo, excelente vendedor muy puntual y cumple con las especificaciones solicitadas ! ! ! &amp;#60;3 muy bueno gracias ."
"I liked the case when I first received it.  It looks different from the usual cases and has a touch of bling.  However, the case does not stay in tact for long.  The edges started to fray, and the front orange flap is separating from the black backing.  This separation started happening after the first week or two of using it.  I predominately keep my phone in my purse or on a table (wherever I am).  So, it is not getting bounced around a lot.  I suppose I could glue it back down, and see how long that holds up.  I started cutting the extra white strands that periodically stick out around the edges.  But, I have to keep doing this because more strands come out.  I will shop for a more durable case next time."
"Love the options.  It has never, not worked properly.  This alarm clock app is very user friendly.  I have downloaded this app on all of my devices. I would recommend you do the same."
"I just bought this product its smell terrible like cigarettes, so sticky and greasy I had to watch my face right away.."
"great for anyone whos looking to learn or just to have something to review there very informative and handy hal leonard corp did very well"

"best controller for reason that is on the market the faders and knobs feel great and the lcd screen and keybed are the best not to mention the motorized fader great job by nektar"
"The rings arrived fast, and they are of great quality for cosplaying. I LOVE Katekyo Hitman REBORN, it is one of the best animes I will ever watch. All of the rings were excellent, and despite the first look, the Storm and Lightning ARE different. If you'll note the close differences. I didn't expect them to arrive in such an adorable case as well! I wanted to say thank you very much!"
"The figurines were all good, their faces were properly painted. They are the perfect size. Most of them fit into their stands... One of the black sticks didn't fit into the stand. Otherwise, the figurines themselves are very nice."
"Terrible doesn't even deserve a star. It's not even meant to fit the 5c phone if you have a screen protector . Got dirty with in one day"
"Great product!! Sticks on forever!! Would recommend it to everyone if you want a really long term sticker. Not even really like a sticker because it stays on SOO long:)"
"Loved it.... Done beautifully.... The characters, interaction between the servants and the aristocrats and the interaction inside the separate &amp;#34;ranks&amp;#34; was so interesting. Would hate to see it ever end."

"This product was recommended by a physician assistant for providing relief for nerve pain.  I haven't had the opportunity to try it yet, but it was new, shipped promptly and I can't wait to use it!"
"These are my first pair of compression socks.  I am using them to reduce swolling in a fractured leg.  I love the fact that the material is so nice, they look just like very nice trouser socks. They feel awesome on.  They are new and shipped quickly.  Follow the instructions for size.  I based it on the shoe size as suggested and was glad I did, despite the fact that I have very tiny legs."
"I have been using this product for years.  I recommend it highly. It lifts and firms around the eyes and  I see an instant difference when my eyes are puffy.  I've used other products with no results.  Everyone's tissue is different and not every product works the same way.  This product works great for me!"
"I really love this watch! It is simply and classy. Also, it is great that it never needs a battery! This will be my everyday timepiece."
"Loved it lol she is just like my mom it made my day to watch it. I love amazon prime lol"
"Commentary is easy to read and handy to have all of New Testament commentaries, by Wiersbe, in one hard bound book.  My husband enjoys using both OT and NT commentaries in his studies."

"I had 3 packs so farand it is one of the cutest things i've ever seen!it came pretty fast the first time I ordered one, but I didn't mind waiting a little more for the other two :)"
"It was what I was looking for. It was less expensive I thought. It was very usefull for my job."
"It was as expected.I liked it very much. It was usefull for me and not expensive at all. I recommend it"
"Since this book arrived  not a day has gone by without its pages being turned.  Our three grandboys love it as much as we do and have googled to find out more about many of the trees.  I am using it for inspiration for art quilts and the designs, colours and textures are invaluable.  I would highly recommend it.  It is a very special book indeed."
"I absolutely love this necklace! It looks like a very expensive piece of jewelry. Very believable! The low price was an added bonus!"
"I'm so sorry to write this comment, but this dress really let me down, never wear in winter, it is warm now, start to wear a week,  clothes SLV.opening and bottom cuff had a lot of hair bulb ball!!!,It is defective!!!(Ihave pictures)"
"This game is addictive. I could play this game all day every day if I could. Love it due to u can play with others and get more achievements as u go. If u love bingo this is most definitely the game for u. Love it"
"Works extremely well. This tool is durable and is an asset to my collection of Dewalt tools. I would recommend this to a friend."
"Works as advertised and was able to go through many projects with ease. I would definiately recommend this steamer to anyone."

"love the colors, matches the cover on the book. cant wait til it gets warm out and i can wear it. would recommend it to every hunger games fan"
"its better in person than in the pics. its so beautiful. i have had a lot of compliments on it"
"We have had this base installed for about a month now but the bathroom remodel isn't finished yet so we haven't been able to use the shower. It looks nice and the quality seems pretty good. Delivery took awhile but being such a large size the local stores didn't stock it."
"So far I like the case. It seems light and convenient compared to the previous cases I had for my old iPad. I do wish it had a screen protector built into the case. I haven't really traveled much with this one yet but the iPad Air and this case are definitely easier and lighter in my purse then the old one."
"The room is engaging and interesting. I wish it were longer with more levels and more intriguing puzzles. I'm looking forward to the next game from these great gamers!"
"Love the cables, not as long as i hoped them to be but that's my fault since i didn't know how high 6 feet was (I'm a girl) but the cables are nice, don't feel cheap, and doesn't break so easily like the cables i buy at walmart. Really good service, especially for a penny"
"I got this in the mail in 3 days and hate it. It won't let me play any games on ps2 even if i download it onto my ps3 and its a wired joystick. The picture is of a wireless joystick not wired. If i had know it was a wired joystick i wouldn't have bought it. It also feels like really cheap plastic. But otherwise on the actually performance on ps3 games its ok, no dual-shock though which sucks. But for the price it was at i will give you 3 stars"
"I got the item and its very cool but you have to be careful because its very fragile. I put a bunch of music on it and plugged it into my cars usb and it couldn't read it. I have never heard of different types of usb software but im sure ill figure it out. Like I said though,its not to be played with like a toy."
"This mask is pretty cool. I actually bought it for a friend of mine to wear when he plays the drums in his shows. He loves it. Like the other reviews said though the foam padding is kinda lame but im sure something else can be figured out."
"I actually bought this album as a christmas gift for my brother in law but I still like there stuff."
"Really a great read and thankfully not a full on love story. It was pretty well written except a few areas toward the end the paragraphs got a little confusing as to who's side you were reading about. I genuinely enjoyed the fact to that this starts after the wars and doesn't drag you thru anything but the necessary and important ones."
"This thing is awesome! Very easy to clean and maintain. Makes great tasting coffee/tea and or hot chocolate. The extra water reservoir is great. Can't go wrong with this one"
"The wedge was a nice idea, but the shoes, once I received them, appeared cheap both in make and materials.  The flower design was flimsy and looked as if it would easily be knocked off. Had to return. Usually I have good luck with Aerosoles."
"I wear these like house shoes. Incredibly comfy yet stylish. I bought them in every color and they have held up perfectly."
"I bought these batteries for my camera I was using for vacation. They lasted so long I could have got by with only 4 batteries. The only problem I have is they say they come charged but mine had to be charged."
"I gave the ratin g of 5 stars for several reasons. First it is a good size for a portable player, and fits in your hands comfortably. Second is the fact that it will play the regular DS games as well as the ones for the DS Lite. It is the only model that will play games for made for more than one model. The only thing I don't like is that it will not play all the newer games, but you can't have everything. In closing this is a well made system, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun inexpensive handheld video game system."
"I love this charger. When your batteries are fully charged not only does it tell you but it stops charging them, it even turns itself off after 9 hours."
"I would strongly recommend this product. It is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I wish it had clips to attach to camera instead of the way it does, BUT noone uses clips anymore. Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase."
"Not only does my wife like the color but she loves the way it attaches to her nook. It seems to be a quality made product that uses quality materials. It is so good that if I ever need to replace my cover we will see if they make one for my model of nook"
"This is a very good mild coffee. I drink my coffee black, but I need a coffee that is easy on my stomach. This is a very nice mild not to bitter coffee."
"Sexy, Twisted and Bloody! My favorite ending for this type of film!It was Surprisingly better than I had expected!"
"&amp;#34;Sex, The Breakfast Of Champions!&amp;#34;A classic rivalry, awesome story, capturing events.I expecting going into this movie for it to be a straight forward racing vendetta but, it was much more than that. Being based on true events made it even more intense, It showed hardship and reminded you of the dangers sports and for some people, taught you something about yourself.In competition and life, everyone can win."
"Although this book may not appear as good as its brothers it is really important to link the story together its a bit like the 4 book it has a serious twist which may ruin it in some views .This book is brilliant for the Alex Rider fan club it may get to.your head but be patient it will make sense eventually."
"This book is a fast paced and highly humerus this book proves the power of friendship and trust this is the book for any teen reader"

"Product works perfectly.  Shipped timely. I am very happy with the purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone who practices hot yoga."
"I bought this for my niece to use with her school iPad.  She loves it. It was reasonably priced and it works well."
"This product was shipped quickly.  Covers fit phone perfectly and 5 will last me a long time.  Overall I was very pleased."
"This item is reasonably priced.  It works well.  This will not protect phone from cracking as it is not padded."
"i like this cover , looks so preety on phone, it's hard plastic cover little fragile ... it slips so easily from hand ,and sometimes problem to reach at volume and power button ."
"I kept borrowing my mom's and sister's sandals so I finally got my own.  Very comfortable and a good fit."
"another hit by Fiskars!  this thing will cut anything that fits in the jaws!  the long handles offer great leverage!"
"The Anvils are of very high quality. i mostly use these to stamp lettering on keys. I will buy from again!"
"yea a few little wood chips but no big deal...  I was surprised at how large the bag is.. should last a very long time!"
"I don't see what others are complaining about.. maybe I got lucky.  Lights right up with a single match and is odorless and ready to use within a few minutes. .. yea it smokes n stinks when first lit but not a big deal....  one piece burns around an hour and a half."
"Nice Sling!  As advertised,  straps are long to allow broad range of adjustment and can be easily trimmed for custom fit.Only down side is loaded with buckshot and slugs it weighs a ton!"
"The quality is too general, I don't feel very good&amp;#65292;Feeling a little short&amp;#65292;Quality is really very general&amp;#65292;It's not worth the price"
"Well, yao also use, also don't know whether have effect, texture can still&amp;#65292;Waiting for the use effect&amp;#65292;Listen to the friend say is good"
"Terrible reception when  using both HDMI ports"
"Made in the USA ! Finally a product for babies not made in china. My daughter likes to try new foods in this"
"I love haba but for the price , not sure that the expected quality is there --- the stroller is great but the pillow/blanket / mattress are pretty cheap and lumpy. Tags say 'designed and quality of haba Germany' but do not explicitly state made in Germany.... Which leaves me thinking the fabric parts of this item were made at least in part in china , which is what I've been striving to avoid. The whole thing is supposed to be made in Germany but I've got my doubts about the fabric !  That being said, my daughter loves loves loves this stroller ! She uses it all of the time to help with walking. It's  very solid and durable , and came requiring minimal assembly.  It's really an adorable item and the stroller itself is heirloom quality. The stroller itself should get 5 stars but the cheap fabric knocks it down to a 4 star."
"and touch and try to hold it.  it's cute, soft, and thankfully an organic piece, so I don't care how much baby chews on it"
"My daughter loves this duck! She is 7 months and wants her duckie at all baths. It's cute and small. It doesn't sit upright , but it spends the bath in her mouth anyhow.  Be careful because it will get water in it- squeeze out the duck after each bath to avoid any issues.  Not made in china , hooray"
"These are cute and reposition well--- I went through a few remove and re-sticks and have had no problems so far."
"this can be worn well beyond 12 pounds, its much larger than it seems like it would be.  Can use later on."
"our daughter is long and I wanted something we could use for more than a few months.  This piece, while expensive, is not a purchase to regret.  Well made, soft and comfortable."
"Yikes. So sad that fisher price sold out and had this manufactured in China. Do you think that it's reasonably foreseeable that a baby will chew on this? Yeah, the manufacturer didnt think it was, because the cheaply painted portions of this remote are- wait for it- chipping ! And within 24 hours of giving this to my 9 month old. Have to take it away from her when I'm not on top of her watching her with it since I don't want her ingesting god knows what off of this thing. That being said , she absolutely loves the remote. I wouldn't buy again though.  I try to not buy things manufactured in China, when possible.  This purchase reinforces that decision."
"For the price I expected a better quality.  This is a very thin dress. not well made or something that seems like it would withstand multiple washings."
"the costume was exactly what I was expecting and it fit perfectly while looking awesome!! I got a lot of compliments for it."
"I bought this case because I needed something to protect my apple wireless keyboard when I throw it in my backpack. I found this to be exactly what I needed as it protects the keyboard while making it look awesome, I would definitely recommend it to anybody that has an apple keyboard and transports it from one place to another."
"I had the very well known issue with the N900 where the USB socket falls off which deemed my phone unusable for a few months until I came across this product, does the job."
"It wasnt what i was expecting but I will keep and maybe I can use later or find someone else"
"I couldn't put it down and when I had to, I couldn't wait to start reading again.  I'm looking very forward to book 2."
"absolutly love it....can't have enough quilting books......but this onetaught me a whole new way to make a quilt top....thank you"
"purchased for grandson......he is only 5 but we enjoy crafting together....he loves it and left it @ my house so he will have it when he comes for his sleepovers.....I predict many memories will start from this Art set....."
"I am still working on getting this program to work....I'm not very computer savy when it comes to these programs...  I followed instructions and got it downloaded but am unable to open up instructions....will have to call for assistance..."
"Absolutly love my brother sewing machine....I am 62 years old and my first sewing machine was a brother.......while I have has other machines throughout my life....I always go back to brother products........i have purchased a Brother Serger after this machine and am still learning what it can do........This company produces sturdy machines that are extremely easy to operate and service......I am not pricing  brother pe770 and looking @ the brother pr650....can't make up my mine how deep I'm going to plunge.....One of the best features of the HC1850 for me is that you can operate the on /off function on the machine without using the foot pedal.....I have problems with my legs and hips and constant use of the foot pedal is painful for me.....I can sew much longer with the switch on the machine....Thanks"
"The Snugg does fit the iPad3 perfectly as advertised.  I love the hand strap and have used it several times for work (this was one of the features that led me to buy it).  Although I haven't used it yet, I also like that it has a stylus holder on it as well.  The case seems very durable and I would recommend it to others."
"I must say it is very easy to find any verse or chapter in the bibleI would recommend this purchase for everyone"
"When they first came I was a little disappointed that they went plastic but it but if you work out better I will definitely order these again and tell everyone I know that they really work"
"I seem to have very good luck with this company I'm going to continue to buy they make the cutest sets thank you"
"I bought this for my wife! I was happy this came in so quick! Thank you for the speedy service! She has wanted this movie since she was a kid!"
"It's beautiful and even shinier and more sparkly in person. It seems like its good quality. I have only had it for a week. I am hoping the gold doesn't tarnish quickly."
"Easy, portable, good sound, but the battery only lasts about 3 hours."
"The first book in a series that is far more worth than the money you spend, as well as the time it takes to read. I highly recommend it to any dark fantasy reader. If you're a little squeemish, and can't handle a gory fight scene or two I'd say walk away right now. If you don't mind a little blood and viscera, read it! It's worth the time, and I'm confident you'll buy every other book in the series and not regret it for one second :)"
"I loved the book, and while it was a tad bit short (2 sittings...) I find that I got attached to the characters rather fast, and wanted to know more about them. I didn't like the ending however, seeing as it was kind of sudden. I could see it coming, but I went to the kindle store to get the second book in the series, but either they don't have it, or it isn't out yet. Either way, I can't wait for it! It's pretty cheap, but for being so short I would expect that. 2.99 is a good price though. Just hope the next book won't be any more than that. (Unless it's a couple-hundred pages longer :P)"
"I decided to buy the paperwhite over the other kindles for the main fact that it's simple. Maybe not so much as went into designing it, but the use of it, the way it performs and everything. No frills, no gimmicks. It's simple! And I absolutely love it! I've already read 5 books on it in the 4 weeks that I've had it. Living in a small town means that there's not any bookstores. Nor is there any good ones within a miles drive. So convenience was a definite factor, and the Kindle Paperwhite provides that, (much like the other Kindle products I'm sure). Did I get what I payed for? Absolutely, and a lot more than I expected, and being an Amazon product I expected a lot ;)"
"A very complicated book,  that I don't really feel was intended just for the average reader,  although,  I can't allow my own lack of knowledge over the subject affect my review. This book I about exactly what it states,  a voyage in a balloon,  I came into it believing it was chronicling the voyage of the men who landed on the island in the book &amp;#34;The Mysterious Island&amp;#34;... It doesn't,  not even close,  still,  it was an interesting read,  and worth the time spent on it."
"For being free it was a great book. If you want a quick little read that's a little creepy then go for it!"
"It only took me 20 minutes to read it, and it was surely worth it :) It was a tad bit confusing at one point, but at the end I tied it all together, and had a good laugh! Definetly would recommend it."
"If you think you may want to read this book, do it! It's well worth the time it takes to read it. The story is original, the characters likable and an easy to follow read. The writing can get a little rough, but the imagery is usually pretty good, and you get a good idea of what everything looks like, and it leaves just the right amount to the imagination. I'm not going to ruin the story by nit-picking every scene, read if for yourself and form your own opinion."
"I don't want to seem like a fanboy of Dalglish, but I do have to say that I've absolutely loved every book he's put out that I've been able to purchase. The Paladins series was one such case ;) These are books that you would rather not put down. I found myself easily reading for 4 hours straight or more, and feeling like barely an hour had passed. I found it easy to lose myself in the story, which is well written, and filled with conflict :P  As another reviewer stated, you find yourself liking one character, and then disagreeing, then pitting them, then wanting to change their course of action. After it all, you see it pan out to an ending that you may or may not like, but hey, that's what I love about Dalglish, he's not afraid to do what must be done. The books can be gory at times, (which gives it a sense of reality) there isn't any chapter long sex scenes that you'll have to worry about either :P I would recommend these books to any person who enjoys fantasy novels, and doesn't mind a little grit every now and then."
"Liked the book.  Kept your interest.  Characters were good and interesting.  Would recommend."
"Game is another option of using the Kindle.  If you tired of reading or watching videos you have the option of playing games.  Play the games when we travel.  Makes time go by faster.  B"
"The book is a great resource for anyone interested pottery mold making and slip casting. A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for all potters!"
"it works very good - good reception good soundthe only thing is the one i had before this - the head piece was adjustable and this one is not - so it is a little big for head and i always feel it is falling off. Other than that i like it alot.nancy norris"
"Great pillow !!!!!"
"I have been doing iOS programming for over an year now and I picked up this book just to refresh my objective c concepts. But I must say I learnt a lot of new things as well as got new perspective of things I already knew."
"I like it, except there is ventilation. I get all sweaty even when it's little cold outside. Can not wear it much in SF bay area."
"Broke my laptop screen and this made it like new again. Great clarity and size. Saved me the hassle of getting a new laptop"
"It only grips for a few minutes then my phone falls right off. Works better after cleaning, but has started to leave a sticky residue behind."
"Fits perfectly and the details on the back are great and give the phone a little grip on smooth surfaces."
"The highs, mids, and lows are perfectly balanced. There is no way you could make these any better in terms of sound. Sure, they don't look as good as the beats pro's, but they sound 1000x better. No competition."
"Really enjoyed these books. Would make for a great movie too, reminded me of the Twilight series. Can't wait to go back and read it again."
"This item wasn't what I thought it wasy. It wasn't made well but I have it now so I will make sure I read the description next time"
"Not really a compelling story for me. Disappointed to learn that the author did not have first-hand knowledge of the culture or the era in which the story was written, and the descriptions become repetitious starting about halfway through the book."
"Sorry to see the shoulder area ends very short of the average female figure.  it is hard to fit a blouse or top if you don't have suffucient width there, as this measurement is cricital to a good fitting garment."
"Good story by K.J. Taylor!  I look forward to reading more of her books in the near future with their well made story line."
"This made it so easy to take our parrot on a road trip and he was comfortable in it.  I'd recommend it to any small parrot owner."
"This hair was perfect.. I haven't used it yet but I was able to match it with my hair and it looks perfect.."
"why are you still reading reviews? go get this game and never look back youll LOvE every minute of it"
"I was skeptical of the product actually working but after the first use the top side of my 2001 Sea Ray looked 100% better. I applied two more applications and the shine and sheen of the top side of the boat looks like brand new. Used in conjunction with the Pro Polish I can actually see my reflection in the gel coat. I would highly recommend for heavily oxidized boats!"
"While it's not the game I remember, it's still a bit of fun. If you've enjoyed games like frontier ville you'll probably enjoy this. Could use an easier energy refresh."
"This simple game is addictive fun and reminiscent of brain training games I have played in the past. While the concept is easy to grasp the game remains challenging and only grows more so."
"Thank you a lot Steve for being so honest about your life experience on a trike. This book is a must be for someone who is planing a change of life, another perspective of traveling around the world ."
"I really liked this book. The mystery reveals itself towards the end.  The story line of the two children captures your heart and helps you to understand the philosophy of forgiveness."
"The headset itself is very compatiable with my phone, but the earbuds are made of a hard plastic and very uncomfortable."
"works perfectly...i would recommend this charger to anyone.i can plug my phone up when i get in the car and know that i will have a full charge"
"This book is up to the usual standards of Debbie Macomber's books and I'm hooked on all of the Cedar Cove books she has written."
"Great item, but should come with installation instructions....bottom part of backseat does not have holes for seatbelts and I couldn't use it in my Mitsubishi Eclipse but the item itself is awesome and definitely displays my Steeler pride!!! :)"
"All my friends get a kick out of these! They are a great conversation piece.  I absolutely love them.  They arrived within 3 days of ordering them."
"Loved this book, the kind you can't put down.  That being said, the ending was weird .  Unresolved is how I describe it."
"i love my ring! but wondering if there is a wedding bad that goes with it!?my boyfriend just proposed on christmas day! we are planning on getting married when he gets back from deployment in 2015!"
"Love my new phone"
"I regret I bought this laptop. So may things work wrong. Wifi disconnects so often than sometimes I have to connect it few times an hour. Touchpod doesn't work well as well, usualy have to press few times to open what I want. My old HP was much better.What is funny, just after opening Vaio for the first time, I got the notification that I already have 333 errors in the computer which make the computer work slow and if I wanna fix it, I have to buy special program. Are they normal? I spent more than a 1000$ for that piece of crap and they do that to a new laptop? No way. It's slow, so many times it's just suspended and websites don't respond. Few times Windows was completely not working, even restart didn't work. Maybe I just had a bad luck with Vaio, but I WON&amp;#34;T recommend it to anybody, Invest your money somewhere else."
"I have received the Squeeze &amp; Teethe Lamb from Infantino to facilitate my review.&amp;#8221;My 2 month old son loves this lamb.  It is easy for him to grab and he smiles every time he sees it.  The soft material is perfect for him to suck on.  I am excited to see how he plays with the toy once he gets older.  This is his go to toy at playtime!"
"It is very slimming and it looks absolutely adorable on! It is worth every penny. i would buy in every color if they had it in every color!"
"Unit works as advertised. Plug it in and the computer recognizes it. Using windows 7. Using it on the front usb."
"Excellence! Weight forward design is aggressive. This hammer has its weaknesses,  but every hammer does. I've rarely needed another, nonspecialty, hammer to complete any given task. I prefer(as do most other experienced carpenters/contractors/handymen) to keep a spectrum of nail bars to back up all hammer use and I've found that this practice counters virtually every blind spot this hammer has. I'm extremely happy with this hammer.I actually bought this one to replace one like it that I'd somehow lost after about 10 years of heavy use. Demolition, finish, rough framing, chiseling, some engine work, fencing. I miss my lost one :'("
"Sold and shipped by amazon.I love the way this thing fits! If feels amazing. It is truly fully adjustable with hook-and-loop shoulders and 3 adjusters on each side around the waist. I've worn it practically every day for a month with no accessories(to poor to afford everything I want in one order).I'm a maintenance/facilities management guy and I was tired of running back and forth for things and saw this as a way to fix that(excellent idea, by the way. I think all trades people should have something like this).within a week, stitching began loosening in the molle loops. All I've used it for is a caribiener with keys(35 keys, to be fair). One loop came out completely just before I received my first accessory pouch(Condor). Don't plan on taking this to the battle front. Weekend use for airsoft/paintball/hiking, maybe. I am looking and may spend around 100on something better in near future. (P.S. I thought the hydration bladder pocket was a plate carrier, shhhh, don't tell anyone, it's embarrassing!(Update:05/10/13) I've loaded the vest down with 15 lbs of gear, including my CamelBac and 3 tactical pouches. I've run, jumped and moved heavy items. I haven't yet improved/repaired/reinforced the molle webbing (and it needs it) but it seems to be holding up pretty well. 40 hours a week plus, wearing this, the wide flat shoulder straps are starting to cause slight blunt discomfort in the contact area(no chafing though).I'm still of a mindset that this could NEVER hold up under real combat conditions."
"It does what it's supposed to. This isn't a complicated item. It's simple. The snap closure is really tight and definitely needs a tight leather belt to be secured to. If you have a bit of ""belt hang over"" your body type might make it difficult to access. It's hard to pull a lighter out if any angular pressure is put on it. You must slide lighter strait out. Good product!The snap broke off."
"i was really excited about this item. It came in the mail, i fueled it up, played with it quite a bit. Loved it. Today, a week after I bought it, it somehow came loose from its lid and fell somewhere . I'm very sad :( . It probably would be better with some kind of latching design so it doesn't get lost easily.  I don't have anything bad to really say about it. It's great. :("
"I use this as a free standing first aid kit. I bought it for my hydration MOLLE vest, but I ran out of need for the vest and so use the pouch independantly. I really like this pouch. I've got an ammo pouch on the front netting for batteries. (Next purchase, recon vest)"
"Iin my job as Head-of-maintenance(fancy for&amp;#34;I fix stuff&amp;#34;) ,I carry about 50 keys at all times. I kept getting more keys(still getting more) and needing bigger key rings. As title suggests, I got a large split ring hoping it would solve my problems. It began stretching and distorting. It was difficult to remove and replace keys(as for copying at the locksmith's) and I got fed up and started looking for new options!I found these on Amazon and decided to give them a try. (They arrived early and well packaged) before I'd finished putting all my keys on these new tools, I threw away the split ring, realizing that this was my answer!  I have better accessiblity. I use multiple cables looped on a carabiner and am able to categorize the keys for easy location and it has had the un forseen bbenefit of being more comfortable.The only cons I can see are the screw couplers on the ends. They come unthreaded(unscrewed) periodically and all the keys fall onthe ground.  This is a simple thing to counteract. I put a small bit of tape on the male end when I screw them together. This adds a little needed friction. There are other substances and materials one could use to do the same job."
"If you are believer this book will change your life.  It is beautifully written and the exercises have changed my life.  This book is totally channeled from the angels.  Everyone should be required to read this book."
"Good ... I like the fit and feel very comfortable.This needs some more warmth as when you wear that in Cold conditions does not protect you completely."
"This protector does not give enough protection to the phone and there is no snug fit. The inside of the case does not have any cushion that could fit properly."
"some parts are cheap looking but it will be cute on him."
"love them."
"Very sturdy and comfy"
"bought them for a friend"
"love the color and it looks nice on it."
"Fits well"
"Perfect to display or to store overstocked frames. Good quality...very comparable to frame display vendors, but at considerably lower cost."
"I am hoping this is a good book it was given as a gift ! The little girl that asked for it also asked for the movie!"
"OMG!! I hate the thought of this book being over and having to wait to get the next book! I'm so wanting more!! Hot hot hot!"
"Loved it and I want more!!!  Please hurry I need to know more! Can't wait for the next book !"
"These books were very good short and fast but still very good! I have already told friends it's a must read!"
"The book was pretty good and I'm looking forward to the next book to see what is going to happen! So I think I'm going to read on!"
"I loved the Roamones as does my boyfriend.  So this was a great Christmas gift for him.  The disc came in the same condition that was advertised and we had a great Christmas day rocking out to some great music."
"The bibs are nice in themselves, seem to work just fine although they are a bit thin, but they did not fit around my 18 mo baby's neck. Would be best for a younger/smaller baby."
"Great read! I could not put this down for a second. Can't wait to read the next book! Loved it!"
"Easy cleaning, light weight and charming... Love it. Good, Good, Excellent and excellent. I don't know what to write anymore."
"It is a very good cup. The only problem is that the cup came a little lose from the handles."
"Have long been fascinated by history.  Had read &amp;#34;The Paris Wife&amp;#34; and was interested to see the common denominator between the two novels and their protagonists.  Brought that era to life, and defined how easy it was to become lost in debauchery.  Very entertaining!"
"its a great keyboard but the keys were all spanish and the packaging was banged up pretty good. also i had to wash the keys after unboxing."
"Omg, I love love love this book. At every turn it got more enticing . Im looking forward to ready more."
"I totally love this book .... i cant wait to read another one!! :) I hope you continue in this route."
"Pretty set but too simple, not enough shine or luster except for the middle stone. Nice but I'd recommend the heart shaped set by Berricle instead. Wonderful shipping but I think I'm going to return."
"This dress is not meant for the shy and modest girl. This dress is very sexy with it's open key hole neckline so if you don't like showing cleavage, do not buy this. The material is a simple cotton/poly/spandex so there is stretch to this. I'm 5' 6"" and I weigh 140lbs (36-29-40). I read a lot of reviews talking about how this is cut small but I disagree. I ordered a large but really a medium would have suited me better. I'll keep it as sending back to China would be more of a hassle. I do have to say, I was VERY impressed to have received this dress one week after I ordered it! I wasn't expecting it til mid May.  I'm very pleased with this dress and feel super pretty in it. I'd definitely recommend a good push up bra and spanx to go underneath and really bring out the desired effect. This would make a great first date dress, just broke up with my boyfriend dress, or girls night out dress. It's light weight so if you're on the dance floor, you won't sweat too bad and if a drink is spilled on you, it will absorb quickly...win, win. If you're thinking about buying this, do it...you won't regret it as long as the sizing is on point."
"I bought this dress because I love the cross cross vintage style neckline but let me tell you this dress looks like a mess from the waist down. The nice slits you see in the pic...nope. The dress looks like a square flap hanging between your legs and is very unflattering. I took it immediately to the dry cleaner to get hemmed. We'll see how it turns out. It's 100% polyester. Too much of a hassle to send it back to china. My measurements are 5' 6&amp;#34; (36-29-39) and it fits fine but cheaply and poorly made."
"Legs and iron holder are made from some kind of metal but board is from some kind of cheap plastic and broke after 3 or 4 times use. It was arrived in a great shipment condition. During this two months, I have used it for only a few times and then I found out that something wrong with the board. After I open the fabric cover, I saw that the board is broke. Never fall or hit with something because the leg is very strong. Don't waste your money."
"This is a fantastic book about the struggles of an American hero and patriot.  I would recommend everyone read this book."
"I am amazed he is still alive.  Classic book I have referred to kids in the past and it's still relevant for today's at-risk juvenile.."
"Adequate, but nothing to write home about. It's a mid-range product. This takes out small scratches and not tar or paint marks/scratches."
"I am so excited I ordered this bike.  I was very hesitant but I am so happy.  Order it, its great fun!"
"My 11 year old daughter found this on Amazon.com and since we have an account wanted me to order it for her new iPad mini.  When we received it, she instantly tried it on her iPad and to this day loves it.  I am ordering another one in a different color for my other daughter who just got her own iPad mini."
"I normally wear a size 61/2. All the reviews said that they run big so I ordered a 6. They fit PERFECT. Unlike the old Dr. Martens, the leather is very soft and comfortable. The sole is not as prominent as the old Dr. Martens which makes them less bulky looking. I wore this boot all day when I received them. This is definately a must have if you want a good looking and VERY comfortable boot. Shipping from Amazon was super fast also."
"This book provides pathways for action provoking thought processes to enter your life. I've enjoyed the stories told in the book as well as the changes I've made in my life. It's an easy read that gives as much wisdom as a tough read does."
"I have been using this hat for a couple of weeks and really like it.  It fits well and looks really cute.  I like that it is crushable and that I can take it with me in my bag. The quality of the hat is very good."
"I just received the dictionary today after placing the order more than one month ago. I visited the post office to check the package by myself and I could finally got it. Around 100 pages were in shrink condition that I have to put them back into their right place. I wonder where those pages started to shrink; is it from the packaging point or at the checking or customs point?.While reading the words and their definitions I found that they are very clear and understandable. Everything almost as perfect as I've been expected to. However, there are things that caused me to conclude that it is only a four starred dictionary. The first is the paper which is too thin, which is easily torn apart. Secondly, there is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Thirdly, I need more encyclopedic definitions about some worldly events like the 9/11 2001 in New York. In my opinion there should be a picture of the ""late"" twin towers along with the list of suspects, both individual and organization, and more detailed story about what exactly has happened in the 9/11 event. But most of all, it is a quite satisfying dictionary which must be collected by everyone who is serious in English."
"It is a good dictionary with an old fashion performance. There is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Words in the addenda should be inserted into the existing entries. The typing is more like my grandfather's first dictionary printed in Netherlands in 1950s. However, there are some specific elements to let me justified that it is a four starred dictionary. The first is the abundance of word entries which is not found in any other dictionaries. Secondly, the amazing printed size book, which caused other people to think that I might be a great lexicographer while carrying the book. Thirdly, it has been the dictionary of my dream since I was in secondary school. What a subjective reviews!!! I recommend you to have one if you are serious in exploring English through words."
"Wasp Freeze really works.  It seems like professional strength.  It kills wasps and hornets on contact.  Just spray it on the nest at night when the wasps and hornets are in the nest, they will come out of the nest already dying.  Keep on spraying and they will die within a couple of seconds.  You can spray from about 6 ft. to 10 ft. away from the nest.  It sprays in a fairly heavy stream, not in a mist.  I also killed a big spider with it.  I highly recommend this product.  It is worth the money."

"The Saferest California King mattress and box spring encasements appear to be durable and good quality. I cannot comment on how long they will last because I just bought them.  The micro zippers appear to be good quality and have velco covers at the end which appear to be effective.  They fit the mattress and box springs well, and the mattress encasement has a nice soft terrycloth top. I am completely satisfied with these encasements at this point."

"This book kept my interest from beginning to end. What I liked about the story it showed the human side and it gave you the spiritual side which was sound. It  is a must read. Well written."

"An interesting read. Story line was definitely different and was a clean story but still that kept it real.Not bad."

"What is this a college textbook?  $80 for a softcover and the pictures are in black and white!  You can't even read a few of the pie charts because they are in black and white and you can't decipher 6 different shades of gray....The content is decent but there isn't anything in there that the million other Lean books don't have, it's just in the context of emergency services and priced 5 times as much.Basically the professor (Dr. Noon) saw an opportunity to partner with an ED physician (Dr. Crane) he had in his MBA class to take the same material that is in every other lean book, put a different context around it then price it like other professors price their text books."
"It is a wonderfully illustrated book. I purchased it for my 88 year old mother-in-law who does a lot of knitting and crocheting for kids in hospital etc. I think the children will enjoy Amineko"

"Stephany Tullis has created a vibrant read with well-drawn characters that we've all seen in our respective houses of worship! It's refreshing to read a work that shows how faith links the Master's plan to the master plan described in the novel, and the big reveal at the end was worth waiting for. I'm looking forward to the sequel to see just what happens to Pastor Woody and the flock!"
"I purchased this along with a necklace and my girlfriend loves it. The only problem is that it's a bit big on her. She may have lost some weight, but the ring still fits well and is easily taken off. A great buy overall."

"My mates use this type angle drill  bit holder for at least two - three years, and it still drives almost perfectly as the first day. We drive it with impact! driver, and we use it every day. Roughly 10-15 hours per week. I use to have cheaper copy of this product and it lasted me for two days! Than it simply fall apart. This is definitely product for tradies! It can get better than this."
"Haven't seen a tougher tool box in my life.Really heavy duty.You won't regret if you buy this product."
"After almost a month of owning it, I'm thinking seriously to return it.I bought it mostly 'cause I needed an USB microSD reader for my son's R4, so I thought it would be nice to charge my smartphone as an added bonus to the reader. That part works quite good, I'm using it to charge my Bluetooth headphones to with no problems at all.The problem comes from the reader itself. When you put on the microSD card inside it, it stays on its ""Slot"" but when you place the reader into the USB port on the computer, the port seems to push the microSD card further inside the reader and then one of 2 things can happen: Either the PC doesn't know that the reader has a card inside it (You see the reader but not volume in File Explorer) or it DAMAGES THE microSD CARD!. Maybe the reader that I got is broken somehow but after inspecting it, I think it's a design flaw. It doesn't seem to have any way to stop the SD card from going further inside it AND it is a real pain to remove the card from the reader, I had to use a needle like for 2 minutes to take it out. It damaged my daughter's 16GB microSD card from her phone and an old 2GB microSD that I had lying around, which was not big deal (My daughter WAS!). It was literally burnt, I almost burn my fingers taking it out from the reader due to heat.I live in Venezuela and it certainly took a long time to come here, I bought it with some other things and I haven't read the return policies yet. I'll edit this when I found out more about this.So, in conclusion:1.- Fine charger, works as advertised2.- Very bad USB reader, but had to be used carefully.PD: I failed to mention that it worked fine on my sister's laptop but all the bad things happened on my PC. But the SD removal issue, happened regardless on where I used it"
"I purchased two of these.  Both my son and daughter loved them.  Very portable, as in room to room, and to take anywhere."
"I do like the set, but used it to punch a pin and one light tap and head broke.  All the other in the set have been good."
"I only started reading a year ago and fell in love with the bet....It's hard to find a sequal just as good if not better. I found myself crying, LOL, and couldn't wait to find out what was next.

"This album really gets at the heart of what Christmas is about- the good news that God came to redeem us. There are certainly traditional elements in the album, but there are a refreshing amount of upbeat, wonderful new melodies, as well. This is a must-have album for someone looking for &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Christmas music, or Christmas music done in a new way."
"But then again, it came in time for Halloween.  I love H2 (1981) and this package delivers.  It has a gang of xtras and a filmed episode of Horror hound's hallowed grounds (Halloween 2) for those that reads horror hound mag which is awesome.  The tv cut is cool but its edited!  That's what I thought at first but then my friend said it wasn't edited just added footage and whatnot.  So i got my hopes up for the tv cut being extra sweet but it is wht it is, a tv cut.  Nevertheless, it still brings back memories of watching it on television.  A must own for horror hounds and Michael Myers enthusiasts!"
"I love it as it has a wonderful taste. I drink it in the morning and sometimes I wish I could drink it at night as well."
"This product is awesome. Ive been using it for only a week now and I already see results! I had been looking for an eye lash grower for a while now, and they all seem to either be unsafe or ridiculously expensive. This product however, I couldn't be more happier with! They have my business and will continue to have it."
"This is a very nice pendant. I bought it for my wife because it has both our and our sons birth stone. It's really tough to estimate actual size online, and I will say this is a little smaller than I hoped it would be. But still a very nice piece of jewelers."
"I bought these for my wife because they have both our and our sons birth stones in them. Tad small, but for earrings that isn't always a bad thing. Very pretty. Recommend."
"Love this phone, I only have 1 line but it has 2. No answering machine, but who needs that when everybody has voice mail. I bought it because it has a headphone jack, and I also bought the Panasonc KX-TCA60 and those work wonderfully with this phone. Great phone, recommend."

"This book, using valid research, explains why the cycle of poverty is so difficult to break and gives many stories about the issues that people in poverty must deal with on a daily basis.  The middle class unwritten rules do not apply inpoverty.  Patterns of speach, thinking and discipline in poverty are different than in middle class.  Any educuator or law enforcer should read this book."

"I love these and they are perfect for summer.  I was a bit worried when i saw other reviews of how these pants run small.  That is not the case with me.  I am a size 8 through and through and these fit perfectly.  I love them so much i just ordered a pair in black.Update:  Just received the black pair and they are just as great as the tan pair.  They arrived even quicker than i expected.  Excellent company to purchase from.  They were so friendly and even emailed me personally to thank me for my order.  You dont find that kind of great customer service very often these days.  I HIGHLY recommend!"
"I bought this not knowing how the juniors large would fit but its perfect!  I'm usually a woman's medium and this fit like it was made for me.

I just ordered the teal color as well.  I cant wait for it to arrive."

It is a story in a series that has kept me reading for the last six months so that should tell you that it is good because if it wasn't good why would I wait for the next one and buy it as soon as it comes out.

"I just got done reading this book.  I'm crying and just wow.  There is so much I want to say but I won't.  All I will say is read this book.  The only part I didn't like was the prologue.  It was just wow.  Loved Parker in this, he was so great.  Anyone that has gone through cancer or seen someone with it knows how hard it is.  I want to thank Amanda for giving us such a great book."
"I read a review that said they didn't like the book that much because there were paragraphs that repeated.  I didn't see that.  I liked this book a lot.  It was a fast read.  Very good."
"Sins and Secrets tells the history of the city in which events took place. This adds a learning factor to the show. Very enjoyable. This was a factor I enjoyed about another series called City Confidential."
"Fantastic choice of old movies and cartoons. Brings back the  memories. Also enjoyed the puzzles. Harder than they look. Recommend."
"This book is one of the best nude photography work compendium of all times. And its just volume 1. Cant wait to see the rest."
"It serves its purpose. Isn't super strong neither weak. Can't resist an impact or a high drop but to protect and storage equipment ain't bad."
"Its ok I guess for the price. However, it is hard to iron, has so many wrinkles that if you don't play with the lights will show up in the pictures. Besides that, everything else is fine."
"Exactly what I want it. Highly recommended. Good quality product. I used it many times and it serves it purpose (impressing my wife ) :)"
"It can store food around 5 hours without any problems. Great price with fantastic experience. must have it for lunchbox at work or school"
"If you are looking for a great way to cleanse - this would be the product. I started off with using 4 capsules, but read some other reviews stating that 2 is really all you need, I utilized 2 a day and still had good results. I will probably purchase this item again."
"The storage unit is nice, and I love that it is stackable. I bought these to organize my garage. The only negative thing I would say is that these storage containers are expensive. You can get cheaper stackable units at Walmart."
"Great recipes with a nice variety of options! I watched the show then bought the dvd. It was very eye opening, and I plan to use the juice guide to start juicing."
"So glad I bought the costume! The only down side about the costume is the sizing.  I'm 5'5"", 138lbs...and i usually wear medium. Since they didn't have just a medium i went with the med/lg and it's def a little big in the chest area, so I wore a light blue tank top underneath it and it was perfect!  The zipper wasn't an issue for me at all.  All you need to do is fluff up the skirt when you get it.  The hood was in great condition, that just needs a little fluffing up too. You def need to get the leg warmers with the costume.  I wore this to a halloween party and everyone loved it!"
"Ian is a true inspiration and hero!  Words can't describe the power of his music.  His life was cut way too short, but I truly believe God had bigger and better plans for him that this earth could just not fulfill.  Instead, he is a guardian angel who now watches over other young men who stand to lose their life.  It can happen to anybody at any time.  EARLY DETECTION!!  Buy his CD and the book, Together We Will Win, by Karen A. McWhirt.  His story needs to be out there!!"
"This book started out fast. Then it kind of slowed down. It picked back up(a little bit), but I kind of feel like it's dragging. The good part is, it keeps you interested, and want to continue reading. So, with that being said, I guess I'll wait for book two."
"THESE R GREAT. CAN&amp;#34;T DO WITHOUT THEM. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU&amp;#34;RE TRYING TO PLACE A CALL ON YOUR CELL PHONE &amp; U HAVEE LONG NAILS. NO MORE USING MY KNUCKLES. YIPPEE!!!!!!"
"i'm not really a video poker player. its good for those who enjoy video slots. IT WILL KEEP U OCCUPY."
"This is the first game I brought for kindle fire. I love it. Its alot of fun. Its really easy to play. Very surpise!!! Loving it."
"This is the first time that I'm playing this game on my Kindle Fire Hd. I'm REALLY enjoying it. Seems to be a little easy. I'm waiting for it to pick up. Loving it!!"
"I just love this game. I brought the first edition of Cooking Dash and played it so much, I went to the Challenge mode. Love that one too. I play every chance I get. Can't get enough."
"Once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Zombie fans like me will definitely enjoy it. The story is plausible and the zombies are more realistic than some of the ones you find in other books. Lee, the main character, is realistic enough so you develop empathy and root for him. Put it this way, it's good enough for me to buy the remaining books, pun intended."
"This book exploded from the gate and never let up.  It's thinking a persons action novel. He effortlessly intertwined technology and the possible effects on the humanity in a very plausible way. He's on my list of favorite authors."
"I liked the main character development and the man vs himself aspect. However, the knowledge of weapons was a little sketchy and gas goes bad after a year or so unless you use a stabilizer.  Also the characters had a tendency to start shooting when they should have been quiet, such as when they first went  to rescue the lieutenant. The jumping back and forth in time was well done. It is a good zombie story and I'll definitely be reading the second book"
"This was a very disturbing book. I know BATF guys that were involved in the Waco debacle. They are decent guys. However, I do understand the main character wanting his pound of flesh. While freedom is free keeping it isn't. The main character and his pain, could be any gun owner in America, but he has the ability to extract a price for something that should rarely, if ever happen in a ""free"" country. On a side note, the spelling needs to be fixed but the spelling Nazis made some spelling errors when they criticized TJ. CMU (Cracked Me Up).  It saddens me deeply to know this is no longer fringe thinking in our country."
"I absolutely love this set. The fabric is very comfortable. The shipping was fast, I received this product just two days after I ordered it, and I am truly satisfied with the quality."
"i wasn't quite sure on how to use them, never used those before, but the teeth them selves were sucky, but i created a better solution with the putty stuff, i constructed fangs from that! it worked perfectly! if i had more of the bonding stuff to make my teeth that would be even better!"
"The watch looks great, feels great, great price, awesome watch box! Only downside was that the color of the dial to change the date and time is faded. Instead of red its pink. Other than that, awesome."
"Awesome came with three protectors just be careful with the plastic applicator I scratched mine right awayWas very pleased otherwise"
"if you havent seen it, buy it. brat pitt, morgan freeman and kevin spacey like youve never seen him before, ive wanted this movie for a while and showed it to my wife for the first time. blew her mind. I chose the bluray because it was actually cheaper than the dvdso if your a ps3 owner i would suggest the same. shipping was quick and it was in perfect condition, brand new and unopened."
"Awesome game for its time. The game play may not be the best, The graphics are horrible by todays standards but its very fun and the reminiscent value is priceless"
"this flashlight mount definitely is not bad for the price. its nice and universal so i can use it with all kinds and sizes of flashlight. decent for a man on a budget."
"xmas present for the wife. bought her two cds and although they were new and inexpensive, the case of one was pretty beat up when i received it. she likes it, i prefer she plays it when im not around lol"
"i bought this specifically for the sling but the free bandolier will be very handy at the range. good quality and fit."
"wold recomend it it damege the corners of ipod and messes with screen cover if have one on so im verry disapointed"
"I felt like I was with Booker T Washington throughout the entire book.  What a GIANT of a man much respect."
"I got this book 4 my 18 children (gotta keep the jean pool clean!) and their listening and being obidient and wont queston anything i say! There all just soaking up the Light of the Lord! how can i tell; you ask! Just yestarday billie sue asked where did stars come from and before i coudl give em a good canin' bobby sue popped up and told em! He don told him rite their, the anser! He said ""thaht's where God puts the homos to get em out a america!"
"I am satisfied so far, works in my calculator, is easy to install, I'll keep this site handy, if I need the product again."
"Great product, very happy with it. Only thing that sucked was the crappy minimal instructions that came with it. Awesome for not adding fingerprints and oils to your screen, huge improvement over the actual screen in this respect. Can tell it is on, but only because you know you applied it, it is seamless, and a wonderful product. Would recommend and will buy again for future smart phones.READ THIS IF YOU ARE INSTALLING IT:1. You get in fact, two screen protectors, one is a backup.HOW TO INSTALL:1. Find a clean work environment, clean the your phone, remove dust, etc.2. Take the screen protector out of it's carrier bag, and place it where you want it to go onto the phone (goes on one way with how it is cut out). It is indicated which side faces up.3. Take the piece of tape in your kit and tape it to the screen protector and to the side and back of your phone.4. The screen protector can now open up like a book. Open it up, and peel off the reverse of the screen protector exposing the sticky part. If any dust has gotten onto your screen, remove it. Place the screen protector back by closing the 'book like' flap closed.5. Remove the final protective cover with the last tab that sticks out, the tape that was attached to your phone will also come off. If you want to, maybe remove some bubbles now with the squeegee.6. Remove final bubbles, and make sure everything is pressed down firmly. You are done.NOTES: The 'dust removal tape' is sticky as all hell... I did not use it because it adhered way way way too strongly. I don't advise using it, maybe get some scotch tape if you really want."
"It piqued my interest from the start and held it to the end.  Great character development.  I wil read more from this author."
"J'aime la qualit&amp;eacute; de ce produit ainsi que sa beaut&amp;eacute; des couleurs.Avec un cot raisonnable,a vaut la peine de cele procurer"
"It was Nylon, first of all, not fiberglass as advertised.  Secondly, I was using this to mend scratches to my titanium watch and when i used it, not only did it not fix the existing scratches, it just scratched the watch more.  It was not at all what I wanted and I should have looked at the other reviews before buying this..I needed one and it was cheap so I got it without really doing any background research....lesson learned.  Don't buy this."
"Makes you wonder!!"
"I like it very much but it drives me crazy.  I don't understand all the nuances and therefore have won only a few games."
"I bought mine for work, but such an excellent belt I even find myself wearing it for casual day's. Definitely worth it. Carhartt is #1"
"It Did the job. No problems. Just had to clean the fan out then every thing worked out just fine."
"Detailed and approached from a different position. It highlighted details of other players of the time not often detailed in other histories of Elizabeth I."
"Goood"
"Good"
"I haven't given this yet, it's a Christmas present, but I'm sure they will really like it, and watch it often."
"Gave this as an early Christmas gift and they absolutely loved it...I'm sure they'll watch it often...the first one was great too!"
"I gave this to my son as an early Christmas present, and he watched it, and really enjoyed doing it."
"This cook book is incredible, so many great ideas.  Kris Carr is an incredible inspiration, I highly recommend it, as well as Crazy Sexy Diet....enjoy"
"A good read. Alt of characters kept the plot interesting and so south Florida. Amazingly enough there is truth behind these types of folly. Being a true Floridian, I can say this. I would have liked more closure to the end, that's the negative. The pluses are is a light read, great Serge energy, and great facts. It's always a treat to read Dorsey with his use of real Florida landmarks.. thank you for that."
"I loved the simplicity and the ease.  This book is more a book of poems...thoughts than it is a lesson in Buddhism.  It is some thing you can refer to daily.  I Very well done. I will keep this book  forever."
"Great book easy to read and full of inspirational advice.Read it. It's quick to read and well help you achieve awesome!"
"I have to agree with the top reviewer. So far,it's nit working on my kindle. I did some research and it should work.  Or at least that's what I read. So this could get a much higher rating one the glitch is fixed."
"This was a very good basic book. Some stuff is intuitive, some new. I really enjoyed the companion planting guide."
"Good instruction. Covers material type and briefly covers construction making the process feel do-able. Also goes over planting. I wish we has pictures."
"A simple book with tasty recipes. I'm not sure about it lasting 7 days because I've not tried it but I plan on it soon. What a great idea very simple. Although a mason jar is all that is suggested I still being a bowl to dump the contents. For the size I make the jar get cumbersome eat out of. Great salad recipes. Thanks."
"I don't like the fact you need to use your own real money in this. it pisses me off. over all I think that its fun and my little sister likes it."
"this game is the funest game in the universe you will get addicted to it after a minute and when you play different levels it will get fun and fun!"
"this game is a rip off of temple run and is very defeating and stupid . idk how people like this its just so immature and degrating"
"Kept my interest throughout.  Cute love story, which I'm a sucker for....  Waiting now til November for the follow-up novella. :)"
"I would recommend this book to anyone obsessed with serial killers. I didn't like that some questions didn't have enough information."
"Can't believe someone went through all this and came to be the person she is today. Excellent book couldn't put it down"
"I ordered these to go with the rest of the bedding ensemble and this was a pleasing alternate to other curtains."
"I love having a wallet for a phone case. If I want to just run a quick errand it's all I need."
"Enjoy playing this game with friends and family. The bonus in playing this game is I can even play against the cpu."
"This is one of my favorite shows and when I found it on Amazon prime I was so excited. I am very happy with my purchase."
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND ONE OF THE MOST ADDICTIVE GAME OUT THERE! IT HAS A BUNCH OF MINI GAMES AND YOU HAVE THREE LIVES. IT SOUNDS BORING BUT ITS SOOOOOO MUCH FUN!"
"Really pretty, fits great."
"Love It's a 10! Won't do my hair unless I have it! Delivery took a awhile! Overall a happy girl!"
"This game is awesome. I love these types of games where you search for something and have to achieve quests to level"
"I appreciate that this author gets right to the point without all of the fluff.  I learned some things I did not know.  I have made changes with my snacks and doing the exercise everyday at work, in the car, everywhere!  Thank you so much for this ebook!"
"This drive was a replacement in a RAID array and that is why I chose this particular model.  It was an exact replacement for the one that failed after 4 years of hard use.  Hopefully this one will last as long or longer."
"The case is a little big for just the tablet.  it is designed to hold the tablet and the keyboard.  It still works very well as the tablet only moves a little inside the case.  The pocket for the stylus is a great addition because the surface has no way of storing it otherwise.  Overall good product."
"This was great only one problem there need to be MORE episodes how does it end also fb and foursquare code would play nicely is you were to attempt to merge them...unless they are using the sql logs but they would have to know the right data addresses"
"These lights did the job but were not &amp;#34;Neon&amp;#34; as described. I bought them for an outdoor 80's party and they looked more Christmasy than anything. Not very bright but again, did the job. Not the usual size as &amp;#34;rope lights&amp;#34; a little thinner. I did like how they connect so theres no break in lighting but I did have to call the company to figure out how to connect them because there are instructions for everything else about the lights EXCEPT how to connect them."
"I love this shower curtain! It completes my bathroom makeover so well and if it wasnt for Amazon having it, I wouldnt have found such a nice scenery type shower curtain ever!"
"I like the blue lights. Mainly why I bought these but ended up returning them because they crackled and skipped intermittently. Cant have that! I needed speakers for a party and these didn't fit the bill, but for anyone just wanting more sound from their computer, these would be fine."
"Both of my kids birthdays are in Feb so I ordered this when I ordered my first daughters gifts for the beginning of the month. Her birthday went by and then my second daughters came. I wrapped this, she opened it, Dad was in charge of getting it out of the pkg and working and he couldnt get it to work. Nothing. So I tried to return or replace it and I cant because the window has gone by......thats nice. Now my daughter has a birthday gift that doesnt work. Im dissapointed because most everything I get from Amazon is right on. Hopefully no one else gets a bum microphone like we did."
"My husband works on a boat and he needed a good case that would protect his phone from moisture and bait juice...ewe I know! Anyway, This case is so nice. It has the rubber part that goes completely around the phone then the plastic part that kind of seals the rubber and keeps it in place. So between the screen protector and the rubber/plastic case, no water......or bait juice is getting into that phone! Worth the $$."
"I got this crate for my puppy. I love the fact that once we get up in the morning I can let it down slide it under the bed and start my day with no problems. This is the perfect size for him and he loves it as well. I highly recommend this product"
"This book was so great. I actually got into it after falling in live with the movie journey to the center of the earth. Very interesting. A must read"
"Bought this for my husbands tablet case. He says it works fine. Perfect for his tablet. It arrived fast and the service was excellent. Great job"
"I was looking for an otterbox case at local stores and they were expensive. Look on amazon and got this one for more than half of the price. It arrived very quickly and I love it. It wasn't the exact color that I wanted but it is still a great case. Very durable and reliable cause I'm know for dropping my phone a lot.  Great customer service and shipping time"
"I really love this. I noticed an improvement in my dog a week later after using it. I highly recommend this"
"The keyboard carrying case came in handy for my husband who does a lot of traveling. I got it for him for Christmas along with a tablet and he loves them both. Great product and service"
"This product came after the estimated delivery date. The charger takes hours on end to charge my tablet. I mean I feel like I wasted money on this cause I had to turn around and purchase a new charger. Me personally would not be customer again"
"Stunning part works fine. Sadly the flashlight is off and on working at the momentBut still. It works great for defense and it came in good time and packaged well"
"What can I say about it... it&amp;#699;s a basic belt.  It fits, it works, and I like it. Nothing fancy, just a belt to hold up my fatigues or tactical pants.... and I can hang my sidearm holster, and a couple of mags on it as well.  I wanted something low profile, because if I wear a battle belt over it, I didn&amp;#699;t want a big buckle on my pants as well as a cobra buckle on the battle belt.  This is great for what it is.  I gave it 4 stars only because I don&amp;#699;t actually LOVE IT... but I like it alot and it serves its intended purpose well. Buy it."
"I was hoping the front sight wouldn&amp;#699;t extend over the cut out on the top of my Glock 34...and it doesn&amp;#699;t!  It fits just fine.  Tritium glows at dusk, and really glows in darkness!  I left it in the box it shipped in, and then pulled it out in pitch darkness...and it was glowing just fine.  For the price...I&amp;#699;ll put these on my Glock 17 as well!"
"It wasn&amp;#699;t as bright as I had hoped.  I thought I could use this to light up my scrim...but it&amp;#699;s WAY too small.  So I&amp;#699;m using it to send a wash down onto my DJ rig, as it changes color.  Good enough for that use.  I&amp;#699;ll use some slim-pars for the scrims."
"I would recommend getting this as soon as possible if you bought the EZ Starter airbrush kit.  The reason is that the cap assembly (the little thingy on the top of the cap that plugs into the airbrush &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34;) that comes with the kit will eventually break. Again, if you look at the picture above, it&amp;#699;s that little tube thing thats attached to the bottle cap.  The one that comes with the EZ kit is made of plastic.  I used my sprayer about 3 times, and on the last time I used it, I was plugging the bottle into the gun, and the little tip broke off!Anyway...long story short:  This one is made of metal, and so is the cap itself. I forsee it lasting much longer than the one that came with the gun, so I bought two of them.  I gave it 5 stars because it&amp;#699;s a simple product that exceeds what I originally had."
"I wasn&amp;#699;t sure if this light was going to be bright enough...but it&amp;#699;s PLENTY bright!  I use this LED bar on the top of my light bar tripod...and I hang a vertigo and Revo Rave under it... and it&amp;#699;s perfect.  I&amp;#699;ll probably end up buying a 2nd Mega Pixel LED bar, and use two of them linked master/slave and run those on my truss. This ONE bar will light up a medium sized room all by itself."
"When I was deciding to buy this I really couldn&amp;#699;t tell from the pic what it looked like...because HELLO??!!!  The pic is showing the INSIDE (belt loop side) of the pouch!!!  Why they did that I have no idea!!  BUT... once I got it...it was EXACTLY what I wanted.  It&amp;#699;s a dual mag plastic pouch, and it holds my mags (Glock 17) in place very well. It has a nice fit where the mags slide in firmly. I loaded 2 full double stack mags and turned it upside down and shook it...and yes, after a couple of shakes the mags did fall out...however, how many of you are planning to do a handstand and jiggle your magazines out??! It works folks.  And the price is decent and it&amp;#699;s fairly &amp;#34;low profile&amp;#34;  and isn&amp;#699;t a big bulky holder.  I believe the screw that you see between the two magazines is a tension screw and will put more tension on the mags.  I haven&amp;#699;t tried it yet, but I don&amp;#699;t see the need at the moment.  I&amp;#699;m happy with how it holds my magazines.OH...AND you can set both magazines facing the same direction for easy/quick reloads.  I know there is another mag pouch out there where you can only put them in facing the opposite direction.  I don&amp;#699;t like that.  I&amp;#699;d rather them be set up so I can pull and load in one quick motion...without having to worry about turning one.For the price I paid, and what I got...it&amp;#699;s 5 *&amp;#699;s for me!"
"Right off the bat...This one gets 5 FIVE STARS.  I'd give it 10 of 10 if I could.Ok now on on to my review of this knife:While this is the first ""name brand"" folding knife I've ever bought, I've carried an EDC folding blade on me for years. I own a Cold Steel SRK fixed blade, and I love that knife. It's my hunting/camping/survival knife. And I own a Schrade SCHF10, which I also love.  But when it comes to folders...I've always bought the no-name, use it/break it, or lose it, then throw it away knives.  Usually whatever looks good at my local hardware store, or gun shop.  With that being said, I currently own maybe 8-10 different no-name folders (all under $20 bucks) that I have rotated in and out of my EDC gear and I have maybe 2 that I like, and that actually work in my system. The one I've been carrying the most over the last 2 years has been a Tac-Force Karambit style blade ($15 bucks).  I've dropped that thing in the mud, used it in a river, dropped it from a ladder about 20' off the ground, abused it in the rain, and it's been good, but it's seen it's better days, and it's not much in terms of a slicer.So in my search for a replacement, I started to think about getting something with a little better quality. If I add up all those $10-15-18-20 dollar knives...I could have 3 or 4 really GOOD blades! I probably won't buy a Benchmark or any other knife over a hundred bucks...I just don't have the need or budget for one like that.  BUT... this Spyderco fit my budget (UNDER $50 bucks), useage, and my EDC needs perfectly so I bought it...  And I'm glad I did! On this purchase, I researched all kinds of knives and steel types before making my choice.  And for the money...the Spyderco Tenacious is hard to beat.  Yes, there are tons of good quality knives at this same price range, but then I believe it just comes down to personal preference. I narrowed my search down to Spyderco and the SOG Flash 2 (they're both about the same price), but chose the Tenacious because I've always been drawn to that cool blade shape with the hole in it!  (I WILL buy that SOG soon!)I live in Hawaii so we are exposed to salt air and water on a regular basis.  I don't plan on diving with my knife, but I needed a blade with steel and internals that was going to have some corrosion resistance. I wanted something I could use as a back up on a hunt, camping, or to cut boxes at work.  I also needed this to be a regular EDC blade, and I wanted to stay away from the tactical look, and get more of a gentleman's carry that's still agressive enough looking.  What I wanted was something high speed, lightweight, strong, durable, and of course...some good looks never hurt nobody! I found it in the Spyderco Tenacious!-The G10 scales are grippy enough..but not overly so.  Just right, in my opinion.-I like the blade.  It is a little thin towards the tip, but it's nothing I'll worry about. I personally prefer the plain edge vs. the combo edge.  I also prefer the FFG (full flat grind) blade.  It's just my own preference. I think the 8Cr13MoV steel is a high enough quality...again, at least for my personal requirements.-NO blade play when the knife is open.  None at ALL. Up/down, side to side...nothing.  I've seen reviews of people saying there was some in their knives, but none in mine. When closed, the blade sits dead centered. I've also seen reviews with people saying their blades were off-centered, mine was not one of those.-Ergo: Feels good in my hand. Nice jimping at the top.  Nice big hole to slide my thumb in to open.  Opens quickly enough.  Not as fast as my Tac Force assisted opening Karambit, or my buddy's SOG Aegis 2 assisted opener...but good nonetheless, with a solid ""Thwackk"" upon lock-up.  I LIKE that!-Clip is a bit tight, but not a deal breaker.  I like that I can change it to a tip up carry as opposed to tip down, as it comes from the factory.-The liner lock looks very strong.  Nice tight lock up when deployed.  I like that not only can I open the blade with one hand, but I can also press the liner lock, and close the blade with one hand as well.-The BEST thing I like about this knife is the Foilage Green handles!  I wish the blade was black with the green handles...but again, not a deal breaker at all. The green is sweet! Pic's online don't do it any justice.  It's not a bright green at all. But not a dark OD Green either.  As I said, I wanted something that wasn't SO TACTICAL. My Streamlight ProTAC flashlight is black tactical, same as my Tac Force karambit, AND my SOG multi-tool!  I just wanted to tone down the Tactical Operator look of my EDC.  The foilage green makes this knife less imposing, in my opinion.-And finally...it was super sharp right out of the box! I ran it on a ceramic sharpener when I got it just to take off some of the burrs...but VERY sharp.Overall I love this knife!  So much so, that I'm already looking at the Spyderco Manix 2.  THAT knife is on the higher end of my budget, I'm trying to stay under the $50 mark for my EDC blades, but I might make the exception for the Manix 2 (AFTER I buy the SOG Flash 2!!) Here's something I don't get: I've seen tons of reviews here (just click on all the 1 or 2 star reviews) that talk about how bad this knife is or how it pales in comparison to other brands, or even other Spyderco knives.  Here's my thing: Hell, if you were expecting to get the same quality as an Endura or Paramilitary...why didn't you just buy THAT??!  This is a $36 dollar BUDGET Spyderco.  Review it for what it is.  A blade made in China, that is in their budget line of knives. And to that end...it's a GREAT blade for the price. But back to my Spyderco Tenacious in foilage green.  Great price, great knife!Buy it, Use it, LOVE it. You won't be disappointed.  *And if you ARE...go buy a Benchmark and be happy!"
"I just picked up TWO of the 7-1/2 inch scissors.  One for my First Aid kit at home, and one for my personal IFAK kit that goes in my truck, hunting, shooting, camping, etc. My first impression was: Wow...this is BIG.  It's a pretty big size shears.  After reading other reviews, it looks like the smaller set might be a little too small for big hands.  I may order a small set for my personal kit, because this one doesn't quite fit inside. I have to strap it to the outside of my kit.  Overall...I like them. I haven't used them enough yet to LOVE them...but I'm sure if I ever have to use them in an emergency...they'll be awesome."
"If any of you watch YouTube...look up Nutnfancy's review of this light. He says it all...Originally, I was looking at either the Preon-1 or 2, or the Pro Stylus, and ended up seeing this one on the page for the Stylus here on Amazon... so I clicked on it and opened it up.  And I am glad I did!  I was looking for an EDC flashlight that was light enough to carry in my pocket every day, but wasn't going to break the bank in terms of cost, and this fits that role perfectly.  I didn't want to spend more than $30 on this light because I already have an Olight M20 Warrior, and an Olight T25 which I LOVE both...but even the T25 is a little too big for EDC (at least for me).  The Preon 1 is a twist top (to turn on/off) and I wanted a tailcap pushbutton, and that's why the Pro Stylus was my original choice. (I STILL may buy the Preon-1, because for only $32 bucks that thing looks like a powerhouse of a mini flashlight!) However, I ended up going with this one instead of the Pro Stylus due to the higher lumens and it has a high/low/strobe function, which the Pro Stylus does not.  And in comparison to the Preon-1, this was a little bigger, and I didn't want to lose the small Preon.And wow...this thing is awesome for such a little pkg.Pro's (for me):Good amount of light: 80 lumens on high, 10 on low.Lightweight.  I barely notice it's there.O-rings for water resistance. (I think it says it's waterproof down to 3-5 meters or something like that, but I don't intend on diving with it, so that's fine.)Good quality build.Good price: $29 bucks on Amazon, but I've seen it for less elsewhere.I like that it uses AAA batteries, which are readily available anywhere. (There is a AA version of this light as well, if you want a little bigger version!)Con's:I wish the clip was a little higher, so it rides deeper in my pocket.  So I don't lose it.The tailcap button is hard to press.  But I'm finding I might like that so it doesn't accidently get turned on in my pocket or bag.I wish it came in other colors: metallic orange, blue, green, etc.  Then it's easer to find in a dark bag at night.I wish the high/low beams were right next to each other, instead of it being: Hight (single click), Strobe (double click), and Low (triple click).  Put the low before strobe!  I'm sure there is some reason for that.  But it's not a deal breaker by any means.It fits in my pocket right next to my Spydeco Tenacious just fine.  It's about the size of a fat sharpie pen and I barely notice it's there.  In fact since I started carrying it, I have to reach down once in a while to feel if it's still there!So here's what I did at home when I first got it.  I pulled out my large Maglite, my Olight T25, and a no name Asian brand LED light I bought here on Amazon for 4 bucks (I didn't bother bringing out the M20 because that thing is a beast. I turned all the lights out in my living room and tested them by shining them on the ceiling one at a time.  The Maglite and T25 have fairly new batteries, and the little LED has never been used.  So the T25 was brightest, the no-name LED was dead last...and this little Streamlight beat that huge Maglite! In terms of brightness, wide beam...it killed my big maglite! I took my new ProTAC outside and shined it out to where my dogs are (about 20m) and it lit up the whole area.  I don't think it throws 80m as advertised...but it sure does put out a lot of light.If you're looking for a good quality, high lumen EDC light that won't break the bank...this IS IT. Buy it. Carry it.  Love it.  You'll be glad you did.UPDATE:Last night after a gig (I moonlight as a musician) I was walking out along the back of the hotel I was at, back to the parking lot and remembered I had my ProTAC in my pocket, so I pulled it out to test it. It was really dark, almost pitch black, and I must say, this light really lit up the entire area.  So I'll take back what I said above...this light lit up a couple trash cans and boxes that were out at least 60m from where I was!  I shined it down this really long maintenance pathway, and it lit the whole area.  I am impressed more than I was before. If you're looking at the Pro Stylus, take a look at this light as well.  It's a little bigger diameter-wise...but well worth it in my opinion. 10 out of 5 stars!"
"For what it is...it&amp;#699;s 5 stars. Yes, it could be better by being linkable to other LED Pulse&amp;#699;s, and I&amp;#699;m sure there are 3 or 4 other ways it could be better...but then the price would go up and it would be a different animal. So, for what it IS...I LOVE it.With that being said, I bought the light because it was fairly inexpensive, and I wanted to see how it performed, and I&amp;#699;m happy to say: it exceeded my expectations.  The LED&amp;#699;s are much brighter than I expected, and this little (it&amp;#699;s actually not THAT little) unit threw nice LED patterns across the hall, no problem. It covered a really large area.  The strobe function is just ok, nothing to write home about, but it&amp;#699;s another effect built-in, and I like that feature alot.  I really wish it was linkable, but like I said above...it would be a different animal.  I think I might buy another unit, and set them up on the bottom of a T-bar, with my mega pixel LED across the top.  Perfect for a small to medium size venue.My gigs aren&amp;#699;t huge where I need scanners or moving heads, but the Reflex Pulse gives the look and feel of a scanner.  If you&amp;#699;re looking for an affordable alternative to a scanner effect, this is a good buy.  Also, I&amp;#699;ve been reading online that Am.DJ is coming out with a linkable/DMX version...but some of those posts were from 2 years ago.  Either way, I&amp;#699;m not sure they&amp;#699;d make it under $150 bucks.If you have questions on it, post them.  I&amp;#699;ll respond as best as I can."
"There are a ton of reviews out there on this particular knife.  It caught my eye on knifecenter.com so I decided to take a closer look and looked at reviews here on Amazon as well as YouTube.  There are some really good reviews on YouTube. Overall I like this knife.  I bought it to give away as a gift, but I may end up buying another one to keep.I bought the straight blade, not serrated, which is what I prefer. I think the blade steel is decent quality.  It&amp;#699;s the same steel as my Spyderco Tenacious, strong enough, and able to sharpen up fairly easily.  I like the handle grip, it&amp;#699;s very good and feels comfortable in hand. No blade play up, down, or side to side when it&amp;#699;s deployed.  I like the secondary lock on the top of the frame.  That&amp;#699;s a nice added safety feature.  I&amp;#699;m not too keen on the pocket clip.  That looks a little...low-tech if I can say that.  I wish it was a little more agressive looking and not so FAT.  And then the knife overall is a little wide.Other than that I have no real complaints.  These are my first impressions right out of the box...and I haven&amp;#699;t actually put it to use, BUT...I can tell this knife will take a beating. The good news: It&amp;#699;s not a hundred dollar knife that I&amp;#699;ll be afraid to put to hard use.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&amp;#699;s a little wider than expected, and that silly looking pocket clip."
"OK so there are a lot of people who rag on Condor as ""airsoft ONLY"" equipment. I completely disagree. Yes, it&amp;#699;s fine for airsoft.  But unless I was going to be deployed...this gear is good enough to do run and gun, or even in a WROL situation it would work fine.  It IS made in China, and yes, sometimes you&amp;#699;re going to run into quality check issues, but for the most part, this rig works great.  And for the price...it earns 5 stars because it&amp;#699;s worth it and then some.  And I know there are a lot of snobs who poke their noses up in the air in regards to Condor, but I have a number of pouches and other gear from them, and I personally think they&amp;#699;re built strong.Now on to the review:I run this chest rig with a Condor rip away EMT bag on my left, and a Condor sidekick pouch on my right, both pouches on either side of the sewn in magazine pouch. I run 4 pistol mags with my flashlight and multitool positioned in the 2 middle pistol mag pouches.  While I can carry 6 AR mags in it, I usually carry 3. With all this gear on, it&amp;#699;s still comfortable enough for all-day use (PLEASE...this is BATTLE GEAR. IT&amp;#699;S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FLEECE LINED, PARIS HILTON KINDA STUFF!!!) just be sure to set it up right. I&amp;#699;m a big guy wearing a 2x shirt, and this fits me fine.  It would probably fit someone who wears a 3x or maybe even 4x.  (and if you&amp;#699;re a 4x kinda guy...hit the stationary bike once in a while! Trust me, you&amp;#699;ll thank me later.) The molle on this rig fits all of my gear fine, no problems there.  The stitching is heavy duty. Maybe not mil-spec, but heavy duty nonetheless. One thing I like about this rig is that I can put my Condor compact assult pack on my back, and I&amp;#699;m good to go.  *YES...I have a LOT of Condor gear in this loadout but I also have Maxpedition as well as Camelbak equipment on other rigs.So, if you&amp;#699;re being deployed...go with the best you can buy.  If you&amp;#699;re just planning for the zombie apocalypse or run-n-gun training or competition, this will work fine, and you&amp;#699;ll be happy you saved the money.One more thing on Condor:From what I&amp;#699;ve seen and read, their quality has gone up tremendously in the last couple of years.  They&amp;#699;re really making an honest effort to win our business with quality equipment that&amp;#699;s made overseas.  And on top of that, they&amp;#699;ve also started manufacturing some products here in the U.S."
"This is exactly what I wanted for my Mosin.  It&amp;#699;s the kit, and only thing missing is the little oil container. But no big deal... I run my boresnake thru it instead.  But I got it for the spacer tool for the bolt assembly.  Works good."
"I bought this knife based on reviews I found on different forums and YouTube. Just google or search YouTube, you&amp;#699;ll find a TON of information and reviews on this knife.  One of the best reviews is by Nutnfancy on YouTube.  Here&amp;#699;s my thoughts:BLADE:AUS8 steel.  It&amp;#699;s decent steel... Sharpens up easily, and keeps an edge.  It was extremely sharp out of the box, and I personally prefer FFG blades, so that was another plus for me.  Nice jimping on the top of the blade that helps with grip when cutting.  The thumb studs are solid.  When closed, the blade on my knife sits exactly centered.  NO blade-play whatsoever.  Up, down, left, right...it&amp;#699;s solid.  The satin finish is nice.  I like how the RAT logo contrasts on the blade.  Very cool.  (I&amp;#699;ve seen reviews on the black finish, and people are saying that it comes off way too easily, and really is there just for looks.  So I&amp;#699;ve decided to stay away from it.) The blade has a nice belly, and is shaped for a lot of different utility tasks.  The blade shape and FFG is one of the main reasons I looked at this knife in the first place.  Well, that and the price.HANDLES:Another reviewer said these were G10.  I don&amp;#699;t think so, and I don&amp;#699;t remember what I read in the blade review forums...but I think it&amp;#699;s Zytel or something.  But it feels like G10.  The finish is really nice on the handles.  The finger choil up front is deep, and it fits my finger in nicely.  It gives good solid control in hand.  It&amp;#699;s not as grippy as my Spyderco Tenacious, but it&amp;#699;s in that same style: sort of a smoothed out grip.  I&amp;#699;m not sure how it will hold up covered in blood (I hunt wild boar) or even just water...that remains to be seen, but I don&amp;#699;t think it will be a problem. (I&amp;#699;ll update this review if it is) I really like the coyote color.  It complements the satin blade very nice.  IF it were G10 handles, the knife would be even MORE AWESOME.  But then again...the price on this knife would probably jump as well.BUILD:Well made. Torx screws hold it all together and the pillar/liner construction looks strong.  I don&amp;#699;t mind that this knife is made overseas.  It&amp;#699;s well done. (Good quality control in manufacturing) I know others have said this, and I agree...if Ontario would have skeletonized the steel liners, that could shave an ounce off the weight.  But the weight (5 oz I believe) is fine to me.  It doesn&amp;#699;t feel that much more heavier than my Spyderco Tenacious in my pocket.CLIP:I like that the clip is 4 way adjustable.  Tip down, Tip up, left, right... you can set it up the way you want.  A definite plus. It&amp;#699;s a long clip too and sits relatively deep in the pocket. The only thing I don&amp;#699;t like is that black paint. I felt that a stainless clip would match the blade better. I&amp;#699;ve seen pics and videos of this exact knife after a year or two of use...and the chipped black finish on the clip looks kinda cool... gives it that &amp;#34;Boba Fet&amp;#34; worn in battle tested look.  So it&amp;#699;s not a deal breaker, and I think over time it&amp;#699;s going to give this knife some personality. If I end up not liking that look...I&amp;#699;ll just take the clip off and buff off the black finish myself.  Easy enough.EDC-ability:It&amp;#699;s a little big for a TRUE EDC knife in my opinion.  But to me, a TRUE EDC blade would be a Kershaw OSO Sweet, or Spyderco Dragonfly, or something similarly sized. (Those are the two I own and carry as EDC, so they&amp;#699;re my only comparisons) BUT, lately I&amp;#699;ve been carrying larger sized blades: Spyderco Tenacious, SOG Flash 2, and now the RAT-1. I don&amp;#699;t feel it&amp;#699;s too big at all. I like that it&amp;#699;s a little bigger, and my EDC blades become medium sized tactical folders. So, YES on the EDC-ability for ME.It was $40 dollars which is a little more than I wanted to pay, (I was hoping for around $30-35) but it&amp;#699;s fine...I figured it was due to the demand for the coyote brown.  For the price...this knife is STILL a very good deal.  Regardless of it being made in Taiwan...it&amp;#699;s well built.  It blows my mind that there are folks comparing this knife to other more expensive blades and complaining about the steel, or not being made in the US, or the lack of G10 scales...??!!  IF this knife were to be made that way...it would be MUCH more than $40 dollars!  So judge it for what it is.  It&amp;#699;s a $40 dollar knife that will take whatever you throw at it.  AND it has a limited lifetime warranty.  Not bad for a budget folding knife made in Taiwan.  (And the plain black handle version can be bought right here on Amazon for $27 bucks!!!)If you&amp;#699;re looking for a HIGH value, MID sized, LOW (to MID) priced, budget (IMO) folder...the Ontario RAT-1 fits that bill. It&amp;#699;s well worth the price. 9 out of 10 for me.  *If the clip was stainless, and the liner skeletonized to drop weight...DEFINITE 10 at $40 bucks for the Coyote handles, and $27 for the black handles!!! Get one...!!!."
"There are SO MANY reviews on these headphones, and you&amp;#699;ll get all kinds of technical reviews.  But here&amp;#699;s my take:These are good.  There are a few people who say they&amp;#699;re better than Beats...I don&amp;#699;t know about that.  My Beats are great and these are close but not quite. IMHO. Keep in mind, these are &amp;#34;Extra Bass&amp;#34; headphones.  So the bass frequencies are going to have a lot more presence due to the fact that these are tuned that way.  So... don&amp;#699;t expect them to have a flat EQ response across the board.  They&amp;#699;re GOOD, and for $39 bucks...that&amp;#699;s GREAT!  So they get 5 stars for that reason.Let me also say this: I&amp;#699;ve got a pretty big dome.  My fitted cap size is 7-3/4.  Yea Yea Yea...I know.  BUT, I wanted a set of headphones that wouldn&amp;#699;t squeeze my head, or a set that I didn&amp;#699;t have to open them to their farthest most position to wear them.  These... 2-3 clicks on each side, and I&amp;#699;m good.  Oh...and that was a nice touch too.  The little &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; so you can be sure they&amp;#699;re even on both sides.IF you&amp;#699;re someone that doesn&amp;#699;t like bass... then don&amp;#699;t get these.  You&amp;#699;ll be tweaking your EQ all day, every day.  I personally like the deeper freq response.  And what I did was set my EQ flat from the lowest freq&amp;#699;s, and then a little higher on the high freq&amp;#699;s.I would recommend this buy to anyone with a big size noggin&amp;#699; looking for headphones that don&amp;#699;t squeeze or pinch your head."
"Ok so when I saw this I was really skeptical, even with all of the good reviews. I wasn't sure that this little angled speaker could put out decent sound...BUT IT DOES! it doesn't sound tinny or weak....and holds up to louder volumes and doesn't distort when you think it will.The first day I got it, i was supposed to do a workout class in a room with a 70"" TV. Unfortunately someone else booked the same room and had 25 people in there for a workshop....so i moved my little workout group of 8 to another room without a TV. I hooked this up to my computer and played the workout DVD (Insanity!) where the instructor is giving directions AND there's music playing...and we had NO PROBLEM hearing all of it.  The room was FILLED with sound! It was the tiny 15"" screen that was difficult!Sure it's not a Bose speaker, or Beats pill, or the new Sol Republic deck.... But for only $39 bucks....I can buy FIVE of these little babies for the price of ONE of those. It just so happens that I saw the commercial for the Sol Deck on the same day I ordered this...and I said to myself: if this doesn't perform, I'll return it. So  I kept the packing material just in case. But after that first emergency use.... I'm sold. I threw all the packing stuff away and I'm keeping it! I can already forsee using it on the beach, poolside, with my laptop when watching a movie, etc.Look... It's bluetooth, battery operated, compact, and inexpensive. It'll even function as a handsfree speaker for your phone! And did I say it was only $39 bucks??!!  BUY WITH CONFIDENCE.  And if you&amp;#699;d rather spend $200-300 bucks on a Bose, Beats, or Sol, go ahead and do it if that&amp;#699;s your budget or preference.  For me... $39 bucks is GREAT, and I won&amp;#699;t worry if it gets wet or banged around in my computer bag."

"I bought this striping tape thinking I could use it for making designs and creating perfect stripes. When I got it I was so excited. It was easy to place down on my nail. However, when I put the top coat on, some of the color from the tape was gone. Then the tape began lifting and peeling off. I ended up just painting over the tape and peeling it off to create lines. By itself, the tape is not a good nail art tool. When used to make other designs on your nail and then just peel off the tape, though, it works better."
"I saw these and decided to try them out. I love them! These wheels make it so much easier to practice a design that I want to try. I can test colors together and practice techniques so when I do my manicure, it turns out perfect! True, it's difficult to water marble these one at a time, or to use a sponge to add a gradient to one, but overall I love these practice wheels."

"Nassim Taleb writes in a very authoritarian voice.  His tone is frequently at once both pompous and arrogant.  The man is brilliant and he knows it.  He is not shy about letting his reader know it either.  Taleb is brutally contemptuous of those he violently disagrees with being mostly what he terms charlatan and/or fragalista, highly-educated, academic economic pundits that prostitute themselves to business and/or government to perpetuate stupid, destructive ideas and outright fraud either knowingly or unknowingly.  The actual premise of ""Antifragile"" is quite simple in many ways and could essentially be explained in a couple of pages quite thoroughly.  Taleb takes over 500 pages to discuss the concept going all the way through the Index.  The man is multi-lingual and extremely well read, particularly in the classics.  There are hundreds of references throughout the text to works of literature from different centuries, cultures and languages.  Frequently, the connection to the main theme of the book seems a bit stretched but the vignettes are almost always quite interesting and thought provoking.  Taleb has strong opinions on a wide variety of topics and presents them as facts in a harsh, clipped fashion.  Much of what Taleb proclaims is quite outside the norm and at odds with conventional wisdom.  As soon as I started reading ""Antifragile"" I could not stop and read the entire book in one long sleep-deprived session with minimal breaks to walk my dogs.  I savored many passages with feelings similar to scraping the fatty delicious meat off the bone of a perfectly charcoal-grilled T-bone steak with my teeth.  I wanted to reread the book immediately but will force myself to wait a minimum of one year before doing so that I can think about the concept of antifragility using my own references and experience without the bombastic voice of Taleb pounding inside my head.  ""Antifragile"" is probably the best book I have ever read.  It is certainly the most important.  I won't attempt to summarize the main theme of ""Antifragile"".  I would prefer that people read the book for themselves.  I believe every rationale person on the planet should read this book.  If people applied the concept of antifragility as defined in great detail by Taleb their lives would become happier and more successful.  If the world were ruled by numerous city-states governed by the concept of antifragility our planet would become a safer more productive place.  Poverty and hunger would be largely eradicated.  The global economy would be much healthier and there would be little war.  The threat of nuclear holocaust would diminish exponentially.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb has written a book that could significantly change the world for the better.  There is no greater achievement available to an author."
"I bought this product after reading an article about it but was very disappointed. It did nothing at all for me. No weight loss, no curbing of appetite, nothing. What a waste of time."
"This product is awesome. I did not expect it to work this well. I use it every chance I get."
"Great - puts my bostich to shame. Best $7 dollars you will spend in your office!! Will staple more sheets than the rest..."

"This amzing toy has taken first priority over any other toys my boys have! it keeps them entertained for hours an end because they can build on their own and use imagiantive skills as they play. they love this toy by far and i would continue investing in the new parts that come out so they could enjoy it forever! thank you for this amazing product!!"
"this bookk is a wonderful idea. i bought it for my 4 year old and sat sown with him to create some of the most creative ideas they have in there. after i showed him how to build those projects he was able to repeat them on his own, and it kept him busy for really long. for example he built a 3 story house then put in animals on 1 floor, people on another and so on. he also built the table and chairs, and brought fake food for the people. in general i feel the book is so worth the small price it costs, it takes the amazing toy to greater options!!"
"i was very disappointed with this item since after i put the ink into my printer it keeps saying low ink"
"Excellent, EXCELLENT knife! Very lightweight with the FRN scales, which is NOT cheap plastic as some have said. The swede grind is perfection, coming sharp as hell right out of the box. I would not hesitate to buy this knife again! Fits in the pocket nicely and can barely tell it's there. Doesn't rip your pants either when you pull it out as some G10 handles have the tendency to do(I still like G10 btw) Another solid product from Spyderco."
"Clarks' generation was one that actually could sing. Put him on any &amp;#34;American Idol&amp;#34; show and I bet he would win. 10 times out of 10. Amazing voice, hauntingly good song. unforgettable listening experience that still stacks up against any soul artist today."
"Very stout litle guy, sharp as heck out of the box! CRKT knows how to make a knife. good buy."
"Bought it for a friend who does Caving professionally and she loves it. Lightweight, feels like a much bigger knife in hand than it is. WILL NOT RUST!!! Great, great buy."
"The screens require a solution to ensure proper adhesion and no air bubbles getting trapped. This solution is not included. If you have such solution already then this is a great product. I however, did not, and had no use for them."
"Bought as a gift for my roommate who sells real estate. Obviously he needs a professional looking planner that also gets the job done and makes his day easier; this one does the job. Great looking, solidly built, and has plenty of space to write and organize his days."
"It was exactly what I saw when I was shopping for it. Occasionally the color can get waited online, and you will see it as a different color than it is. But I was surprised to see that it was the exact color that I had thought it would be, and just what I was looking for. A great fit!"
"The recording quality is mediocre. I found it to be contrived. Also, it doesn't follow the instrumentation for the score.Postive elements are: The demo is useful to get one's bearings &amp; some of the accompaniments are well represented.It wasn't a waste of money, for the price it serves a purpose."

"I love mybat. Its just as good as otterbox, cheaper, and more styles. I will definitely be ordering again. Only thing is, is after a good bit of use, the enamel started chipping. But still most definitely, absolutely worth it."
"it's pretty comfy, though there are some minor glitches in the design. the ridges are slightly skewed (ca. 1.0mm), but it's not a problem. a pity there aren't more of them, the farthest it can go is ca. 40 degrees."
"Pron: I'm so happy i got mine today, but I'm disappointed because it's not working :(Con: I hook up the cable on my phone and I'd notice that there's a gap like .5 centimeter, meaning it doesn't fit all way in, propably thats the problem? Even though, it says on the description of this product it works on s3 and I'm using s3.Is there anyway to refund my money back or change the product?"

"I, too, bought the $49 starter kit from Home Depot.  Brought it home, put the bulbs in, connected the gateway, and downloaded the app.  After an initial hiccup with the app, I got everything fired up and working.  Support easy to set up bulb names, room names and set scenes.  I ordered five flood lights (br30) to add to the house, and they also work great.  I recommend this system."

"I would not believe the other reviewers, these are total junk and had to be returned. The material is paper thin and had torn away from multiple places on both boots, this was new out of the box, not after wearing. There are many good deals on amazon for boots, but this is not one of them. Do yourself a favor and skip these."
"This blade is THICK, i have another mora knife and this blade is about three times thicker, its great. Buy it"
"These are issue, circa 91. You can not beat it for the price, especially thinking about what our careless government spent on these. If you use a built in magazine pull like the ones on Troy battlemags or the slip on variety such as Magpul magazine pulls, the flaps on this will not even come close to snapping. If your using duct tape and 550 cord, maybe, thats a BIG maybe they will snap close. Its a tight fit. If your using plain pmags, troy battlemags, promag, gi steel mags, or colt mags (all 30 rounders) then they should snap for you.Its not a bad idea to buy 2 of these and keep one loaded and another one full of empty mags that you rotate every 6mo, that way if the S ever does HTF then you should have 7 mags ready to go (one in your rifle), standard combat load for US troops is 210 rounds, 7 mags."
"I coupled this with the VTS from fab-defense on my AR and I am buying a new railed handguard for my AK just so i can mount the same setup on my AK. Much more comfortable than a vertical grip."

"I got tired of my mascara running when prepping food for guests.  These definitely do the trick.  If the fumes are really strong they can still burn my nose a bit, but overall these glasses have made chopping onions so much more enjoyable.  I tried all the other tricks...running under cold water, putting onions in the freezer shortly, or in the fridge etc.  None of them kept my eyes from watering except for these glasses!"

"These truffles are so tasty and smooth. When you first put it in your mouth they are a little bit bitter because of the cocoa powder, but as soon as its gone you taste the rich sweetness of the truffles. They came 2 days before the estimated delivery date! I would recomment these to everyone, especially chocolate lovers. They were totaly worth it for 2lbs of truffles!!"
"Can I just say, there's nothing like a hot Brisitsh boy? Oh man, the feels in this book. Such an awesome read :)"
"I was dying to get the Kindle Fire, had it a short while, then it wouldn't charge. Disappointing I know; So I contacted Amazon, and they said they'd replace it.. however I had to wait a month to get my replacement.. That sucked literally... but I was happy that they were replacing it so I eagerly and not so happily waited for it to arrive which was  around the 1st of January. Then it arrived I was yet again paired with my travel companion! Well 4 months later it won't charge... again So I contact Amazon and they say they'll replace it even though my warranty is inches from expiring. Today I get my 3rd kindle and it has hyper pixels of bright white light shining through the images. So I contacted amazon once again and now are sending me a 4th Kindle !! 4 KINDLES IN 1 YEAR. That's just ridiculous! The only thing amazon can say is sorry nothing else; that they will forward my complaints to their specialized customer service and go from there... I think that means we'll just throw it in a folder with everyone else's complaints; because we are still making money here.  Its really disappointing, that I am on number 4. I am sure Amazons' CEO doesn't care, because they still have good sales. So who cares! Shame on Amazon.... All of my friends have kindles, and they all have had to have them replaced at least once, some of them twice, and the feedback forums are full of unsatisfied customers, Amazons not making it as right as they could be."
"I... I just... Okay I can't do this right now... I need a minute okay?30 minutes later...Yeah, 1 minute, 30 minutes... whatever. If you've read this book, you understand. If you haven't, you will when you have. This book is so... my god I still can't find the right words.Another 15 minutes later...Okay I'm ready now. This book was heartbreaking and so beautiful. It's one of the best I've read this year. While I was reading, I was laughing, crying and speechless. It was both sad and uplifting. It's a story about coping with loss, grief, regret, making mistakes and trying to fix them. But it's also a story about friendship, forgiveness and love. Brilliant, just... brilliant.I didn't understand that at first, but I did once I finished the book. I get it know. So does Kacey. Kacey is the main character in this story. Four years ago she was in a terrible accident in which she lost so much. Since then, she has never been the same. But she still has her sister Livie. They move to Miami to escape their aunt and uncle and to start over. That's not easy, of course. They meet their neighbors, Storm and her daughter Mia. Storm helps Kacey get a job as her co-worker. A bartender in a strip-club. And they meet Trent. The hot guy from appartement 1D. But Kacey still has to deal with her past and she doesn't let anybody come to close to her. Somehow Trent finds a way to crawl under her skin, but he too has some skeletons in his closet. I can't talk about that because it's a huge spoiler and you have to read the book and feel everything without knowing what'll happen. So no more about that. The writing was excellent. Absolutely without a doubt. This woman has a lot of talent. Can't wait to start the sequel.I loved Kacey. She was so awesome, seriously. Yeah, she has some major issues to deal with, but that's understandable, isn't it? She went through a lot and honestly, I don't blame her for coping with it the way she did. I wouldn't even have survived it. She really is tough. Oh, I love her sarcasm and the fact that she can kick some ass, literally.I also loved Livie, although we didn't get to know her that well. Still, she's cool for a fifteen-year-old. Oh and Storm. Who would've thought that a blond barbie with huge tits who works in a strip club could be so awesome? But she is, she really is. She's caring and nice and so sweet. She's a great friend and an even greater mom. I really love her.Now we talk about the guy. The hot guy from appartement 1D. He wasn't what I expected. At all. At first, I thought he'd be one of those hot guys that fixes the troubled girl with sex. But he's not that guy. He's a sweet, caring and loving man and a gentleman. I never would've guessed that. But... no I can't talk about that because it's a big fat spoiler, so I'm not going to say anything. But in the end, my opinion about him is still the same.Basically I loved all the characters. Cain, the owner of the club where Storm and Kacey work, is so cool. He's not a stereotype! Hurray! I loved them all and I will remember them for a long time.By writing Ten Tiny Breaths K.A. Tucker crawled under MY skin and didn't let me go. I don't think I'll forget this book anytime soon."
"Wow... This book is heartbreaking, frustrating, dramatic, romantic and more. It was more then I expected, to be honest. Way more. And I loved every part of it.So in this book suicide is an epidemic. And the only 'cure' they could come up with is The Program. (Stupid donkeys... I may have a few ideas that could help you know. For instance... Stop the monkeys that are making those super kill pills or let people mourn when they've lost someone... Don't wipe their memory if they get depressed because it's actually your fault they are because they can't show their emotions the way they should... Okay, I'm stopping now. Moving on.) So you get it. The Program basically erases your memories. Takes the bad ones that make you 'sick' away. So if you show signs of being sick, they take you to one of the facilities and wipe your memory and then in the end you're happy again and all the bad stuff is gone. (I would rather take one of those kill pills instead of getting my memory wiped.) It's actually pretty original. But seriously. So many geniuses in the world and that's the best they could come up with? Tsss.So the main character in this story is Sloane. She is a really fun character and I loved her. I felt for her and I felt a lot. No kidding. The first part of the book is heartbreaking (the whole book is actually but okay). Her brother died, her best friend doesn't remember her, her other best friend dies and the boy she loves is taken from her too. Yeesh, talk about a hard life. But she is a fighter and she wants to hold on to James as long as she can. She doesn't want to forget. I love her for that. She's strong.The second half of the story is equally heartbreaking and a bit frustrating near the end. If you lose your memories, can you get them back? Does your heart remember what your mind forgot? That's the main question in the second half of the story. And it was so frustrating to know what she did not anymore. But I am sooo glad the way this book ended. And I can't wait for the next book.Oh and I love James. He's awesome and hot. And Realm is ... I don't know, I don't like him.Awesome book, I want the sequel. Like... Yesterday."
"4.5 starsAlthough I didn't expect it to, this book made me feel a lot and in the end, I sighed and smiled. This was such a beautiful story. Both sad and full of hope and love and friendship.Caroline's grandmother is very sick, probably dying. Along with her family, Caroline has been by her side since the stroke. With so much pressure building, all she wants is to escape and when Simone, her best friend, offers to take her to a party on that fateful Friday night, she ends up at a crossroads . Will she stay with her grandma? Or go to the party with Simone? Her decision splits her fate into two different paths and she's about to live them both. But which one is the right one?Oh my god, this boo is just... Epic. It's so damn relatable too. It's insane. The writing is great, I felt so much reading this book. Probably because a lot of people can relate to this. The story has three parts. Before, Stay and Go. First we have Before and after that you have one chapter Stay, the next Go and after that again Stay and so on. I liked the perspective that gave me. We saw how each of the two choices affected her life and family and friends and even love-life. Yeah, maybe it was a bit predictable, but honestly? I don't care. It was just a beautiful, amazing story and it ended just as I hoped it would and that's all that really matters in the end for me.I really liked the characters. Caroline is very easy to relate to. I mean, I know how she felt most of the time because I've been there. I understood it. I loved Simone and Natalie and Teddy and Chris and maybe even Joel. And I loved how everything blended together in the end. So beautiful!Amazing book with more depth to it than I expected at first and written so beautifully. I absolutely recommend this book to everyone who ever lost a loved one and everyone who is fortunate enough to have never gone through that pain.Warning! This book can and probably will make you cry. Especially if you cry easily while reading a book like this. It's a sob-fest, that's for sure. So.. better keep the Kleenex close!"
"Honestly, this is not a genre I usually read. No, correction. This is not a genre I usually enjoy. But I did! I enjoyed this book! Surprisingly so.So, in this book the earth is dying. It's overrun and destroyed by humanity. The 'world government' has terraformed a new planet and is slowly bringing people to that planet. It has several POV's, both on earth and Exilon 5 (the new planet). And each character mattered and had their own voice!We have Bill, a high level government official who doesn't like the natives from the new planet (called Indigene) very much because he thinks they killed his wife. It follows a few natives and a few characters back on earth. The different POV's made it easier for me to get into the story, which is usually very hard for me in this genre. BUT, sometimes it felt like there were to many. Some were necessary, I get that, but some were not and I wouldn't have minded if those didn't have a separate POV.But the story was very fascinating and really original. It's a very good example of the issues that follow when a government has ultimate control over people. And I liked discovering the origins and background from the Indigenes. Very interesting to read. And it never got really predictable. Some parts were, but most of the time it surprised me.It's obvious this is the first part from a trilogy. This book covers most of the world-building and backstory (which is a huge plus) and introduces the characters to us. While doing all that, it makes me curious for the sequel. Very well done Eliza!If you love Sci Fi books or dystopian, you will like (or even love) this one too. I recommend it to them. If this genre is really not your thing, I don't but you might as well give it a try. Who knows, maybe it surprises you and you like it anyway."
"3.5 stars!To be clear, I enjoyed this book. It was pretty good and the characters were awesome, but at times it was a bit... boring. I think some people will compare it to twilight, and it is similar, like so many books are, but this book at least has fun and entertaining Main Characters. And the writing is good. I just would've liked to see more action, more... something. Maybe in the second book?Sunshine is about Sophie. She has an allergy for the sun which means she's almost as pale as Caspar, Snow White or a vampire. At least, that's what the kids at school say. But she doesn't really care anymore. She has two amazing best friends and she can always count on her family. Well most of them anyway. And then Myles comes along. It's clear from the start that something's up with him. He has secrets, but so does Sophie. Both of them have a past they do not wish to share. But as they grow closer, more and more secrets will be revealed.So this story is good and well... Like I said, it was a bit boring. For the most part of the story, nothing really happens. Myles and Sophie get to know each other and their friendship grows and blossoms into something more eventually, but nothing exciting really happens until we hit the 80% mark. If the characters weren't as fun and cool as they were, I wouldn't have given this book the rating I just gave. But it's nice to see a friendship grow into something more between two people. Especially a human and vampire. Yeah, no surprise there. Most of the book is told in the blurb, which made it a bit predictable. Oh and by the way, not to sound like a total geek, but in the above quote... Charmander first evolves into Charmeleon and then Charizard. (Okay yeah, I'm a geek.)I think it's clear that I loved the characters. Sophie is pretty cool. She has a milky white skin, dark magenta hair and wears combat boots. Seriously. Awesome. And yeah, she has issues to deal with from the past, but I get it. There is a depth to her and I liked that. And I loved seeing her growing and learning to care of someone other then her two awesome best friends. Talking about best friends. In this case we have a Korean brother and sister, Boo and Trei (as in peek-a-book and tree). They are soooo cool and funny. And there are some other well-developed side-characters like the stepdad and sisters and high-school barbie bitches. But I hated Sophie's mom. Not exactly mother-of-the-year material. But I really loved Myles! He's a cool vampire and he cares for her. I like the vampires in this book by the way. They're cool.So overall I liked this book. And the ending pretty much made up for the boring parts in the rest of the book. So I'm excited to read the next book sometime in the future! And I do recommend this book to people who love the genre and want to see a relationship that grows for a change. No insta-love in this book! Hurray! But okay. So check this book out people!"
"Wow. I really hoped I would like this book because it's just in my wheel house with the elemental stuff. But you know what? I didn't like this book. Not at all. I F-ing LOVED it! YES you read that right. I just gave 5 stars to a dystopian novel. And everyone who knows me knows that that is pretty rare. Just as rare as someone calling 50 Shades a literary masterpiece.So this is your basic dystopian world (not really). The world is in ruins after a lot of shit has happened and now people live in domes all across the world. It's only safe in those domes and even there life is hard. Avery lives in Dome Four. She's one of the Elementalists, one of the best. She generates steam for the dome. Without steam, no oxygen, no electricity, nothing. But Avery feels more like a pawn than an Elite. And when a man called Riggs offers her a way out, offers her freedom, it's hard to resist. But even there, nothing is what it seems. Even there where she's supposed to be free, are lies.I loved the story. Next to the obvious reason with the elements, it's just a good dystopian book. The writing was really good. I can't really describe it, it just was so fun and nice reading this book. Megan Curd has a very good style of writing. Everything plays like a movie in my head and I love that. The worldbuilding is great. It's not so much you get bored, but not so little you don't understand a thing either. It's just enough and it's great. I got sucked into this story right away. And I just loooove when that happens.Now I've got to talk about some of the characters. Not all of them because of spoilers, but some of them. First off, Avery. Man I love her. She's got some serious spunk. Talk about a kick-ass main character. She's awesome. I loved Alice too. She may seem like a shy and quiet girl, but she's not. She's cool and I like her. Sari too, she's cool. Also pretty kick-ass. And Legs. He's funny and I love him too. And Jaxon. My god. I have a new book boyfriend. Damn.I can't talk about any of the other characters because I would spoil the whole book if I did. And I don't roll that way.Would I read this book again? Hells yeah. Will I read the sequels? Hells yeah. Would I recommend it to anyone? You betcha.This book is perfect for fans of the dystopian genre. Even fans of fantasy will like/love this book. If you're a fan of books with elemental stuff like me, you'll really love this book. So read it. Like... now."
"4.5 stars!I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting and wanting to read this one for months now and when Stephanie said it was ready for beta-reading, I was so happy! Even though it&amp;#8217;s long, like a proper fantasy novel usually is, I really really loved it. So take a deep breath Steph, nothing to fear in this review.The Lost Kingdom takes place in Ilendia and it&amp;#8217;s about Arima, a sixteen year old girl whose world is turned upside down when she finds out she&amp;#8217;s Lady Spirit, one of the five Ladies of Elements. According to a centuries old Prophecy, she has to unite all the five Ladies and save Ilendia and the Other Lands from Ahriman, the Demon King. Even though Arima has no choice but accept the destiny she never even wanted and go on a journey into the unknown.The Lost Kingdom was originally published in Dutch and Stephanie wanted to take it to the next level and started translating it herself so more people were able to read it and yes, she&amp;#8217;s going indie! She has been working very hard on this for months now and I&amp;#8217;ve been helping wherever I can. I&amp;#8217;m sort of a PR person for her, a beta reader,&amp;#8230; But above all, her best friend. And honestly, I was terrified I wouldn&amp;#8217;t like it that much because it would break my heart if I had to write a negative review. Luckily, I loved it!This has everything a good YA Fantasy book needs. A cool, brilliant world? Check! A strong, pretty bad ass heroine? Check! A scary, evil villain? Check! Mystery, Magic and more of that good stuff? Check, check and check! Plus I did get a lot of feels from it too! Especially in the beginning and at the end. And elemental magic powers!! That&amp;#8217;s the thing I loved the most because I love it when a book has that. The world Stephanie created was amazing and in the Dutch copy there is a map, but the one that made it left out some of the most important cities so it&amp;#8217;s not very helpful. I don&amp;#8217;t know if there will be a map in the English book too, but if not, you&amp;#8217;ll have to use your imagination. And Stephanie does a good job at helping you with that. The whole land/world was in my head!Of course, with Fantasy sometimes comes strange words. And there are some in this one too. Creatures I didn&amp;#8217;t know because they were made up, a language that was also made up. There is a legend at the end with all the meanings of those words and names, but I think I pronounce them very, very wrong in my head so. That&amp;#8217;s a bit confusing, but I got used to it. And most Fantasy books I know (like the ones from James Clemens, Robin Hobb, Terry Goodkind,&amp;#8230;) are very long and this one is too in my opinion. It has 332 pages in the beta stage and before you say that that&amp;#8217;s not long at all, it is because these are normal pages in the PDF format. So if she would print it out, that&amp;#8217;s how many standard sized pages there would be. So it&amp;#8217;s long, but that&amp;#8217;s not a bad thing because Stephanie really takes her time to develop this story and its characters. Yeah it can get a little, tiny bit boring. BUT, there&amp;#8217;s a but! Just when you&amp;#8217;re starting to feel like putting the book down, something happens that hooks you again and you&amp;#8217;re back on track!I really loved Arima. She really grows a lot in this book and I like that. She doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be Lady Spirit at first and denies everything. But then something happens and she&amp;#8217;s forced to flee from her village and she has to grow up pretty quick and learn more about these new powers she has. And she can really kick some ass if she needs too. The battle at the end is pretty epic. It&amp;#8217;s not very long, but the book is, so appreciated the fact that Stephanie didn&amp;#8217;t drag the battle out just to make it longer. And on her journey she meets several fun characters. Blythe, Myrddin, Laguun, &amp;#8230; And of course her unicorn, Sirrim. No it&amp;#8217;s not as lame as it sounds, the unicorn is also pretty bad ass.So if you&amp;#8217;re looking for an awesome YA Fantasy book in the style of James Clemens, Terry Goodkind (and more), this is a good choice! I really loved it and I can&amp;#8217;t wait to see what happens next!"
"Great design! The installation was so simple. It definitely makes the car look less like an RC car. Product quality was better than what I was expecting."
"What a great book.  It was recommended by a friend and I enjoyed it tremendously.  Adam Brown, although started out with troubles, showed that if you put your mind to it anything can be accomplished."
"I think it is great.  I do like that it is written in real language.  Not like Anne of Green Gables.  I read so I do not have to watch tv or listen to it.  It is my quiet time.  I get involved and it is nice to read this.  It is easy to follow.  I think most any one that likes a little mystery would like this."
"Excellent.  Exactly what the ad said.  Couldn't be happier! :-) They are not  cheap like others I have bought.  Recommend!"
"I'm so glad I got to read this book. It's absolutely amazing and mind-blowing masterpiece. I admire Randy very much and I admire him even more and more by reading more of his books or any other stuff. I can say it's absolutely must read for every human on this earth and will tell you why.This book hit on me from the very start and I have to admit that I started to write this review even though I haven't finished the book yet. That is because I really want to share my excitement about this book with you. Don't worry I will finish this review only after I will finish the book. There is not much left. The message Randy shares with us is very controversial and eye-opening. Many of you might be shocked and don't agree with the author, but that doesn't change the reality Randy want to show us. The question is why you're dumb, sick and broke? The answer lies in those pages. Everything depends on how you are going to use the information. I found this information extremely priceless and it really helped me to understand why certain things are happening in my life. Knowing this I can act and change things I don't like to create my dream future. I believe you can do the same.One part of this book tells you why most people are not happy with their lives, yet another explains what should you do or don't to fix the situation. That is the beautiful part of it. There are certain laws of wealth and prosperity that you will find in this book. Using them you have a chance to create your desire life. I loved those examples Randy gives in his book, I really love the way he does that, because every example is quite controversial and that forces you to think, and I believe this is one of the reasons this book was written. One of my favorite parts was a imaginable story about new settlers on an island after the plane crash. By reading that story you can exactly see why people are acting in a certain way in this world and what is more important is that you can make a choice, how you want to act in your own life.I can't share all my excitement about this book in this short review, because I would just have to rewrite all of it. That's not my purpose. I just can assure you that this book is one of my most valuable books ever read.Why you have to read this book? The answer is simple: because nobody want to be dumb, sick or broke. And if you struggle in any or all of these ares it might be a sigh that you don't know or understand something. And if you are good in all of those ares this book will help you to strengthen you position and belief. So there are no any excuses why you shouldn't read it, except you have already done that."
"This book will take you on a very unusual journey through the mind of one of the most important people on human psychology in history - father of analytical psychology Carl Gustav Jung.The book that is not easy to read even though it supposed to be an autobiography. And it is, just most of the times it looks like an unusual biography and seems like it was written about the life within the author's mind. This book is my first meeting with C. G. Jung and I should admit that there were parts where I didn't understand exactly what he had in mind. Probably I will have to read it once more in a few years after I'll read more of his works. But I liked it, because it portrays very interesting personality, who spend all his life studying human psychology and basically creating most of today well know psychology works and practices. I am very interested in psychology and it's always very interesting to know the basics.What is interesting in this book, that you can be acquainted with both parts of Jung's life - his life events and his inner life, his mind and thoughts. Both parts are very interesting - his childhood, early years, school, studies, work as a psychiatrist, relationships, trips and so on. Another part is more difficult and as I mentioned above it's not so easy to perceive. Jung talks about his dreams, visions, reflections, that sometimes really seem very crazy. That's why this personality is so interesting to me.I believe you should be ready to read this book and probably you will have to read it couple of times in couple of year's period. If you are interested in human psychology, behavior and philosophical personalities, I believe you will like this book as well.I will finish my review with one of Jung's thoughts that caught my eye in the end: &amp;#34;We become lonely not when we don't have close people, but when we can't share things with them that seems important to us or when we hold on the attitude that is not acceptable to others&amp;#34;."
"Apes are holding Einsteins by the ropes in both fighting sides. The same apes are trying to create a new society after the nuclear war. The same apes are living by the fictitious savage dogmas. No questioning, just a blind belief in what is created to be an absolute true. How much human is left there in the society?Aldous Huxley is really very talented philosophical writer. Ape And Essence is his second book I've read after Brave New World. As I've expected, this book made a huge impression on me. I admire author's ability to create great stories and show the world in the most deep philosophical way. I like this book very much, because it reminds us what it means to be human. Author beautifully paints world based on created norms that nobody knows where they came from but takes it as an absolute true.This time Huxley takes us to the future after the nuclear world war. From the surface this book looks different from Brave New World, but actually it's the same insane life, where nobody is really living their own life. It shows us empty post-apocalyptic world where only few survivors are left and are trying to create society again. Everything is told through the eyes of the scientist who came from New Zealand, the only country which was not touched by the war.Interesting fact is that author takes a scientist who looks like he is still living in our known today world and puts him in the conditions of the future post-apocalyptic world, where people are building a society on savage totalitarian and religious fundamentals. And that looks so unacceptable and inappropriate through his eyes, as well as through the readers' eyes. But if you look more deeper, you might see that the world we are living today is not much different, most people are so used to the dogmas, values, routines and imposed norms that most just take them as an absolute true even though sometimes they feel that it doesn't have any meaning to them and just makes them live by the inertia. And here the question rises, is the imagination of the Huxley just a fantasy, or is it a reality just made up with a different make-up?Another interesting thing that I've noticed while reading this book is that those people used books just as firewood to cook and satisfy similar needs. This is not the first book where I've noticed such behavior with books. The misuse of the books was pictured in Brave New World and in Orwell's 1984 as well. I believe these authors want to show that reading books is one of the greatest ways to grow in life and nobody from those stories was interested in this fact. It's sad, but even in our world most people don't use their reading abilities at all, they just forget that and I believe it's equal to using the books as firewood.So how much ape do you have inside you?"
"Do you know math? Languages? Geography? Chemistry or any other science? Have you ever studied in school, college or university? Did you have lessons of getting rich science? No? Well, this book might be one of the most important in your life!The Science Of Getting Rich is one of the root books, which established the principles, that all other self-help, getting rich, success or self-development books used later on and are still using these days. I've read many books on this topic and I really admire this book, because it's short, everything is concentrated and presented beautifully simple. Don't take me wrong, many books teach us how to do certain things in the best way. They are very important if you want to be successful in the sphere you are in. This book is about the concept of what you need to become rich and successful in life and these principles can be implemented in whatever you do. Though, you will still need the certain knowledge about the thing you are doing in life.I've read this book couple of times. It was one of the first books, which I've read more than a year ago. I've read a lot of other books before I came back to this book again. Very powerful, I can say that everything in The Science Of Getting Rich is very potent! The book is involving and addictive from the very beginning. First chapter - The Right TO Be Rich. Strait away the author talks about human nature right to be rich and to have the things that make life to be fulfilling. I believe many people might judge him because of his point of view, but as he says himself, it's just the excuses for laziness.If you are struggling or looking for something in life, I greatly recommend you this book, I believe you will have a clue where to start!So, do you have an excuse for not being rich?"
"Hi guys, I am Aistis and was following Randy Gage for some time. I got a chance (thank you Randy) to read his new book, which is coming on 30th of October, beforeit is released. I was shocked, amazed and fascinated of the vision Randy shares with us. This book is much different from many success literature, it is something different I even expected from Randy. The main message Randy wants to share in this book is to cause us to think. In this book he does not tell us anything what or how to think, by telling all those thing he just causes us to think. And in my mind that is the reason this book is a must read for everybody who can read letters!!!Risky is the new safe sound really strange for many people, it simply denies everything we were taught to know. But it is TRUE. World have changed and rules of life have changed and now no lifestyle is safe until it is RISKY. Life tempo is getting faster and faster and many people never stop to see what is coming and what are those changes bringing them - problems or opportunities. And in my opinion this is one of the reasons why you guys should really get a copy of this book for yourself and for ones you love. For some of you it will be shocking and mindblowing. Others will find the answers to their questions like I did. Some of you guys will get a million dollar idea. I believe there will be ones that will throw this book in the corner after reading. I think every choice is acceptable, but give yourself a chance to see the world upside down.Prepare to get a lot of information that is unusual to you. You will choose to believe it or not, to admit it or resist. The fact is many things will happen despite of our will and our role is to see an opportunity in whatever is happening!!!I would like to share with you my favourite Randy's message: ""You must be willing to let go of who you are to become who you are meant to be"", - Randy GageEnjoy your reading guys!!"
"Atheistic look to the human being. The author, Julien Offray de La Mettrie, explores the theory of human flash and soul being indivisible and basically operating as a machine. Following that, all human behavior and existence is explained on the basis of physics and chemistry.A book written more than 260 years ago. Sincerely, it was one of the most difficult books to read even it's quite short. I can't say that I liked it and can't say that I didn't. It is just a lot different from all the other literature I've been reading so far. Still I'm very glad I read this book. It showed me more how people were thinking and creating different ideas and theories about human existence hundreds of years ago. Actually it is interesting that the author had so much courage to publish such a work back in those days. Nowadays religion is not as strong as it was 260 years ago and the book is very against the dogmas of church.I really like authors thought that the human is what he eats. I think it is a lot true, because what you eat defines how you feel, and how you feel most likely to define how you act what leads to what results you get in life. This entire journey is most likely to show who you are.Do you have any thoughts? Share your opinion!"
"Have you ever thought that in order to stay healthy one of the choices might be to avoid doctors and drugs as much as possible? Sounds strange, but it might be a solution! Heath is a sensitive topic and ask yourself honestly, how much do you know about it (I mean know, not imagine or have somebody else's opinion as yours)? Do you think that the goal of pharmacy industry is to help people? As a business owner I will tell you that the main goal of business is profit. Everything else might be just the second!Health is one of the most serious issues to many people. Doctors, hospitals, drugs and other health related things are very important in life for most people. The main question is how much do we really know about this sphere? And how much do we trust authorities that are in this field? Most people don't pay too much attention to their health until something goes wrong with them. And after this happens most people simply blindly trust any kind of doctor thinking that he knows what is the best for them. It might be true that most doctors should know more about health than we do, but there comes another very important question - if they are trusted so much to know what's better for us, might there be a manipulation of that knowledge? It's a very serious question that most people never ask themselves.This book is written by a man who spent many years working for the pharmacy companies and his claim is that most of those companies simply work for profits and do many evil things to achieve it. He describes his experience of doing unmoral things himself. Of course, most facts still can't be approved by the certain evidences and sometimes this story even might sound like one of conspiracy theories, but still it raises many serious questions.You might read this book and take everything as an absolute true or you can read it and take it as an absolute nonsense. It's your choice and you will have certain outcomes by making your decision. Or it is possible to read this book and make a critical thinking of what might be true and why it might be true. I personally take the information in the book more as true than as nonsense. The reason for that is that everything what I see around is more likely to claim the story than to deny it.One of the chapters is about artificially made diseases. It's not about creating physical viruses (I believe that is possible as well), it's more about creating what I call mind viruses. It's when you put a fear into society's minds about some illness and suddenly you come up with the cure for that. In such case most people get sick (mentally) and buy cure even they have never needed that if they've never knew that. And this is one of those things that I really see around by myself. Even this makes the information in the book consider more correct that incorrect. You should be blind if you don't see all those ads on TV, streets, screens of various drugs. I don't need them, but most people simply do, because they see and believe. Another question that I ask myself is what is the pharmacy industry really capable of? And what is it is just showing us?Your thoughts. Are you sick just because there is a cure for your illness?"
"Today is science fiction of yesterday and tomorrow is science fiction of today.Hot air balloons, zeppelins, bird-men, first attempts to fly, parachutes, first planes, first airlines, spaceships, trips to the space, future of air travelling and much much more you will be able to know going through the pages of Reach For The Skies.Reach For The Skies is a beautifully written history of the evolution of the men's attempts, fails and successes to conquer the skies. The author of the book is my favorite billionaire Sir Richard Branson. As he loves to fly himself, it is very interesting to see this history of the airship through his eyes. I really enjoyed finding out how all that what we now have in air traffic was developed. Branson presents the facts in a very nice way where you can see people's visions, attempts, persistence, fails, successes and finally where all that led to.Not much time have passed since first attempts to fly were made. It's only a little more than two hundred years since first hot air balloon lifted from the ground and now we already have spaceships, which can fly to other planets. The same is with the travelling speed. It changed dramatically in just a couple of decades. Everything developed so fast, that it's hard to imagine where we are going to be in another one hundred years. Branson himself established the company called Virgin Galactic, which can take you to the space and everybody can become an astronaut. It's already possible!It's also a huge opportunity for new businesses. It might be difficult for many of you to see it in a business way, but some people are already doing it. As I mentioned before one of them is Richard Branson. Moreover, space hotel is being made for those who want to spend some time watching the earth from the skies. Many other opportunities are opening and author gives us a look through all the history to the future. One more interesting fact I found out in this book was that the first airlines were established even before first airplanes were really made to fly. That's the vision! Now is the next step. All of that you will be able to read in Reach For The Skies.So where is your ceiling? The Moon? The Mars? or maybe something much bigger.."
"The book written by Sir Richard Branson himself. It's not his first book which I had a chance to read. Yet Losing My Virginity is one of the best books I've read in my life so far. Richard is one of my inspiring personalities and probably that's why for me this book is even more special. I believe, everyone, who has big dreams and want them to come true should read about how virginity is really lost.Losing My Virginity title was chosen not accidentally. One of the reasons was to make a catchy title for the book, to attract more attention and in my opinion it played out very well. Another reason is that the empire created by Richard is called Virgin. To sum up all that, this book is very worth reading, and it's not the title that makes it unforgettable - it's the real story, that makes this book epic!And the story begins with Richard's childhood. If you think that rich people are born, you are wrong. Author himself wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He had to earn everything himself and that journey wasn't simple. Getting into those pages you will find how Richard started, developed, almost collapsed couple of times, struggled, fought and finally made the impossible.What I love the most is the story itself. For me it was inspiring, motivating and forcing to think big. Never stay satisfied only with small things and always keep looking for the things that truly matter. I admire Richard's attitude to life. He was always trying to have fun in business, always prove that everything is possible, and when you read this book it seems that the word ""impossible"" simply don't exist in the dictionary.I like that Richard is really open in this book. He wrote not only about business but also about his love adventures, women and sex. Moreover, this story reveals fights for the true, reputation and honor. It's so involving that I couldn't put it away until I knew the end.I believe, everybody will find a lot of priceless advises, ideas and courage in this book. If you'll read it with an open mind, I believe the word ""impossible"" will start to disappear from your life!So what is your story of losing your virginity?!"
"I am following Big Al for already about 2 years. I also had a chance to be in life event where he was one of the speakers. Since then I like this person a lot, because of his charisma and funny way to present the information. Getting to read this book was really a pleasure for me. I read it in one sip, because of the same easy and not boring style that Big Al has.I can proudly recommend this book to all people developing network marketing business in any range. It's very easy to read and to understand the material. Big Al knows how to make things simpler and easier and I believe that most people involved in network marketing can learn many thing from this man. The next step after reading this book is to implement the information presented in it. And that's way more easier when using the stories method explained in the book.I was having different struggles building my business and still have some. I believe this book will really help me to improve my business. So, if you are struggling developing your network marketing business, make yourself a favor and get this book!"
"I usually don't read books like this and that's probably the reason why I gave it just 3 stars. I usually look something that I could take for myself from the book. I don't want to say that there is nothing to take from this book, but it's not much. For me this story is more like romance and struggle in love story than a story of human transformation and finding something meaningful in life. It's a classic story of bad boy and innocent girl who finally find each other and the bad boy changes to good side. Many movies are made on this topic and many books are written as well. I usually look for more meaningful lessons or stories in the books.Reading this book it usually seemed that I'm reading some Gothic theme literature, more likely to be some vampire story. It's too much darkness in this book. I understand that it's a novel and it's creative work, but I'm looking from the perspective of what I can learn from this book. And as I mentioned above it's too much to read all this book, just to understand that you are the only one to fight your darkness within.I could recommend this book for people who like dramatic love stories, vampire love stories or similar - you might find it interesting, but as a literature of human transformation and lessons in life, sorry, there are much better books on that purpose."
"Jim Carrey is really a great actor. I personally admire him more in comedies, but this movie proved that he could play any role in acting. I saw The Number 23 couple of times. It made me a big impression then I saw this film the first time, because I didn't know anything what was going to happen and the most interesting thing is that the movie kept the tension all the time till the end. Even in the end of the movie, when everything became more clear, there raised a new question - &amp;#34;why&amp;#34;, which kept the tension even more longer.The idea of this movie is mystical. The name of the film tells us a small hint - number 23. Everything what happens in this movie is connected to this number and the main character (Jim Carrey) gets obsessed with this thing. His obsession evolves to actions what finally ends in a very unexpected way.I was trying to look at this situation logically. From the experience I've got and the books I've read I know that everything is possible to explain in reasonable way. One of the facts is that we see what we want to see and where we concentrate our attention. Moreover, it depends on what is usually going on in our heads. After watching this movie, couple next days I saw number 23 couple of times. I payed attention to that, that's why I saw it. I didn't count the times I saw other numbers those days and that doesn't mean that number 23 was following me.Wish you a great watching! If you like mystics, this movie is exactly for you!"
"There are a lot of games and toys in this world, but Cashflow is one of the most intelligent game of them all. By playing this game you can get a lot of financial knowledge that was skipped in your standard education. I enjoy playing this game every time, because it's a great way to spend time with friends not just having fun, but learning new and very valuable skills and knowledge as well. I recommend this game to everyone, because it's a must when it comes to everyone's finances!"
"The information presented in this writing is useful and I believe many people starting network marketing business could find something that could help them to start business better. What I didn't like about this is calling it a book. For me it's more like a blog post or a information brochure, but definitely not a book. I missed explanations, more analysis and advises. More examples would helped as well."
"Great game fun and challenge.  Fun for everyone.  Recommend it because everyone can play regardless of their age.  Get it."

"This book would be a pleasure for most young readers, but I think it would be especially appropriate for kids with brothers or sisters. While Mea has magical powers and her older brother, Matthew (from the author's previous book,) doesn't, he and his friend Lily need to stop the mischievous little girl from causing more problems.  Can they stop her, or will she learn on her own to do what's right?"
"I got these for my 5 year old girls. I decided to get a size 10 for my girl that usually wears a size 7 to 8 in pants and is 56 pounds. She was wearing a size 8 brief in fruit of the loom and they were too big on her, but due to the other reviews of them being on the small size I decided to get the size 10. They fit great! They looked a little big at first, but after washing them they fit perfect.I got a size 8 for my other girl. She was wearing a size 6 in fruit of the loom briefs and size 6X to 7 in pants..she weighs about 50 pounds. They also fit her perfectly. Definitely be aware of the sizing, as they are running smaller than others. The material is a little thin, but my girls say they are very comfortable."
"I bought these for my 9 year old boy. He wears size 3 shoes. These socks fit him extremely well and he says they are comfortable. They are not too tight or too lose....perfect. The material is pretty thick and I assume will last a while. I will definitely buy these again."
"I ordered (Juniors Large, 4 Pack: Magenta/Navy/Plum/Jade) for my 10 year old. She usually wears a size 11 in juniors. She loves the colors and they appear to be well made. They are fairly long which is a plus because she will be wearing these as undershirts. They arrived 2 days before the estimated arrival date. I will be buying these again!"
"I would definitely recommend this! The hay was fresh and it's a great deal. This will last my guinea pig a while. Be prepared....the hay was not separated or baled inside the box, but it was not strung out everywhere either. It was placed fairly neatly. I received the box before the estimated arrival date."

However it was a gift for a nephew out of state, so I had to purchase the remote so he had something to play with the xbox. Basically, I wasted money on buying a remote when the bundle came with one. The xbox worked great though. Nephew was very happy"

"Very happy with my new little Bissell Little Green cleaner.  I had so much upholstery to clean, that I have used it over and over.  It works great, does a great job, is lightweight enough, and easy to figure out and use.  Only suggestion is that the accordian tubing to the appliances could be a little longer."
"We are finally getting organized thanks to these cute little units.  Well made and very pretty to look at.  Easy to assemble as well.  Very satisfied."

"What can you say about ... the ""Love Story"" hope and sadness and love endures. A wonderful book. Read it."
"The crate itself is made well, they just designed it poorly.  The clips that hold everything together in alignment are all placed incorrectly.  They could go an inch either way and hit nothing, but they seem to have been placed right in line with cross members of the wire frame on the front panel and properly placed on the rear panel.  So, they hit the wires and distort the front door so badly that it's a pain to open and close.  I would not buy one again without trying it out in person to ensure everything aligns properly.  Who knows what it is that creates the inconsistency (new welder, bad machine alignment, poor quality reviewer), or whether it's just a problem with my unit, but it's maddening."

"I have used Pinnacle for years and found it very user friendly.  Now they come out with Studio 16 Ultimate. It is a miserable excuse for a home editing program.  I render the film and export it only to have it freeze and say it has experienced a problem or it keeps exporting but a large X appears and continues through the rest of the movie.  I have found no way of working around these issues.  I went to their site as suggested in a blog and downloaded any updates suggested and was seriously optimistic.  Great, now instead of the X appearing, the program simply freezes and reports the ""experience problem.""  I even went so far as to cut out the offending segment, eliminated any transitions, titles, etc. but the program simply freezes in a new spot.If you think that this product is supported, forget it. You can pay some wizard for help or drink magic kool aid.  You cannot even figure out their manual which is about as large War and Peace but it does not seem to be of any value either."
"Holds my Harley Road King no problem! Loading my bike in my pickup is easy because you ride up and into the Condor stand and step off the bike.

"Got a Droid RazrM and an Otter Box for it. Phone fits without the protective case but with the Otter Box, no way will it fit.However, I put my camera in it and it stays on the tank no problem at 65 mph."
"Recently, specifically bought this grinder as it was non-aluminum and certainly not cheap plastic. Never owned a grinder longer than a week, always broke down herbs by hand. A cheap basterd, im very picky when it comes to buying things I really dont 'need' must have great reviews or I wont touch it. I consider myself an average partaker, 6-10 sessions a day, in short order, this grinder is well worth every penny. Grinds herbs to a perfect size, pollen trap works great, easy assembly, good weight. Only flaw of this grinder... the magnet holding the top to the grinder is not very powerful, tip it sideways or upside down &amp; the magnet will fail. Hold upright. Wash metal shavings out."
"Die hard westwood studios fan. EA butchered C&amp;C do NOT buy this. Get it for free someplace if you can but do not waste money on this horsemanure."
"They work great but beware that there are 2 (two) different styles of glass 'daisy' screens. One just looks like a daisy, without a stem if you will. The other has a looks like a daisy with a stem. I currently have both styles on accident. I find the screens without the stem fair better than the others. The stem seems to block the pipe hole, not really useful to me."
"This has a great aroma to it. Very calming and is a great product. I buy all my E.Os from here. (So far.. no problems) . If you have a very hyperactive child like I do .. BUY THIS NOW. It true is a life saver. Calmed my son within 15 mins it was amazing"
"I like this case and it works great BUT i am giving this a 4 star because on my sleep/lock button it doesnt fit right. apparently the 4s is a little bigger than the 4 and i have the 4s. it will probably fit perfectly with an iphone 4"
"way overpriced if you want a fire that cost 13.00 just throw your money in the fire place no way"
"The black portion does come off fairly easily when the case is not on the phone, but when it is on the phone the two components of the case fit together quite nicely. It's a slim case with good protection capability."
"This series is my childhood and the most amazing adventure to read! This final book was the most perfect ending and tied everything together well!"
"I reread these books all the time. They are my childhood. I have no other words except amazing. I strongly suggest everybody to read them."
"Love it! light weight, and does the job.  I have a larger swiss army knife in my tool case, but where can you find one so small with scissors."
"Love Them!big, soft and they dry you off FAST!Highly recommend to anybody that wants a quality bath towel.Parboy"
"See review #1.  Too bad it has to end, someday!  Perhaps, the children can take over when Walt is finally brought down.  Will he be brought down?"
"I hate this monitor, wish I would have never wasted $200 on it. My first problem with it is that it times out every 15 minutes. why in the world would you have a baby monitor time out, the point of the monitor is to watch your baby ALL night, how on earth do you expect me to watch over my baby if im constantly having to log in, so I had to buy a second monitor TOTAL WASTE. my second problem is if you try to log back in too fast it doesnt work you have to go completely out of the ap and start over. I wouldnt recommend this monitor to anyone and have already warned multiple people not to waste their money."
"Mattress is a little expensive to me, so I decided to buy a sleeping bag instead. This bag is amazing! Big enough, with high quality. There is no reason to refuse it."

"SUPERSHIELDZ is very good"
"I have always liked Tina Fey and this book revealed a lot about how she thinks and what she is about.  I find her writing style very entertaining and enjoyed the book very much."
"I think it's funny that there are so many negative reactions to the ending; it is really the only way that the series could end.  Both books in the beginning of the trilogy lead up to exactly what happened (to a point of being predictable), and anything other than Tris sacrificing herself as she did would have been out of character.  The book was well done in that it answered a lot of questions, and showed us some insight into Tobias which was interesting.  Good book, not as bad as people are making it seem in the comments/reviews.  It is written for it's target audience (YA), and it stays true to character."
"I ordered my textbook online through Amazon and it worked out great. My book arrived in a timely manner, it was in the condition described (some highlighting and writing, but nothing too bad) and I was able to save money by avoiding the book store on campus."
"I would give this product 0 stars, if that were an option. This was a waste of money and a waste of time. For a fee, it will do the exact same thing and a google search for a tv show or channel would. As for the ""Live TV""... I couldn't seem to get it to work at all. I am going to try a return this and get my money back. Some much time wasted on this stupid little thing..."
"This is the 3 rd one I have had but this one is the best I have neck and spine problemsHave found this to be a great help even slept on my back which I have never done for yearsSo I am ever so pleased with it and would recommend this Topping for anyone to try theyWill love it as I doPeter Bell"

"This game was purchased on accident, by my youngest daughter.  It has been a huge hit with the entire family.  The zombies are not too ugly and it is a fun game."
"Was delivered on time, and easy to install. Came in handy cause I purchased a Mac and I started college so I need Microsoft and the others so its worth the money. I also like the new features it comes with."
"I made the mistake of putting it in the dryer...don't do that...it's best to have it line dry or you will have to iron it to get it back to it's design size"
"Game is slow to earn credits and minimum purchase is 100 gems. A little too high, but game itself is ok."
"I purchased the wrong item and the supplier kindly worked with me and offered another similar product.  I received the new earhooks quickly and I love them.  I really appreciated working with the supplier and will do so in the future.  Thank you again for your promptness and consideration."

"I heard about PLL from friends and I decided to read it. Now I'm reading the second book and I'm in love with it!"

"Lot of great advice to help family member who does not want to take their medication.  The book gave lots of insights and ways to help.  Easy reading  and practical tips.  I would recommend it to anyone who is having problems with a loved one who will not stay on their medication."
"This was a gift. They enjoy it. Said it was really nice and worked good. Just wished I had more choices in color."
"I ordered these for my daughters school project and they were exactly what I wanted. they are the perfect size and look fantastic. very pleased with this product."

"The chair has ridges sewn across the back that are not padded and the ridges cut into your back and I rarely use itand the massage unit in the footstool does'nt work at all, something wrong with the wiring.I am very sorry that I bought it."
"I bought this for my home, liked it so much I purchased another for the office I run as well for staff.My husband and I are new to juicing, this is cheap enough for us since we were skeptical and easy enough to clean and maintain. I followed the food instructions on what to cut up verses putting in whole as well as the cleaning instructions. Very simple, we use it twice per day as meal replacements - have already lost weight and overall feel better.The same juicer I got for the office is used at least five times per day, same thing everyone follows the food and cleaning instructions exactly, a month later with heavy use it is still like new. I highly recommend this item, great experience so far."
"Have been buying this brand for 20 years and the product keeps getting better.  We love this mattress pad and it's new design.  The plug-in is at the head of the bed (rather than at the foot), and each side has it's own circuit (rather than wired in parallel).  The plug in is on the vertical side (rather than on top, like many other brands), so it is out of sight and feeling.Can't feel the heating wires at all.  Agree with others that the highest setting (10) is WAY too warm, but you will soon learn what works for you.  My husband heats up his side on 4, while I use a toastier 7-8 setting.  Within 10 minutes of being in bed, I usually shut it off, as my body heat is enough to keep me comfortable.This is a really good investment and I highly recommend it.  No drawbacks at all."
"I really enjoyed reading it for being the 3rd book in the series, Michael Grant kept the story line alive and I liked reading it."
"This book was just as good as the others in the series. I love it and this stupid thing requires a certain number of words....blah"

"One of the best books I have ever read about starting a global business. I can not stop reading it. As a neo- writing. think member, I understand and knows what the author is writing. I would recommend this book to all who are thinking of starting a global business."

"The written features meet the fact. Waterproof, slip resistant, and puncture features are proven. Excellent choice for professional miners in Indonesia. Horas ma"
"Story ended too abrupt.Many people were involved in the story, i.e. Cody, Bailey, Ashley and family, but none of the individual stories had an ending."

"I used to want this lotion so bad a couple years ago but I never did because it was so expensive. Well now I finally got it when it was a lot cheaper and it works awesome. It smells like Tommy Hilfiger. (yummy) and it always made me have a great tan!"
"Not sure how to use it. It is a pain in the ass if you ask me. If your good with hair you might understand it. it looks kind of granny also when its in your hair."

"Who doesn't enjoy a classic John Wayne movie?  I ordered this classic for my father in-law. It is one of our favorite John Wayne classics."
"I was very satisfied with this durable jewelry holder. It works very well for size 14G jewelry. I have all my jewelry neatly organized and now I don't have to go through the frustrations of losing my body jewelry. I use this for navel rings and it securely holds all the barbells in place. I am very satisfied with this product and I do plan on ordering from this company again."
"It freezes a lot and does it's own thing. I don't like it at all. Trying to talk my mom into returning it."
"As my first pair of bike shorts, they are comfortable but a little restricting.  It's nice to finally have some padding, but I don't feel as if the padding is ample or made of the best material.  At this price range though, they are well worth it."
"I've had my eye on these sleeping bags for a while and finally decided to buy them (one left &amp; one right zipper) for camping this summer... It was by far the best purchase I could have made! I was worried that it might be a tight squeeze for two people and that we wouldn't be able to move much. Boy was I wrong! I have a queen air mattress and when these sleeping bags are zipped together, they actually hang off the side of the bed. They are fairly light weight but completely warm. Between an air mattress and these sleeping bags it was like sleeping on a cloud. Everyone who camped with us wants one now. I would recommend this sleeping bag to anyone."
"Very disappointed. I knew that I had been HAD when I was reading through and saw that publishers in this booked accepted CASSETTES! Really?...... As I did more research I found that people listed as &amp;#34;producers&amp;#34; were in fact NOT. One name I already knew and the person is a vocal coach.....Its sad really. Writer/Editor of this book: very unprofessional...... Do not waste your money..........."
"LOVE THIS CREAM.......I was very upset when the glycolic acid cream I was using was no longer available.. I stumbled onto this one..LOVE IT.....Hope this company stays in business for a long time"
"GREAT GAME! Stunning graphics, runing 1080p at 60fps. PS4 is more powerful? Oh I'm sorry, last time I checked drive club runs a sad 30fps."
"It does not work I give it no stars charger won't work when I charge my phne when I try to charge the charger does not work"
"A good horror movie. But not a great Halloween movie. The studio had intended for Michael Myers to remain dead and start a different direction with the series in which each movie had a different plot and villain, it did not work and so they brought Mikey back in the fourth installment. But THIS, Season of The Witch, is what we got from that brief time of insanity. As I said, it's a good '80s horror movie, but a bad Halloween movie."
"I was pleased with the condition it was in when I received it, but this movie is awful. Even White as the villain couldn't make up for the crap they shove down your throat in this movie."
"I hate headlines.. Great season of a great show and it was in perfect condition. I love it! More Power"
"Great season, great show. Said it was used but it was in original wrapping when I received it. Great buy."
"Great movie! Action packed and kind of campy which is something I personally like every once in a great while."
"Great crossover series. Great blu ray set (Even if it is just the individual releases in a sleeve). Recommended for fans of Alien especially as the story in these seems to follow the Alien franchise more than Predator. I don't suppose there was much to go on as far as story arc from the Predator movies, although a Schwarzenegger cameo would have been graciously accepted by THIS guy."
"Pretty good show (even if they did mess up some major Superman canon) and this set is AMAZING!!! All kinds of extras and little things like the newspaper and an episode guide (I believe). I got it for my brother for Christmas so I'm not sure about everything in it but it seems pretty cool to me."
"Great song. I love all things Bond (Even Die Another Day) and when I first heard this new song I thought, &amp;#34;Yes! Finally a good old fashioned (yet somehow still new age) Bond theme. And it's by Adele! That will DEFINITELY score me points with the ladies if I start listening to Adele!!&amp;#34; It has yet to score me any points with the ladies. Besides this song and that one about defying the laws of physics by lighting water on fire, it has mostly just annoyed me. But I'm getting sidetracked... Great song! Good going, Adele, you're not completely useless."
"I read this book in one sitting, it was too hard to stop.  I felt like if I stopped reading and picked it up at a different time it wouldn't have had as much of an impact on me. This book made me feel more emotions in its 213 pages than in any other book I've read.  And it was so relatable!Best money I've spent in a while, worth the read definitely!"
"I believe that this book fit my needs just fine. It was very cheap and it was in good condition, as it was said to be."
"This product is great for suppressing your appetite, which ultimately keeps you focused on your weight loss goals. I find that if I take one pill in the morning then I am not hungry for the day. I usually have to force myself to eat something. I combine these pills along with the Ultra Pure Green Coffee Bean, a product also sold by this company.I am truly pleased with the result of this product. So pleased that after finishing my first bottle of each, I email NatureWise to brag about my success with their product. The customer service IS THE BEST. They care about their customers and they are super supportive.There have been nothing but good experiences all around with this product, Friendly employees and an awesome product!If you love the product after trying it, then you too can contact the company and then hey will ship you a free body of the product."
"The one I have is way too loud, even after I tried covering the speaker with 3 layers of duct tape to dull the volume. I can't stand for it to be played with because it's obnoxiously loud and I don't want it to damage our ears!"
"I am thrilled to give Some Swamis are Fat five stars! I was continually impressed with Ava Green's big scope - she goes to the spiritual left, always holding the big picture, with possibility and kindness. She off-handedly zings into what's universally correct with writing that's loony and sensible at the same time. You wind up with an authenticity and warmth that befriend you to the book."
"I think Psychostick needs more albums :)I like everything they put out.They need to play shows in Providence so i can see them."
"It`s trendy and I has the most important thing that is to protect the IPADJust is easy to get dirty..."
"Very happy with everything I brought thru Amazon. Good quality my grand daughter s love every items I got with the dolls. Thank you very much"
"First I would like to thank Amazon for all the help and information plus the wish list feature. You found me a unit with ease ofuse at a price that I could afford. I am a recent student of the computer (June of 2012). I have not had a problem with thisitem yet, I take classes at a computer club and this size seems to have the least problems.Thank you for all you do."
"Me and my mom loved them they where very good and worth the buy and they put so many in a little bag soo GOOD :)"
"This product came in very quickly and in perfect condition. The laptop case and key board cover fit my Macbook pro 13 in perfectly. The sleeve to slide the laptop in also was made of good quality and will definetly come in handy. Overall very happy with this purchase."
"yay so happy we got this app is sweet to be able to play our favorite game hope others buy it too"
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Dad.  He's tall and thin and, generally, looks good in everything so, of course, he looks great in a red shirt."
"The design is great but the size seems very off! It's a shame really cause we looked forward to it arriving!"
"Wonderful book. It's really brilliant and uplifting. Defiantly an eye opener. I would for sure suggest to all my friends."
"Despite several negative reviews, the Hornady Auto Charge works as advertised.  After reading the supplied instructions, the setup was easy, calibration simple, and once the character of individual powders was observed, I was able to drop consistent charges with maybe one overcharge per 20 cases loaded.  A level and solid surface is important to reliable operation. Overall, very satisfied with the unit."
"My girlfriend and I recently started our N-Force collection, and we already have a considerable selection to choose from when we battle.  These are great fun and her little boy loves them so much too!Nerf always make great products and this is no exception.Arrived well in time for Christmas, my only gripe was that the surprise was ruined with an error in the gift wrapping that I had paid just under $6 but Amazon's customer service were GREAT, responding and refunding the gift wrap price almost immediately after I took it up with them.I've done almost all of my Christmas shopping through Amazon and have no regrets (a fair few nerf products and all the others were gift wrapped fine, so I guess this was just an anomaly)Thank you to the seller and to Amazon for great customer service."
"She loves sword art online and I knew she would love this for Christmas.  I placed the order for it at the end of November and I was disappointed that the estimate for delivery after weeks of processing was well into January of next year, but I was SO happy when I saw that it had arrived EARLY!  Much earlier than the estimate.Arrived fast and well packaged, it was definitely worth the wait!  A great Christmas!"
"Pros:*Paint doesn't come off.*Well molded.*nice varietyCons:*Some coloring is incorrect*Painting isn't perfect, but it's okay.*These are bootleg toys, the molds are stolen from official figures.*Some pieces come off easily, like Gigan's arm."
"Is not as goog as  I Believed, Does not compress too much space, It usually open by it self in the journey"
"Brackets fit great. didn't realize when I bought shifter that it would come with a variety of brackets for alot of different transmissions. I thought this was a mounting kit? I already had these same brackets with the shifter kit, so I didn't use them."
"I would recommend this to anyone wanting to use up propane from older bottle that can not be filled anymore. or have not been retrofit"
"I ordered this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e who has a hard time finding costumes. He is 6'6 and about 350 pounds and it fit him well."
"I ordered these to use to pin y place cards on a board for my seating chart at my wedding. I like that the top is a pearl. It arrived quickly and I am pleased with the product."
"I bought these to wear at my wedding. I love the blue birds. The boots are pointy but I don't think it is too much like some other people have said. I did order them a half size smaller like other people have posted. I have large calf muscles so it can be hard for me to wear certain shoes that are taller. These fit me without a problem and I was actually surprised! The boot is also comfortable compared to some of my other cowboy boots."
"I bought these along with some other wall decals off amazon. All the other ones were great but these flowers fell off my wall and eventually after weeks of messing with them I had to just take them down. A waste of money."
"I am getting married in the fall and I bought this to wear with my dress if it gets cold. It is really nicely made and fits good. I have sensitive skin so I thought it might of been itchy but it is super soft."
"I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e who has a long beard. He uses it all the time and asked me to order him more. Great product."
"We are using it for the boy scouts project training.  It's gives good clear instructions for making good lanyards and emergency equipment.  The product was delivered on time and in good shape."
"I used this vest to deer hunt this year in some pretty rough terrain I drug a 250lb whitetail buck 1/2 mile and up a 100 foot steep hill with the shoulder straps no problem it made things so easy I love it I bought 3 of them."
"A great classic that speaks to the soul. Written in a tone that has stood the test of time. I certainly would recommend this book to anyone."
"They fit great. Very comfortable. Only washed them once, no wrinkles! Love that. I usually wear dockers, but these are going to give them a run for the money."
"I am a barber instructor, so I thought it would be fun for my grandson. He loved it. Also it reminded me of the Play-Doh fuzzy pumper barber shop I had as a child."
"I am writing this review so that no one will make the same mistake that I did. I bought this poster a few weeks ago. I was very disappointed. It arrived very quickly in about 4 days, however, the quality of the poster is horrible! Nothing like the image shown! The paper it was printed on was very flimsy and cheap. The colors were so off! It looked NOTHING like the image shown!!! Their customer support is horrible! They NEVER responded any of my emails and messages. I am still waiting for a response! I was not even able to return it! It was like I simply just threw my $10 in the trash! This poster is not even worth a dollar! Horrible horrible quality and horrible customer support. I hope that no one will buy this poster and make the same mistake that I did!"
"Great fit for my quarter horse! It holds up well and the black color matches everything. I am very pleased."
"The plastic disc skips so my lines look dotted.  I borrowed a friend's rubber stylus and it didn't skip at all."
"Exactly what I was looking for...I was looking for a travel bag with the maximum amount of space allowed as a carry on, as we 'll as converting intoa backpack for easy carrying, and this fits great"
"Been playing around with Dragonvale for a couple of weeks now, and it is a lot of fun. The more I play it, the more I enjoy it"
"It is aight, ain't tryin to buy stuff on here like those coins, so I'll just get free ones any way I can"
"Baby absolutely loves it, gives me more free time while he is playing. More stylish than others I have seen and easy to fold and put away when you feel like having a toy free zone. Seems to be robust and good quality"
"This thing works awesome and you can't really beat the price. It works better than many of the toys we've spent a considerable amount more on. Buy it!"
"Very cute! rolls well, burns well.. Nothing more to really say.. Buy some! I will be ordering more in the near future. Only complaint is the shipping is kinda high for something so small."
"The stamper works great but the scraper thing is metal and I hate it. A credit card works just as good though, if not better."
"I usually go for the buzzy toys, but being a lover of glass I had to order it. Love it! So pretty!"
"Looks hot and fits awesome! I plan on buying the lime one too; but I'm not quite sure why it would be twice the price for the same exact thing only in a different color."
"I agree with whoever said the person that designed the lines needs to be fired. WTH were they thinking? Other than that I have no real complaints so far.The little signal booster thinggy made the keyboard act all screwy. Without it, it works fine."
"They are okay . . . A bunch of different colors; but it is a pain in the a$$ to try and top coat them without the edges peeling up."
"After reading reviews on many lights I finally chose this one and couldn't be happier with my choice!! It cures my Gelish polish perfectly, light bulbs are easy to put in and replace and the light has so much hand room! I was so sick of hitting my nails on my old LED light but I don't have to worry about that with this light. If you're looking for a good light to cure gel nails this one is a great choice!"
"Case is very cute! No paint chipping, no lost stones (yet)...I've only dropped my phone once with this case but so far, so good. Will definitely buy more from them in the future.One thing that I like about ECO.. It seems they actually take the time to respond to the customers who have had negative reviews. Who does that anymore? Hardly no one. Good for them.. that's refreshing to see!"
"You can't really beat 3000 stones, especially for the price. The case keeps them sorted securely and there are a bunch of different colors."
"It is a pretty color, but the blue wasn't as light or bright as I was hoping it would be."
"Very pretty color. I feel bad because I reviewd the pink by the same brand complaining it didn't cure well (I will have to go and change that review) but after having the same issue with my Gelish brand (which never does that) I think perhaps I need to replace the bulbs in my light."
"It's a cute design and does look discrete; but that's really the only good thing I have to say about it. Only one setting and it's not very buzzy at all. I didn't have high expectations anyways other than it being a cute novelty type item, which is pretty much all it's good for."
"Awesome deal! You get a ton of cute stickers with many different colors and designs all for a great price."
"I  bought this item for my best friend,  she just got a  new bike and wanted a sugar skull bell but she couldn't buy it her self and it was ALL she talked abt for weeks at work, I  bought this item and it was delivered quickly.  the way it's packed is in a  lil baggy for protection but don't throw the bag away it's also can be used as a keep sake.  this bell is so detailed I  loved it,  and so did my best friend,  she wasn't expecting it bc I never told her I bought her one, until she got it."
"I have never been a cookbook reader, but surprisingly I loved this one. Not only does it teach you to cook it teaches you how to transform your life into a healthier one. It taught me about the Standard American Diet and how it causes many diseases that people suffer from today. I loved that it taught me not only how to cook delicious meals but also how to be healthier. I was looking for a way to better myself and the foods I ate, and I can say that this book defiantly did this for me. It&amp;#8217;s perfect for beginners, easy to read and very easy to follow the directions it provides. Best cookbook I have read in a very long time"
"This case is perfect for a slim gummy case effect. It fits very well on my samsung galaxy note 2. I love the feel. Its very velvety and soft feeling  my charger fits in without any hassle. The only downfall is that the case does have a slight smell. It kinda smells like plastic or rubber. Its not really strong. At first I could smell it in the air around my phone but after having on my phone for about 6 hours I only smell it when I sniff the case  other than that this is a great product. I do recommend it."

"This is a very good moisturizer for dry cuticles in the winter.  I am very pleased with the results of using it everyday for three weeks.  It is so soothing after doing the dishes in bleach water. My cuticles look and feel much nicer.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy looking cuticles."
"This is a absolutely fabulous bag!!!! It has lots of room and lots of pockets.. I love the design and the look of it.."

"Not only do I love the stories but I love writing scripts that come to life with the click of a button! I do wish there were more scenes and clothes to pick from and that I didn't have to wait 4 hours to play a new chapter. All and all I love the app. There are so many possibilities."
"I love this lamp, very sturdy, easy to assemble. Does not run hot and its absolutely beautiful! I would highly recommend this product."
"I felt that this was a good product. I would have given a 5 star, but I think that the finish could have been a little better.  For the money you can't beat it."
"Funny, evocative, inspiring and definitely full of lessons! Don't Forget the soap is a heart-warming recollection about a Filipino family living abroad, and the genuine bond of Filipinos as a tight-knit community. This December, this is the perfect gift to give for the people we cherish!Before I began reading Don't Forget the Soap, my initial impression was, &amp;#34;Oh, this is a book by a well-connected Filipino family. Okay.&amp;#34; I was wrong. The author's family came from humble beginnings, and when I began reading, I couldn't help but smile at the stories that were told within this little gem of a book. I love how the author's family struggled from being the FOB (Fresh Off the Boat) family in a foreign country, and how they made ends meet with what little they had to begin with. This is definitely something I can relate with because my parents started out from very small beginnings as well. This is one Filipino trait that I've always admired - the ability to make ends meet and smile brightly even during the most dire of situations.I also love the stories shared by the author about her mother - truly a woman worthy of love and admiration. She always tries to share with others, no matter what little they have. And I really couldn't forget that piece of wisdom she shared about visiting her older relatives first rather than the more prominent people who wanted to meet her. Seriously, she should be a philosopher or something. She places things into perspective nicely, and I wholeheartedly believe that a lot of people should learn a thing or two from her. Hopefully, this book can help spread her lessons out into the world.While reading the book, the thing that struck a chord the most within me is this quote: &amp;#34;Most graduation keynote addresses have a common message: Do what you love and follow your passion. As inspiring as they are, I can&amp;#8217;t help but think my mother could have a counter speech that might just better serve the majority of those graduating. It would go something like this: Try to find a job where you do what you love but if it doesn&amp;#8217;t happen right away and you have bills to pay, find a job where you&amp;#8217;ll pick up skills and contacts that can be applied to passion projects on the side. You can pursue these at the same time and, who knows, one of them may ultimately lead to your dream job.&amp;#34; This quote struck a chord with me because this is what is exactly what I've been doing right now. I just didn't know it before reading Don't Forget the Soap. Sure, I want to be a lawyer, but I want to be a writer as well. I'm currently working hard to become a lawyer, but I also have book-blogging, which is something I consider as a passion-project. And as a book-blogger, I'm expanding my contacts which I can use when I finally become an author.I also loved reading about the author's Dad. He's one very wise guy, if I may say so. The part where he chose to have his daughter wear something hideous to ward off boys was something I could never forget. It's being protective and it's also brilliant! It had me grinning widely when I was reading it. haha!Personally, I think that a large part of how we turn out as individuals could be attributable to our parents. Sure, we get to decide what happens to our lives, but a large part of our personality depends on how our parents raised us when we were young, so I'd say that parents contribute largely to how we turn out to be in our adulthood. And after reading this book, I have to say that Author Marie Claire Lim Moore is very lucky to have parents like hers. I also couldn't help but be thankful for my parents because I realized how lucky I am to be blessed with such hardworking parents who made a lot of sacrifices just to provide me and my siblings with a decent life.All in all, Don't Forget the Soap is a small treasure hidden within the pages of a book. Read it, smile, and be a little richer after reading, albeit not financially. Heh. A highly recommended read for everybody."
"I received this product complimentary of influenster. I am typically an Olay fan so I was excited to get it. The cream feels so refreshing on my face before I go to bed, and when I wake up. It gets rid of my &amp;#34;sleepy&amp;#34; look. It doesn't take much at all to cover your face."
"My husband was leaking after his surgery so I purchased a pair of these to see if they work. They are brilliant. He loves them. They have returned his dignity. As far as I'm concerned all men should consider these after prostate surgery. Can't recommend highly enough. It appears they are designed in Australia and I've purchased other Australian products over the years and never had an issue. Wish I could live there :)"

"Strap is uncomfortable and the Strap ring is difficult to operate compared to other helmets I own. Strap is not very long and pulls through the ring when taking off helmet. Not impressed at all. I guess you get what you pay for."
"I LOVE THIS PHONE! HOWEVER, AFTER HAVING IT FOR 2 WEEKS IT SHUT DOWN! :( BUT, I DO WANT PPL TO KNOW I BOUGHT THIS REFURBISHED, SO DOUBT THE BRAND NEW ONES DO THIS? IT SUCKS BECAUSE I'M A SINGLE MOM OF A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED SON WHO IS ALSO A TECHY! SO I AM PRAYING THE SELLER CAN MAKE IT RIGHT. WILL BE POSTING WHAT HAPPENS ASAP! :( ANYBODY READING THIS WHO PRAYS, PLS ADD THIS TO YOUR PRAYER LIST! I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD ANOTHER PHONE AND NEED A PHONE ASAP FOR MY SON'S MEDICAL, THERAPEUTIC NEEDS. EVERYTHING ELSE I've ordered from Amazon has been AWESOME! :)"
"Good quality I really recommend! They fits perfect on the face and they really help to keep the sun out of your eyes"

"Recommend for  ,2_5  years of age and its a bad book waste of time but educational and yea boring stuff"
"When I started reading this book, I was thinking to myself that I could finally relate to a character in these types of books because Sinai is in school like me. So I appreciated that. A lot of these books have characters that are doing all types of things, but forreal, it's hard to find regular people just doing regular things.I liked how all of the people in the story had a place and everyone came together. It just reminded me of real life. Sinai is a girl that you don't like, but you do like her. You know she's wrong for what she's doing, but you can't help but wish you could get away with having any dude you wanted like that.But onto makenzey jade as a writer. This girl is not an amateur. I read the bio in the book and it says she's young which is inspiring. For her to write that great and professional for her age is cool to me because I feel like I can do something like that too. No typos, developed characters, more than I can say about some of the more popular writers I've seen on amazon.Looking forward to what comes next. Will there be a sequel? Because, I wanna know what happens to Armand"
"I enjoyed this book so much.  I felt as though I was there with the Benders in Paradise Valley.  I have so much respect for the Amish people.  We have several families here in Northern Maine, and they have gained the respect for all who know them.  Dale is an awesome author.  It is not every author who can make a book come alive as you read such as he has."
"Though this game doesn't have a great deal of difficulty I really enjoy it.  It's a nice way to unwind and have fun at the same time."
"the case looks just as described. For a 15 yr old game it looks good no complaints.  I played various parts of the game including my all time favorite scenes and it checks out great i am happy for this purchase and i plan on buying final fantasy 8 and 9 from this seller if he has them and if the other sellers i ordered them from give me a messed up game. thanks again this one is going back in the vault!"
"its cheap and its protecting my vita against bumps and scuffs hear and their and it looks tight in blue.  while it wont absor shock from a significant fall itll protect against 7 yr olds man handling it. it looses a star because you cant hit the volume and power buttons unless you have like long nails or press hard on the buttons. but its no big deal really i recommend this. oh and its easy to install!"
"I love this app. Its awesome. I go on it at least once a day. The match up is the best part, I can play with ny husband lol"
"When I just want a book to take me away when I need a reprieve Debbie's books are great.  There is goodness in the heart of all of her characters."

"Enjoy my new case it's simple but cute. I like that the back is rainbow but still see through and you can see iPhone apple"
"I don't recommend movies, this was okay for a few hours of useless movie watching.  The acting is a bit lame."
"I love this product.  I take it with me to the lake and camping.  Considering in both situations you have limited space the size of this product is a huge plus.  The only down side is the weight, but with the two backpack style straps it makes it easy to carry."
"This product is a great economical solution for streaming video.  I have used it for Netflix, HBO GO, YouTube, and cast tabs from Chrome.  The only limitations are the age of the device.  Where it is relativley new not all streaming services support it, but I hope to see and expansion in the near furture.  Also, there is no security so anyone on the network can access your chromecast.  This makes it problematic to use on public networks."
"The item was shipped as offered, complies with the specification advertised and works very well. I plan to buy another one for a second laptop Inspiron 5150."
"Great style and color! Very very comfortable.  My son's favorite shoes so far!  His current pair is 10.5 and I tried to find him an 11.5 on Amazon without success.  When I found a pair 13XW, I ordered it right away (save it for future).We have tried other styles with straps in XW but none of them is comparable with this one. They are all XW, but not as wide as this one and the archs are not as high as this one.  Wish NB could bring this style back!!!"
"I looked at some reviews and they said the back of the shoe was loose and it was sliding off the back of their heel and I was worried about purchasing the getta pump. I bought it and when I received them in the mail I tried them on immediately! I was so worried that they would be impossible for me to wear cause I broke my foot and some heels really irritate where I broke it. I tried them on and they fit perfectly. The heel was loose when I got them but if you gently squeeze the top of the back of the shoe it will fit more appropriately to your foot. The toe area wasn't tight and was comfortable to stand or walk in  for long periods of time. What surprised me was the amount of cushion in the bottom of the shoe. It had much more than Aldo and Jessica Simpson shoes. With the cushioning, low heel, and hidden platform this shoe would be wonderful for both ""experienced"" heel wearers and beginners. The color is the actual true nude color. Its not too pink or too sand. Its also great you can dress this shoe up or wear it casually. I am so thrilled I bought this Steve madden shoe!! And the cherry on top was the low price I bought them for. The only bad thing about this shoes is if you have really wide feet I could see an issue. I wear an A in shoe width and this shoes fit perfect. I might could see the toe being a little tight if you normally get a C width. It does run true to size. But be aware sometimes your heel size is different than other shoes. I wear a 7.5 in heels but 8 in flats. And i ordered 7.5 and it fit just fine. Overall this is one of the best pair of heels I've bought!"
"I live in UAE, Abu-Dhabi, and it was such a treat to read about adventures happening next door! I have always read about some other big cities- Paris, New York, Tokyo...But now I was almost a part of an international story, having studied 4 years in Dubai, having friends there and obviously hanging out there ever so often!It is a great sneak-peak of the city's life, showing things which aren't visible for tourists or are hidden from the general society, sometimes too conservative to speak out about problems, which are the same as the rest of the world! I think this book is a great break-though for the Emirati market and an amazing chance for people to see Dubai not only as a luxurious shopping destination, where every mysterious Arab is a Sheikh, but another big city, fighting for a place in the spotlight, with its citizens having their own secrets to share!Great job Ameera! Waiting for your next book! &amp;lt;3"
"The ending is horrible. Don't waste your time reading it. The book was an ok read but the ending was a big disappointment."
"The chain seems a little light and flimsy . It was smaller than expected . The actual design is very good and designed very well ."
"Good Quality Material. The Detailing Is Amazing . Good Fit . Husband Loves It  . Would Definitely Recommend This Shirt ."
"Love this game ! Bought this one so I don't lose any pieces . Fun family game . Just be careful not to stain or fold the cards because they are somewhat flimsy ."

"I bought this frame for a gift for my MIL and she absolutely loved it! It fits the decor in her home perfectly and the pictures look awesome in it. This was one of the few three 5X7 frames I could find and I struck gold with this one!!"
"It is a good case, I just wish I could get to the menu bar at the top of my phone easier, since the case goes down low. Overall, I love it!"
"A very warm and soft blanket for layering . Not pretty but cozy and more than useful. Can easily useas top and bottom sheeting on cold nights."
"This product arrived within a week to Trinidad.Day and night vision is perfect would recommended this product to anyone best value for money"
"This item was delivered in perfect condition with fill kit. All we have to do now is take it to our local jewelry store for it to be put on a bigger necklace. And that's no problem at all as I knew I would be doing that when I ordered it. Cross design is beautiful. Great item."
"This work order is good, but I actually like the older one best of all,  just hard to find them!"
"It was cheap and easy to obtain. It arrived quickly and works perfectly. I can finally charge my camera without having to go out and buy a $30 charger from the local electronics or department store."
"These gloves are a perfect color and size.  They will keep my granddaughter warm during our Ohio winter.  I like how high up her arms they go."
"Everything about this product was accurate and it didn't end up being a fake or anything, but I just dislike the bulk that this case adds to the phone."
"I bought these for the cabinets I was making expecting them to deliver the same soft close as in the Blum drawer slide, which is very good. Problem is that the installation guide does not properly explain where to drill the holes. It says that the distance is 32mm plus the height of the mounting plate, but in their adjustable hinges if they are moved slightly inward it has the same effect as a raised plate. Secondly, even when that is taken into account, unless the door is very wide, it gets stuck on the piston and doesn't close unless it is pushed, which defeats the purpose. To properly install, I placed them 65mm away from the side of the cabinet and now thy work ok,just they are a bit quicker than the drawer slides and the doors with built in blumotion (which can be a good thing). Also, it is worthwhile to get a drilling assembly to accurately drilll the holes at 90 degrees; it can be messy if you don't."
"This game is so much fun. You get to create cool looking monsters to sing for you. Just try the game."
"The necklace itself is pretty, but the stone had fallen out when I got it and had to fix it. Otherwise, it's nice."
"Because of the intensity of the voice of the singer, cause they have large kind of beat: from pop rock to post grunge, from alternative to hard rock. Good melody, beatiful lyric."
"The book contains a lot of helpful information. Very easy to read. Contains sites that will be of great help when planning a trip to Paris."
"This beading board is ok, the lid doesnt work well, my beads easily come out of it which is irritating. The board itself is decent but I would probally buy a diffrent board in the future."
"Great alternative to the regular version. My little boy loves this one. Great price, cute game. Worth the money !"
"Cute game, you can tell its an older version but its still disney so i guess that makes up for it."
"this is one of my very favorite shows and am so sad about it being discontinued if you haavent seen it its a must watch!"
"I love Julianne she is sexy, bubbly and fun. the perfect person to work out with, if you dont know the moves she even has a tutorial thats optional before workout. would buy again."
"Nice set of fiingerpaints. They dont seem full, kind of like air in a bag of chips. But the paint is thick and good for fingerpainting"
"decent muzzle but still enough room for the dog to chew and get into stuff, wish the part where the mouth is was adjustable."
"while this movie is prettty good this particular blu ray looks like the picture on front was badly redone and badly printed. i would buy this same movie from someone else!"
"I am really out of shape and wanted a video thats got a great stretch routine, this video seemed old and i ididnt even finish it before i decided i didnt like it. I would look elsewhere."
"Great gift for my 4 year old. He loves it and learns at the same time. Its not big and clunky. No complaints."
"I love taylor swift annd while her first CD is her best one, this one didnt dissapoint. I would buy it again."

"This cologne is an excellent product. My wife loves the way I smell. It has a masculine smell that is very subtle yet definitely masculine."
"We ordered these mattresses and they were not supposed to be shipped for another 4 days!! Very happy with their early arrival as we are going camping next weekend!"
"love the smell, very unique and everyone asks what it is, no other fragrance like it around, totally original, the best ever!!!!!"
"I like this eye shadow palette because the colors are great for everyday wear. Some of the shades have a bit of shimmer while others are more matte.great product!!!!! I love the colors and the quality!!! Great seller too. So fast and nice. I recommended to all!The only downside is the brush, it's too small and hard."
"It's a really great wallet. My boyfriend loves it! It's a good idea for a gift.This was the first wallet for men that I bought and i'm really happy with the quality.What I like more about it is the fact that you can remove the ID window flap and its more than I could every ask for.Definitely will buy again!"
"Love the zebra print case fits the phone just perfect. was a bit concerned at first. I thought the cover was going to break."
"The only thing is i bought mine used and has a spot that won't shut all the way but still nice."

"This really sucks because I orderd this around september 9.... Its october 31.... Its still not here. Were is it???"
"Works well with our cabinets.  Matches our other handles and are sturdy.  Good price, will order from this manufacturer again."
"The sides of the headboard were not finished so we had to paint it black.  Needed to drill holes in the legs to bolt to bed frame. It's a little wobbly."
"Bought a couple to keep on hand.  Good price and convenient to order.  I will order again when I am almost out."
"This is just right for a singer sewing machine starter kit.  The bobbins that come with the set do not fit a brother sewing machine."
"This pack of bobbins are great to work with and are a good price.  The only problem is the shipping it takes to long."
"This is working great and I like what came in the set.  I would recommend this to any one for replacements for lost or missing parts."
"These were to be Cotton but they are Polyester, they are cardboard and not round,  so I am having problem trying to get an even stich on my sewing machine."
"They look cheaply made and I like the self-Threading needles that you thread on the side not the top.  I give them three stars."
"I ordered 4 packs of this thread as it came in cotton,  There are two different sets of colors and the both are great."
"It was such a great gift he loves it and got another one you will love this product. It look so much better in pictures"

"I love watching this show it is fun to watch and now I cab watch it were ever I go is better I love it"
"Shipping was quick and came in a timely manner with good packaging. The cables don't have a locking mechanism, but they have a snug fit and don't feel like they're going to fall out. The only issue I have is that the image shows a cable without a 90 degree connector. The assumption is that both cables are as pictured, however one of the cables had a 90 degree connector on one end. Not sure if this is intentional or somebody grabbed the wrong one off the shelf, but the second product image kinda looks like a 90 degree connector. It wasn't a big deal for me, both cables installed just fine, but it might be something to keep in mind if 90 degree connectors won't work in your application."
"This is a great product. The casing has a rubbery finish to it which makes it very nice to the touch and easy to hold onto. The iPhone itself is quite slippery so it really helps reduce the chances of dropping the phone. It also adds bulk which can be a pro or a con depending on your preferences, but because I have large hands I like having the extra bulk to hold onto while typing. Best of all it charges your phone on the go. I can go a whole day with extensive use of the mapquest navigation app and even after a whole days' use with the app (probably around 3 hrs of drive time) along with texting and calling I can come home with my iphone still at around 50% battery life. That's just insane. And on the days when I don't use my phone much I end up coming home and the case is barely at 50% meaning I could probably go another full day without a charge.Have yet to drop the phone (knock on wood) but even in the event of a drop the case looks very sturdy and capable of protecting the phone."
"I researched 10+ different iphone battery cases and this ex-era is the best no doubt. All the other similar items on ebay have lower grade cells that compose the battery pack. Lower grade as in not having the actual amperage that they say they have in them and being a low quality impure lithium product that results in much lower performance and lifespan.Also the circuitry that is built in this ex-era case is much more superior. Which ensures proper charging and discharging.This case beats the mophie (80.00 at best buy)because ex-era system comes with a dual charger, and 2 battery pack, basically triple your iphone battery life. No battery case can beat it."
"this processor is just like the other amd fx chips, it does NOT have a throttling issue! you simply see it go to 1.4ghz if your system is not running any programs, but you can make it 4.0ghz all the time, just change power settings in the bios, ie, cool n quite and the c settings, also change power settings in windows and you should no longer see the ""throttling""UPDATE. My hard drive is a slow one from 2008. it is bottle necking my system and causing my whole system to perform worse! also my video card is the GTS-250 1GB and may also be slowing things down, all else is up to date.... So when i get a faster harddrive and better video card i will update this to show just how much better this cpu is than the 1055T and fx 6100, as those were my previous AMD processors. but in my opinion if anyone has the 1055T it was what i wish I had and stuck with the whole time. but not getting the 8120 or 8150 was the smart choice i did make! the 1055T was a BEAST but the fx-6100 was the BEST overclocker, got it up to 4.7GHZ @ 6cores and 5GHZ @2 cores. the stock power of the 8350 will make you feel good if you do not have liquid cooling for overclocking. I have liquid cooling and with it you will be happy with any of these processors.stick with the 1055T if you already have itgo with the fx-6100 if you love overclocking and have liquid cooling (and you are a cheap) dont let the stock clock make you think this is better than the 1055T!!!go with the 8350 if you do not already have the 1055T BUT if you want the 8350 and have comfy money for it , get it, ifnact the best amd fx is the 8320 @150 dollars.... but this is a cost ratio, so get the best processor to suit your budget and tech wants.im not an intel guy or amd guy, i am a price guy, and the 8350 hit the spot for me and i have done research with the 3 different CPUs. compare to intel? heck no those cost too much and are not worth the quality increase that is if there is any for real world use anyway! i wish i had known all of what i do now, i would have stuck with the 1055T, and got the 8350 when the price hit around 150 dollars, other wise price per money, get the 8320. my research will save you from spending money on a cpu that does not fit your tech needs, face it, all these cpus do what you will need, but you want to be the next god among your friends with this new cpu purchase!ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW.........The only problem i had with this was it needed a fresh install of windows 7.... saw a huge increase in performance and i am working to make sure i see it the whole time i use this processor, one person somewhere said it was not any better than the 6100, fact is it sometimes performs about the same, but is capable of a lot better performance. Like i say, i just need time to figure what the settings should be. So far, the 6100 hundred cant even perform equal at a full overclock. the 8350 0n stock is a real treat in itself! and the odd thing is how you change no settings only a reboot and the performance drops to the 6100s level. I am seeing this as being the reason why intel fans hate this cpu line as it is not fluent in its highest performance.......... but in the future i am optimistic about .I dont go by benchmarks, i go by what i saw for the programs i was using and how consistent the programs ran each time i booted my computer for a use with unchanged settings.this processor is surely capable of more than what i have, as i have seen its promise even without the hotfix installed as of nowhowever if you are looking to build a cheap pc , go with the 6100, but if you want the best there will be, the 8350 is a great idea . for its cost increase it was easily worth it for me"
"I purchased this Maxboost hybrid about 2 weeks ago, after spending hours researching other alternatives. After reading multiple reviews about Mophie which indicated that many suppliers are unwittingly selling fake Mophies, as well as reviews indicating that Mophies have a tendency to break pretty easily, I went with the Maxboost. I wanted something easy to use, lightweight, and reliable. What I love about the Maxboost is that you can take the battery off and leave the shell case on your phone. This is easy to do. The shell case fits perfectly. The case is essentially flat on the front of the phone, so if you are looking for &amp;#34;bumpers&amp;#34; to help prevent damage to the glass surface, keep searching. I hate bumpers because they get dirty around the edges and make it hard to get your phone in/out of your pocket. What I love about this charger is it quickly replenishes a depleted iPhone battery. So, rather than plugging my phone into the wall, I just attach the battery and in less than an hour my phone is charged up. I don't carry mine around all the time very often, but when I do it's great because it looks nice and it fits easily in your hands. It does add a bit of weight to the phone but it's not bothersome to me at all. I have not yet synced my phone with the battery attached so I cannot attest to whether that works, but I have no reason not to think so. All the other reviews indicate syncing is not an issue. I also really like that you can buy different color cases. I will say that the red color I bought is about 3 shades lighter than it appears in the pictures - I wanted a deep, dark red and it's more light red, almost orange in color. Other than that, absolutely no complaints and I definitely recommend this product for anyone on the go, on conference calls all the time (like me) or anyone who travels a lot where you need extra battery life."
"The Bestduplicator has been exceptionally easy to use and super reliable. It has never failed me. I can't thank you enough."
"One of the best shows on TV! Never miss an episode and I'm never disappointed. Well worth watching from beginning to end"
"I bought 2 pieces and shipped it all the way to Saudi Arabia (the shipping cost a bomb) upon receiving it and setting it up, i soon discovered that I was sent 2 pieces that didnt have the backlight !!!!!!Product isnt too bad, but not getting the backlight (even though i paid for it was a total bummer!!!!!)"
"i liked this phone because of all the useful programs like excel and powerpoint for business purposes. Also, it has the game bubbles!"
"My husbsnd suffers from edema and neuropathy in lower legs from car accidents. As a personal trainer on his fit 12+ hours a day, he won't go to work split hour these socks! Thank you, amazon best deal!"
"Not all that impressed with this for the price.  The only way for the fan to run is plugged into your computer so the battery is getting twice the pull."
"We were hoping that this would make the water tolerable, but it didn't.  This would probably work fine if you don't have a LOT of iron;  we do and it just didn't remove enough.  We even had a whole house filter before it.  It was terrible for drinking and we incurred stained sinks, toilets and even laundry; therefore, we had to go back to a water softener."
"Works better than the original charger that came with the phone!!!! My phone was charged in no time after being completely drained."
"I am so happy with this purchase.  Love the color!!!  Great for the price too!  I Would recommend this cover."
"Very good love story!!!  Would recommend this book, had a hard time putting it down.  Looking into something else that she has written."
"Amazing shipping time (fast!) and supurb quality - worth every penny and more! Love it!!! Writes much better than my previous pen (Meridian Sensa)...buy it!"
"Just so nice to hear two great artists still alive and kicking. They really make each other better although they are perfect songwriters by them self."
"I ordered this because I decided to get a gym membership and get back into shape. It fits true to size and the support is incredible. My boobs didn't move an inch when I jumped around. However, I'm returning it and giving it 3 stars because the shape looked terrible on me. It was too wide and flattened my boobs in the center by pushing them out to the sides. I looked embarrassingly wide and flat. I'm very narrow and close-set, and this just didn't work for me at all."
"I bought the coral color in both small and x-small for my upcoming vacation to Mexico to help block sun exposure. It's absolutely perfect for this purpose. The color is really nice and pretty. However, when ordering keep in mind that it runs very big. I sent back the small and kept the x-small. I usually wear a S/M in ladies clothes and a M/L in juniors sized clothing."
"Since I ordered it for only $25, I'm not too concerned about the small issues with it. The cups run a size small, so I ordered a 28GG, which is one size up from what I wear in the Lucy and Marcie. It's the correct size, and it fits fairly well. However, I dislike how thick and stiff the padding is. It's similar to the Freya Deco, padding wise. It also gives a slightly more wide front profile than the Lucy or Marcie. It makes my boobs appear a bit larger than they are, which isn't something that I look for in a bra. Despite the little problems with it, it's a nice basic and will be great for spring and summer ."
"this book shows there are increadable people doing increadable things for people without regaurd for themselves. We need more people like the ones in this book in all walks of life."

"Great book, fast moving plot. maybe too many characters. 4 story lines at one time. great ending. Kat Donovan was a tough cookie"
"I guess you get what you pay for. This wasn't like a study guide at all. It was just some practice questions like 20 for each part of the test. And you they gave you a,b,c,d answers but you couldn't even try and see if you knew the question because the answer was in a different color so you didn't know if that was what you were going to pick because you already saw the answer."
"Most interesting read and theory. I have been following similar diet and it was great to compare. Reccommend to anyone who wants to stay healthy but of course talk to your doctor first."
"i love this product! I was able to see a difference on my skin right away. I recommend it 100%"

"This book contributes nothing new to advance my understanding of plastics processing, I was disappointed to see some sections shorted when a more detailed discussion could have been provided. Some topics I feel are important were skimmed over in a paragraph or so.This book would be good for a new student (less than 3 years experience) that wants an 'overview' to plastic processing."
"I read other reviews and thought that i'll get a code right away. 1 day and no email, so i have to wait to see if it will be delivered at all"
"Matt Stone has literally changed my life, not just with this book but with all of his ideas and research that Ive seen.  I hope he succeeds in getting the world to give up their ridiculous ideas about food, diet, exercise, weight loss, metabolism, etc. and start trying things that actually work."
"Some chapters could be funnier, but on the whole, this is a lol book!  Easy, quick read, a chapter at a time if you only have a minute."
"The 2600 has to be manually operated. When I first set it up, I swear it would automatically place the time in column 1 and the next box over or when the clock goes past noon, it would place the pm out date right nex to the in time. I contacted customer support and ther person helping me had me reset the unit. After that evry time the an employee wants to clock in and out it all has to be done manually. If you pay a little more money and get the next model up, you will be happier I think. By the way, I called back to customer service tech help several times and anyone helping me after the first person didn't seem to know anything about the 2600."
"I love this pot to make tea in.  It does not drip, which is why I bought it in the first place.  This new one is a replacement. It's great!!"

"This album is mix of all 70 s heavyweight rock and roll in 2008. Its pure Sabbath riffs and Zeppelin feel give my speakers a work out. Sweden knows there metal and money right here. Other bands make an attempt and fail were graveyard keeps you wanting more on every track"
"When the package arrived it had been folded in the middle. The plastic screens had been damged. 2 of the screens were junk one survived. For a 1.89 its hard to complain. the price was right the shipping from overseas deemed to much for the little plastic contents inside"
"All you need is 1 9V battery and it finds the coolest things anywhere. We took it to the beach and found items worth cashing in. Rocks, Silver, or Gold even on our trips to the Mauntains. You won't regret buying one."
"Downloaded the improved DMPlus app. Complete shambles. Now been 3 hours and still struggling to make sense of it. Want my sub back!! NO STARS IF I HAD AN OPTION!"

"Battery is not holding it charge my laptop keeps telling me consider replacing battery I trying to return it thanks for nothing"
"I saw that my buddy had this boost case for his phone and thought it was nice. After asking him about the charging times and how it works I was sold. I use my phone quite a bit to remotely enter in data to complete my service calls when in the field. This case keeps my phones battery % untouched &amp; remaining @100% the majority of the day. (Again I use my phone A LOT)Buy it, DO IT"

"Purchased for myself and it is just what I needed.  My other case fell apart ( purchased at Verizon) and was only 6 months old.  This new case is working great and I think will last."
"My absolutely favorite go to pens! Used them for years and will continue to do so! They always write smoothly and precise. If you're looking for the perfect pen to use at work or school, definitely give the G2 a shot!"

"I rock out to this all the time! I may be a dinosaur but I still love having the actual CD in my hands. I like the process of downloading it and uploading it and then I can still take it with me in the car- without having to upload my iPod. There are a few songs that I don't love but nothing that I can't stand, I'm happy! And the other songs I LOVE!!! Thank you!"
"I can honestly say I held off reading this book because I just didn't want the story to end. S.C. Stephens did not disappoint - this book was just as captivating, emotional and pulse racing as the first two!!"
"This was  great way to end the series. Finished everything up but let some space just in case another one gets written."
"I will admit I had trouble getting through this one because  of how strongly I was pulled into the storyline. There is heartache and happiness and sadness and moments of OMG...and that's just in the first few chapters!"
"All 3 books in one it even better..didnt have to wait - just read right through. It moves fast, but doesnt lack the emotional ups and downs and connection to the characters!!!"

"My son loves it, great quality and comfort for the child. Great product and great for the  price it has."

"They're great.  Working fine.  Kids have been using since xmas &amp; haven't had any problems.  Don't expect to have any."

"This book is a great eye opener for small to mid- size business owners. The marketing and SEO tips are very up to date and accurate. This information is vital to running a successful business. I learned more about marketing and how to make your page simulated for the customers you want to reel in. Also the process of ""Big Fish Results"" helps me understand how I can ""reel in the catch"" instead of just trying an idea and hoping it will work. With this information I've managed to set up better marketing tools that actually work!!!Great work! What a book!"

"I just received a set of Japanese Hiragana and Katakana flash cards by Glen McCabe as recently revised by Professor Emiko Konomi.  I am really impressed, both by the low price and by the overall quality and value of the set.  The real usefulness of a set like this is in the way it can facilitate the speed and accuracy of character recognition.  I'm looking forward to using it this way.  The cards are plastic coated, so they won't get ""funky"" like the ones I made for myself some time ago.  Each card has a series of words written in kana, which aids in the reading of whole words.  One of the most important features involves a high quality CD that comes with the cards.  Using the CD in conjunction with the cards allows the learner to completely avoid using roomaji, and go directly from the Japanese character to the correct Japanese pronunciation.  The 200 cards include the so-called ""twisted sounds"" as well as the ""voiced"" sounds.  There are also wall charts of the characters, which, sad to say, I still find necessary on occasion.  For the beginner, such charts would be of great value.  I am currently teaching ""Scientific Communication in English"" at the Tokorozawa Campus of Waseda University.  I am a colleague of Konomi-sensei at Portland State University and have also been a student in a Japanese class in which she was the instructor.  She is truly a master teacher, and has used her considerable skills to produce a valuable and useful aid in the flash card set."

"This item didn't meet my expectations at all. I really expected more! It's difficult to put in your ear, it infected my tragus piercing, it's super tiny, and it doesn't ever look like a heart ! Regret buying it and would've loved a refund."
"When I started reading this book, I got so into it,  that I needed more to read. The more I read into the story and how the character came to be, it just made it more interesting. Can wait to read on and see what happens to the rest of the main characters. Must read..."
"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was so real of what goes on now a days and the reality of life when you choose to go down the wrong path only to realize you can do right if you want it or not. I hope there is another part to this story because it seems like there could be a second book. Again really enjoyed the book and I would recommend this book to others if they like romance, hardship, and just a dose of real life crap that happends in the world."
"Gotta start from book 1 to really enjoy the series of this book. Really strong females and males but I think the females rock in the series while the males are hot."
"perfect looks great on bracelet, was part of a sweet 15 giftplan to oorder more as future party favors"
"can weigh up to 1000 grams which is more then enough. calibrated correctly, shipped quickly, all around good scale, similar scales in store could be 60$ or more"
"This is a very good description of a slow and steady capital growth strategy using options.  The book is clear and concise and does not require much additional information to implement aside from a good basic understanding of how options work.  I recommend it."
"Great Read helping understand the true history of the Mormons. Factual with many footnotes on where the information was derived. Loved it!"
"Great product, worked perfectly. I didn't know how to use the ""splicers"" that it came with, but I was able to use a different type that I have. Took 20 minutes to install."
"First off, it shipped very quickly. The box was a little dented, but the bottle itself was perfect so I didn't really care. I quickly went to put it on. My nails look like diamonds now. It goes on perfectly, but everyone needs to remember/ realize that you dab glitter nail polish on for a first coat, then paint on a second coat. It makes for very uniform nails. I'm really satisfied with this purchase, and I'm actually relieved so see the comments that it chips off easily because I'm horrified at how difficult it is to remove glitter nail polish. Anyways, I would recommend this polish to anyone. It's fantastic."
"i would say buy this for most outdoorsman use. Good camp tool or trail use. I as most will put a sharper edge on it."
"good purchase, this knife used with lansky system is razor sharp. would reccommend for most outdoors uses. have not put it through the paces yet."
"The story plot and special effects along with a really hip cast makes this a series I don't want to miss."
"This  book has opened my eyes to how God wants me to live my life now. I wish I would have used the notes so I could go back and review the things that I need to remember when my life goes in the wrong way and I need to refocus on the scriptures. My sister-in-law told me about Joel Osteen  and how it made her understand things about the Lord and God and how we need to act and understand why things happen. This book has opened my eyes on how to live my best life now."
"THEY DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM. IT IS THE HIGHEST PRICE. THE RESPECT SHOWN BY KEVIN BACON IS NATURAL.EXCELLENT.MAXIMO GARCIA"
"This bible met our expectations. We are very pleased. My husband put it under the water In our sink and it is still in perfect condition."
"It's not authentic carger. Should not this purchase. I got fake charger.BAD BUY, I would like to return. It's not authentic carger."
"The big barker bed is amazing! You can tell as you open the packaging that the seller really cares about the product. Right out of the box, you can see the quality that goes into the product. I own a 105lb pitbull and he didn't even sag into the mattress!! I bought the large and it was perfect for him. Do not be fooled by cheap knockoffs, this is the Rolls Royce of dog beds!! My dog sleeps on a better bed than me now!!!"
"As a recovering person myself who is also interested in triathlon, sports and general well being it was very comforting and motivational for me. Loved it."
"Im a big fan of the play and loved the book.Defenetly recomend it to anyone.perfect conditions. im from Argentina"
"Cute Case!  I was concerned that the beads would start falling off right away - not so.  Have had the case for a few months and everything is still intact. Note - takes a few weeks to ship."
"I love this series of books. It keeps my attention all the way through the books and makes me want to read more. I can't wait for the next books."
"I didn't know if I would like the game or not.tried it and I have to say I'm pretty impressed with the app. S1 Alfheim: 17nua3g5"
"The item was a lot different than the picture on amazon. The picture showed blues and greens and a little purple. The bag that I got had lots of red patterns and there was no leaf patterns on it that was in the picture either. The price is to high especially since the picture is not even accurate."
"I love it it works amazing and it is very durable. it does exactly what it says. I like that it takes the same charger as my iphone 5c"
"I had to be very carefull installing it but every thing went well I am very happy with the product. and give this one thumbs up."
"Once key board is set it should stay there, Hands free speaker is  not Loud enough but still a great phone"
"works good.  I helped my daughters older dryer get back to its original operating temperature.  Would buy again if needed."
"I bought three of these for all of our vehicles.  One does not like staying mounted.  Other two work great.  Just a little quality control issues."
"I have another one that has a metal or die cast housing.  This one appears to be made only from plastic.  I do not care for it."
"works great. distributes weight nicely. I hardly notice the difference on my duty belt.  A little tight at first but it will break in."
"I got these a couple weeks ago.  They can be scratched easily.  They also do not repell dirt and dusti as well as I read. Ok but a little priced to high for what you get."
"Nancy Grisham encourages the reader to TRUST GOD in ALL of LIFE.  She reminds the reader of who God is and His faithfulness while encouraging us to trust Him with everything.  This is a book that needs to be revisited.  (You can't just read it once.)  It is filled with scripture.  It is practical and personal.  It is inspiring and encouraging.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be encouraged to trust the Lord with reckless abandon!"
"I have read almost all of Murakami's books and this was the worst by far. Lazy, witless, like he was in a hurry to finish. Thumbs down."
"The book was in great condition when I received it.  I couldn't even tell it was used; it looked brand new."
"Loved this one,think its my favourite,the Scottish attitude mixed with the proper English !Loved her spunk brought the story to life."
"I have been reading this author for many years and I believe I liked this book the best of all.  The author has a unique way of giving you the ability to see and feel what is going on.  Edward Beale was a very interesting man and the author brings his story to life.  If you love history and the old west, you will love the facts and descriptions of how it really was when Mr. Beale came out west.  I would whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone who loves feeling like you are actually there with Mr. Beale."
"I enjoyed the mesh of two different strong minded people who work  personal difference with humor and solve a mystery at the same time.  This  is very well constructed and the story takes many turns and twists and holds your attention all the way through. I highly recommend this book."
"I got this for my husband but you'll catch me wearing it more often than not; is so comfortable!"
"Works great, does as promised."
"I got 2 of these, one each for my husband and his father. They both love the wallets."
"Just a bad set of stories. Not very creative at all. But it's free (you get what you pay for) so I give it couple stars for price."
"We love these. Sheets so much we just ordered another set in a different color. They are super soft and comfortable!"
"Blew off in 1 week. Did not get decent light out of this. Threw away a lampshade to expose the bulb and now i have one that doesnt work. Too pricey for the quality."
"I had a complicated set up for my screen. I needed a clamp that can stay perpedicular to each other so i can suspend a screen. It sure did. the slit on the top allows you to suspend the screen at different positions. it comes with all the screws etc so dont need to buy any additional hardware if your set up is simple."
"The mount is good if you account for the play early on. There is a play between the wall bracket extensible rod. I attached the projector to the mount and turned it on to find the best spot to drill a hole on the wall respective to my screen. After drilling the hole and mounting this whole thing i found there is a play as soon as i suspend. Luckily i was able to adjust the screen a bit and a few things on my projector. The circular disc from this three prongs hold the projector is adjustable but the play was beyond belief and even with the provided adjustment it wasnt able to perfectly align. if  you extend the rod the play increases or rather worsens. I would spend a little extra and get a better one."
"This is a page turner. Keeps you wanting more. Love the characters and the twists and the vividness. If you like a good murder read from an outsiders perspective I highly recommend."
"This tiny radio works surprisingly good for size.  Using in garage - signals great through walls and once installed, never have to mess with settings.  Very stable."
"Would and will buy again! Very satisfied with the two sets I purchased. Wash, dry ands ready to go, very easy care!"
"I purchased this case as it was one of the few cases I could find that was both matte and red.  The case is very slim and adds barely any thickness to the device.  I keep an extra battery in my wallet and am often swapping out the battery once it dies.  After about a dozen times or so I noticed a small crack coming from the top-right corner of the case.  The case is a very tight fit that requires a bit of force to remove from the phone.  However, not everyone has multiple batteries for their S4.  For those of you who don't change the battery, this case is just fine."
"These are fascinating, multi-dimensional novels that can be interpreted in endless ways.  They are fast moving and keep you guessing about where they are going and what it all means.  Just like real life, the devil is in the trivial details, intentional and unintentional misunderstandings abound, and the irony builds and builds.Many comparisons with the masterpieces are possible (Don Quixote, Candide, Madame Bovary, The Awakening, Bleak House, Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde).  At the risk of destroying something beautiful, over-simplifying, and generalizing something that is unique, one could say these books capture the decline in morals, family, business, legal, and social relationships in the United States and document an accelerated trend toward fragmentation, alienation, stagnation, and decay.Maybe it's because we were bombarded with political advertisements for months on end and our country seems engaged in one crisis after the next, but I found myself thinking that these novels are an extended metaphor for how our political and social life has disintegrated over the last few decades.Something happened that caused serious distrust and a change in values.  It is hard to say what it was (the Vietnam War, Watergate, women's lib, birth control, Bill Clinton's Presidency, etc.), but it happened, and there is no going back.  The change manifested very quickly, so quickly that one must surmise that it was something that resulted from strong forces that had built up over a long period of time.The Republicans have values which are tradition-based and logic-bound.  The Democrats' values tend towards the emotional and they seem to relish challenging traditional beliefs and practices.  However, both parties are afraid of bringing their conflict out into the open and waging an honest and public war for fear of alienating the voters (kids in the case of this story).The Republicans do not understand the full extent to which their values are fundamentally in conflict with the Democrats.  Since the Republicans want to preserve the most basic traditional value of civility (bi-partisanship), they are routinely manipulated and co-opted into various agreements.  And of course, each of these agreements and attempts to compromise ultimately exacerbate every problem, rather than solving anything.In the process of their long-simmering conflict, the Country's infrastructure and viability have decayed (housing, education, economy, governance, law) and the U.S. has split into two rival camps.  The Democrats and the Republicans have such different values, taste and preferences and they distrust each other so much that they can no longer talk to each other in any meaningful way.  Periodically, they go to the court or to vote, but neither side respects the judgment that is rendered, and both sides skulk off feeling victimized.  They live in separate houses in the same town but never talk to each other, except when they have no choice, and even then it is to conduct or conclude some transaction.Considering that I am recommending these novels to my friends and family, I am disappointed that my description sounds so dull and humorless.  Enjoy them."
"GAME keeps crashing on my Kindle Fire since the holiday update. PLEASE FIX!!!  Love the game otherwise. Very addictivePLEASE FIX!!!"
"Well crafted read!  Intregueing plot elements written with a few twists and turns that keeps the reader involved right to the end."
"This product overall is a good purchase, but like all things have pros and cons.The first thing I noticed when I received the used Galaxy Player I bought was that it was 100% out of battery. This was easily fixable when I plugged in the charge to recharge it but it was a little disappointing. When I turned it on later it worked well and started to explore. I was happy at the empty music library, fresh cleared screens ready for apps to be downloaded, and storage galore! However, all of the last user's personal pictures and videos were still on the device. For the sake of their privacy I deleted everything as soon as I could. Other than that, I can say that I am very content with the Samsung 4-Inch Galaxy Player! My weeks of researching a good media player paid off.Pros and Cons:Pro:- A camera on the front and back- Plenty of room for music and downloads- Access to many free apps- Easily fits in pockets or bags- You can plug in headphones to listen to music individually or use the speakers on the back of the Galaxy Player to share with others-  As I've heard previously stated, it's like a smart phone without the phoneCons:- The screen occasionally dims on its own even when being actively used- Sometimes the music is choppy when there are other applications open at the same time- The background of my screen has blacked out once and I had to re-start the Galaxy Player to reset itHonestly, I would like to say that the positive outweighs the bad. I bought a used one so perhaps someone who bought theirs new would have a little better luck. Overall, this is worth its bargain and I would recommend it to someone looking for a new media player."
"The best book out there to help you get closer to God and save your marriage. There is hope and restoration. God does the impossible, even when you have given up."
"I love this album sents it came out!!! This is childhood music to me lol system of a down is the best!!!!!"
"I have been wearing Chaco's for 13 years now.  I was pretty bummed when my 10 year old flips finally gave in.  These fit well and look great.  Hopefully they will last as long!"
"This is a refreshing resource for caring pet owners to provide a nutritionally complete delicious meal for their dogs.  Eduardo Mark has kept to the standards held by AAFCO; the organization that oversees the testing of prescription and high quality commercial dog foods on the market.  Helpful descriptions of ingredient choices and detailed preparation tips make this an excellent choice.  My dogs love the chicken and turkey recipe with sweet potatoes and apples...Catherine Moore DVM"
"This book was great. It had me holding my breathe and not wanted to walk away waiting to see what was going to happen. Can't wait for the next book to come out!"
"I really enjoy reading these books! Great story than that keeps you hooked and wanting more. Drives me insane that they end in cliffhangers! However, you then can't wait to read the next book!"
"I never been so moved before, the more I read books from Konstantinos, the more developed my magical abilities become... Yes I know you cannot read a book and turn into Aliester Crowley over night, but by performing the rites and techniques you literally see and feel progress, these rites worked for me, and if it worked for me it will for those of you who desire magical development. I was a beginner before I read his previous book Nocturnal Witchcraft, I was also more interested in the left hand path, but once I read the book before I was even halfway done, I was already reaching spiritual and magical goals that I have been waiting years for... I'm am now a dedicated nocturnal witch training for my initiation (a year and a day) and this book gets more and more intense as well as my spiritual, and magical growth... Do not listen to any one who bad mouths this book or author, magic isn't for everyone, and people who have been in the occult for a while might be use to a different tradition, and might not be ready for nocturnal witchcraft... it is true, this book is a powerful book, and  will bring any beginner seeking more power up a notch... Take my word for it..."
"Look I read this book, I even have it in my personal library... Yes there is a lot of information in this book, but this author is common for cramming important information in a 2 or 3 page chapter. It is poorly explained without nearly enough detail. Not only that this author is from Australia, and the rites and rituals in this book are explained with a different setting of elemental invokations. In the Northern hemisphere it's (East: Air, South: Fire, West: Water, North: Earth) while in the book it's different, and the rituals are so poorly explained I can't see any beginner having an understanding... There's a 2 page chapter on astral projection that is just ridiculous, she gives 1 technique explained in 3 sentences. How would any author expect a reader to understand, or even have success with a book written so poorly? She admits herself that her book of shadows is kept secret, and that is probably a good thing...Beginners this is not a good book to add to your collection. Try "" Nocturnal Witchcraft, and Gothic Grimoire, by Konstantinos"" ""Grimoire for the Green Witch,  by Anne Moura"" these books will boost your spiritual and magical growth, and is packed with so much more information that is explained with much detail, and is easily absorbed and put to use. Don't waist your money on books that won't be grasped..."
"i like it because it look just like the picture and it arrive perfectly on the correct date and time too."
"The item in the box was as specified on amazon but I did not like it. Its gooseneck is too hard to operate. Its so hard that the clip which is holding the gooseneck slips if you try to adjust the gooseneck..It doesn't have to be so hard as its just going to hold a cellphone.Disappointed. :("
"this game is awesome, i remember playing it as a little kid and all the fun i had. It's not overly long but it's not too short."
"All three of these games individually are definitely worth their $60, so when put together in a convenient bundle at a thrifty price, the Mass Effect Trilogy is simply a great buy."
"Works just like they say! I was actually really surprised on how well they work. There is no possible way to tell they are different than normal sunglasses besides they're not that stylish. Satisfied!"
"I used this filter for my 1998 Kawasaki Ninja, works great and it is nice that it comes with a seal. Very Satisfied!"
"The product looks pretty good, looks like bacon. However when you put it in your mouth it feels like I am putting a plastic toy in my mouth. It isn't necessarily a bad taste, but neither is it a good taste."
"Whenever plugged in, the converter either makes a repeating thumping noise in the audio, or a high pitched tone. I find it unbearable, that is why I give a 1 star."
"I got this watch box obviously because it was cheaper, and it still had great reviews!Pros:-Sturdy-Fits my 47mm watch-Very nice lookingCons:-It looks really nice, the top is not glass like it says but it is a nice plastic that looks like glass.-My box did not come with a lock and key, which I did not expect, but I really wasn't going to use it anyways."
"Great"
"I bought this for my new iphone, which was working perfectly fine. once i put this on my phone, all of a sudden i had no service anywhere i went.  I talked to my friend, who is a technology guru, and he told me it was because of the metal on the phone interfering with the radio on the phone. as soon as i took the case off, i had service everywhere again. DONT BUY THIS. although it look pretty cool."
"This was a ridiculous Item it doesn't work right you can not sew with these things.I have to return these items and I want my money back."
"what can i say.....its a filter. kind of hard to screw that one up! It works great and fit my fridge perfectly!"
"got this for a Christmas gift, and he loved it! Great quality, heavy duty, and amazing colors! expensive, but i think i got what i paid for!"
"I don't see it on me kindly I need help now NOW now NOW now NOW now NOW now NOW now NOW NOW now NOW NOW now NOW now NOW now now NOW now NOW NOW now NOW now NOW now NOW NOW now NOW NOW"
"This game is a developing BETA preparing for final launch very soon. But that does not affect the quality!Pros:No Super Computer Needed: I play this game on an I3 with 2g Ram. The settings i have are set to Low, there is an ULTRA low.Bring a friend, this game is pure co-opThis game has a never ending war between hundreds of players at once, in land, air, armor, and mechanical beings on maps that are legitimately 250+ square miles across.There is no pressure to buy, you can obtain many things relatively quick.Amazing community: Concerned players, and teamwork. The players i have played with will often heal me, repair me, revive me, work with me, give me ammo, wait for me to get in vehicles, and have taught me tips and tricks with respect. They realize that assisting your comrade is better for you both in the long run, you want as many experienced and alive players with you when the big battles ensue.Men and Women come together in respect: TRUE respect, be you woman or man, the players (at least on Mathersson server) have treated me and mine with respect, just because she is a girl nobody has changed the way they treat her drastically, only for the better.NO WHINING LITTLE CHILDREN: You read that right, i have yet to run into a child in the game who whines or acts like the console community children. Even the kiddies who play the game know that respect is key to win.CONS:Crashes, a few bugs, and weapon ""nerfing"". In Beta stage the game crashes at least once a day, which up to now has not caused any damage to my account other than the vehicle i was in dissapearing. Bugs are present in more than one place. Weapons for many factions have been altered to attempt to balance the game but there is still a big margain to balance.Go big or go home: Planetside 2 can be played casually but the biggest battles last 2+ hours.Need a Fast Internet connection: At least 1 mbps.Game requires patience: Not for the 360 quick scope... the battles are such large scales they take time and strategy to accomplish. If you do not stick with your comrades you will get nowhere."
"This game is free to download from the site, save 15$ and downloaded free just google planetside 2! Take Care"
"REALLY HELPS TO GET DOWN CONSUME, MY CAR 38 KM PER GALON WITH THIS GOES IN 48 KM PER GALON"
"I just received the item today but the plug it is Type A useless to be use in my country then i went to hardware store to find the converter and the worst part is the pump is not working i am so unhappy.."
"I bought this for my husbands birthday and he loves it. Great quality product! Will definelty continue buying this product!"
"These were so comfy! I had finally ordered these when I was 32 weeks pregnant, I regret not ordering them sooner."
"Beautiful and great quality Bassinet! I would have chosen 5 stars, but it was not the easiest thing to put together. I would definetly recommend this product!"
"Out of all burp cloths that I bought, these were definitely my favorite. They are soft and durable even after many washes."
"I love thisproduct! It is so stylish and pretty! The material is not thick at all... So it can be used for winter an spring!"
"The price is too good.my daughter very very liked.I'm very happy.my daughter birthday gift.thanks very much."

"Very satisfiedso Beautiful..very warm.I'm Generally very satisfied.^^MY Daughter 1birthday present.(gift)The price is too good"
"Since I bought this for a Halloween costume, I didn't have any great expectations. It looked synthetic and some of the hair had gotten twisted in the bag so that it ended in a flip rather than turned under. The snood was obviously cheap and didn't want to stay on the wig without a couple of large bobby pins (not a problem). I was able to make it look more respectable (for me, an 'older Cleopatra') by shaking it in a bag with baby powder. That dulled the plastic look and gave it a bit of gray. I would never have purchased this were I looking for a human-hair looking wig, but for what I wanted it for, it worked."
"Set up was very easy, but the instructions didn't mention that there is a tiny switch that controls the fountain. When I first set it up I thought it wasn't working because there was barely any flow from the top. Only after I rewashed all parts did I discover the tiny 3-position switch."
"Got it for a friend and they love it. It came out perfect looks just like the picture I recommend this shirt it is very good"
"The first book absolutely blew me away, and the second really shows how the characters start digging for answers. Perfect YA Dystopia."
"It is marvelous! I could never find such a bag in Europe. It is very elegant, very spacious, very good quality. I have already tested it in planes and it suits perfect for business travel. Everyone is complimenting me for it"
"My son is two years old and loves dora and diego. This game teaches him words that rhyme, inside sounds, letters, he plays for quite awhile and he's really learning as he goes further along."
"I love thus game and play it often, but it is not fair at all. It gives you way to long to answer the puzzle. It's like a minute for each player. If I can't get in soon I just press &amp;#34;give up&amp;#34; because I think it's a cheat to take so much time."
"My son plays this game all the time. He loves Umizoomi. He has all the badges and trophies for the first two levels on here, but the others will not unlock. I don't know how many times you have to replay the same two games, but now he's had it for months and is sick of it because it's just to long to wait for something else to happen."
"The component RGB YPbPr to HDMI converter v1.3 HDCP HDTV Fails to work. I got the right cords. not AV which I want to work... Nope I got green, blue, red, white, red. and oh hey guess what NO SIGNAL. Is it me or does the RGB cord for ps3 work for ps2? If so Then Yeah Faulty Product..."
"Crystal clear led screen, accurate readings, easy to hold IMO, and has a loud beep. All which I like hahaha."
"Amazing. Laptop starts up in less than 15 secs from pushing the power button. All my apps load faster and loving the read and write speeds."
"Works. Just make sure you download the latest codes from codejunkies as it does not come preloaded with up-to-date codes."
"All around nice case. Looks good and feels good. Very nice cfm fan on the front and bright blue led was a good touch. Only bad thing was that it came with the power button damaged. No worries as that was an easy fix."
"At first did know what to do with it or how to take apart. Till i read infro on it toke it apart slide note 3 in worked like a charm. No problems with anything."
"Sooooo good and it was a great twist to the story big ups to the author I could read this again."
"This book is sooo good!! It has sooo many twist and turns and I ended up reading the whole thing in just one sitting!!!! I'm mad it had to end when things where getting juicy!! Hurry up with part 2!!"
"This was a costume for a school project. We actually used it for Amerigo Vespucci. It's small on the sizing though. Stitching on the back of the top came undone straight away and I don't think my repair will hold for many more wears as the fabric is very flimsy. But not hugely expensive and if you're not creative and need a quick and easy costume, then it's ideal!"
"These look really cute and are fairly sturdy. My 8 year old daughter was very happy with them. The Disney Princess packaging was a little off-putting as she thinks she's too old for all that!"
"Excellent earpiece and Mic! Hearing is very clear and talking through Mic is also clear no problems what so ever."
"I don't usually write reviews on books, but this one was so good I wanted to share it with everyone! It is a must read! It's a mystery/romance. My kind of book."
"These sunglasses are so dark they are impossible to wear. They have a great price, they came in one piece even if shipping took forever, but just not worth the money. I will NOT be buying them again."
"I don't usually take the time to write reviews on books, but on this one I had to make an exception. I absolutely loved this book. It was different and very interesting. I can't really find the words to describe the way I feel about this book, but this is kinda the way I felt about this book, it wasn't the best book I have ever read, but I couldn't seem to stop reading. If I had a minute at work I would be reading, and every other minute I had free I would be reading it. I would absolutely recommend this book to everybody, I don't agree with the one star ratings, yes at times the writer should have explained better, but that is why you have an imagination. It was such a good plot that I didn't mind having to use my imagination at times."
"I love my old sketchers that I paid $60 for, they are about 5 years old with daily wear. They are still wearable with no tears or anything. The only reason I had to have another pair, I wore them while I was working in a kitchen for about 7 months and they are just filthy now. I have also washed them in a machine at least a dozen times. Now I use them for running shoes. I found this pair on amazon for $39.99-at Black Friday. They are hardly worth that money. They look and feel shorter in the front, a lot of the reviews say order a half size bigger, I am now regretting not listening to the reviews. If you are buying a pair on here please consider doing that. Comparing them to my other Sketcher D'Lites they come up way short in my expectations. They are cheaper for a reason. They don't even look as pretty as the ones you look at in stores.  I will update my review in a few months, right now they are a 3 stars to me, if that."
"DO NOT BUY!!! It worked for exactly 3 days!!!!! It doesn't even get that hot. It might be cheap buy it really sucks, the light still goes on. It gets slightly warm on high about every other time I turn it on, and the rest of the time I does nothing!! I'm so disappointed!"
"I bought these pans to replace my old Faberware nonstick pans, the pans were still in great shape, but the nonstick coating was completely gone. Great pans but I will have to see how long the nonstick coating stays on there. Still perfect after three months of almost everyday use. I will update my review if anything changes."
"I would not get this book even it was free it is weird and just plain awful. I got it for free and I will no be deleting it."
"This is book 2 in the Philadelphia Series and this series is a must read!! Just love them so much! Greatest series ever, loved them , will definatly read again!!"

"Bill's book showed a lot of insight to what goes on, not only on the track but also behind the scenes. Followed him from his early days till his ""retirement"". Once again, thank you Awesome Bill From Dawsonville (and family)"

"This isfun game for all ages. I enjoy the cute accessories you can buy for the characters. I also like that it tells you if you have a qualifying word"
"This is not the first kindle book that i have purchased where the spelling errors and wrong word substituted has been dreadful.  Perhaps its just me, but I think the amount of typos in kindle books reflect the quality of the product delivered,as for the story - i have purchased book 4 - only because I like to finish a series once started.  It was a nice waste of time to read the series but i really started to be annoyed with the &amp;#34;top of the tallest mountain&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;colder than the coldest night&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;bigger than any monster ever seen before&amp;#34;.  For mine that is a cop-out on providing a meaningful description - and it is descriptions that keep the reader entertained.  The characters had potential however they never really strayed from being good, bad or hero."
"I really liked this cook book and I thinkit had some great recipes in it for females looking to lose some lbs. I love some of the fish dishes they have in here and they really came out good when cooked them. Also glad that this was not published by the loser Teresa Jew-d-chay...lol"
"Any one who uses scotch tape needs to get this dispenser since it is the only way to truly store and use the tape. The clear plastic shells they come in are so weak and always break on me so i am now avoiding that all together."
"These champion mesh are so much better than the mesh champion shorts from years ago. They are very roomy and have perfect length to them. Not too long or too baggy. The pockets are good too since they are not bulky and feel like they are making your hips look wider. They hold a good deal of stuff and nothing falls out either. I will be buying more pairs soon I'm sure with diff colors."
"These wet look leggings were a great buy and fit like a glove. They were nice and shiny and looked like real leather! I thought the waste was perfect height and it made my butt pop out real nice. Love the way these look and feel."
"At first this shirt was good but after washing a few times it lost the tightness and did not fit as well. I will be returning this shirt for a refund unfortunately."
"I love my sonic are toothbrush but these brush heads are soooo expensive. They prob make them for 50 cents in china and they are banging them out for mega profit. I bet Philips is showing some amazing financials lately....hahaha"
"I am not sure why other reviews say this is not what was pictured because I got exactly what was pictured. The skirt was nice and shiny and fit tight. It had some give to it so it allowed me to move without constricting. Quality material too so pleased with that as well."
"I got so many comments when I wore these pants because they fit my snug and looked great. They really looked like leather as everyone asked where I got them from. They were all amazed when I told them they were faux leather. The price was great and these pants were quality too."
"This doubly shirt was very form fitting and the material is super soft and pliable. I like the contour of the neck and the length of the body is longer so it does not ride up on me."
"The spider is definitely the best male toy on the market hands down! The adjustable shower suction is the best idea and makes the hands free movement a reality. It is so much easier in the shower but you also can put it on a mirror which is another great way to watch what your doing. Great quality toy and holds up to some extreme pounding I might add :)"
"The rating I gave this book suits it for me, since it had great detail throughout the book. The book was very adventurous and very interesting."
"One year ago I started looking for a new mattress in the paper, online, and in stores. After 20 plus years on the same mattress and my wife and I with back problems we decided we needed a new mattress. I checked everything on line and saw the reviews on Amerisleep. I was a little apprehensive on getting a mattress online, but with guarantee and a leap of faith, I bought it.The first night on it I knew it was a keeper. I love it, when l lay down I usually wake up in the same position with a nice nights sleep.I certainly would recommend this mattress to anyone."
"While it was written as a fictional narrative the fact that it is true makes it all the more interesting."

"It has a selection of different sounds so it doesn't get boring.  My daughter uses it to help her fall asleep and she finds it really calming and soothing."
"All my previous headsets would fall off my ears since they're soo small.  These fit nicely and are comfortable.I feel that the quality of the sound was better on previous companies that I had."
"This is a great little recipe book for soups there isn't very many but the ones that are there are all reusable"
"The quality isn't great, but that is to be expected for the price.I like it mainly for the case and all the smaller brushes it comes with for eyeshadows and lips, etc.The face brushes are not soft.I'm not a huge makeup fanatic but I could tell the quality wasn't great.Fast shipping though and as not bad considering the price!"
"I use this powder everyday and I was concerned that when I travel Ill have to take along the big container but here I found a small size powder with excellent excellent brush in a small pouch!very convenient!"
"I loved 1-10...now I need book 11. Please let me know when it will arrive. I can't wait to read more."

"I think that this is the second best tool a small business owner could have, the first being a computer."
"I'm a home remodeler I use the floor nailer often enough to be able to tell you it's good, I don't recommend it to anyone using it on a daily basis"
"This digital dash I's a ripoff stare OK but after is complete messed up. Do I do not recommended to no body."
"I use this story often to help children understand consequences of their actions; but overall just a silly and magical story for all ages to enjoy."
"good story to help kid understand more about anxiety and how to control it. I give it 4 star because it is a bit wordy that kids can lose interest halfway through the book..."
"The game is hard but awsome I finelyy got past the first hire but now I hove to play more"
"After going through FIVE Lifeproof cases (insane!), I finally tried the Catalyst + Survivor case. Overall I was happy with the case; the design, screen protector, and audio quality were excellent. BUT, there is one major flaw, the plastic that covers the camera lens completely blurs all of your photos. I have tried 2 different cases, both with the same problem. So unfortunately I cannot recommended this case to anyone who takes lots of photos with their iPhone.I hope Griffin will fix this issue, because it's a great waterproof case otherwise."
"This effort put forth by the author clearly involved her soul and I highly recommend this to anyone who feels afraid to follow their heart. This book is raw and honest to the core. It leaves no stone unturned in telling one person's journey to the other side of the world with only herself as her guide. The lessons within can be applied to any journey no matter if its Singapore or to that next job interview down the street. It teaches courage, self confidence and realization of oneself. In it is found internal struggles that all humans face when taking any kind of leap to where they want to be. It tells us how to make something out of nothing. Not everyone will succeed but we all must try. In that we will be satisfied."
"Muy bonita novela.  Triste y conmovedora. Deja una bonita ense&amp;ntilde;anza y tr gu&amp;iacute;a a apreciar lo bueno y lo bonito de la vida."
"This game is fun but the problem is that it kind of skips as you play so it is hard to get a high score."
"Just as described in the ad. My son is super pleased with it! Nice phone for a 14 yr old."
"got this for my son for xmas. didn't realize u need and external hard drive just to play the game. It was not in the description at all so he now has a game he cant play that he was dying to get. doesn't work on the xbox360 4g without the drive."
"Love this mop. Does everything it was designed to do. Steam last long time and cleans very well. Very easy to use."
"Very good same as I got before"
"Good keyboard connects to any Bluetooth device I have.  I use it for my iPad, iPhone, play station 3 and laptop and it does what I need it to do. The only thing is I have to sync with the device I want to use each time. Unless I keep it on that device all the time."
"it fits too large for a large size. It is much larger than ExOfficio L. I returned it, anyway the fabric is soft and the cut is elegant."
"Great colours, soft fabric and fits great. I like how it feels on the skin, looks perfect below a blazer."
"It doesn`t fit elegantly at least in petite ones. Love the softness and the colour. It made me look square."
"It is somewhat a bit large. I am a Medium and it is a bit large, it fits down my hip. I am 1,59m tall. The fabric is soft and fresh though. I love it"

I cried, I laughed, and it educated me. But mostly I know for sure now where my beloved dog is. This book is amazing. It has bible proof and a beautiful story that once you start to read it, you can't put it down! I give it 5 stars!! If you read this book you will have no doubts that your pet is in heaven."
"the canon camera lens cup is nice but it send me by DHL like hell the thing come to my house and i open it up the out cover of the lens cup like s****!!! and i need to give as a birthday give! if the thing....."
"5 stars, it arrived on time,the parts are original and did work perfectly on my laptop. It did not overheat, functions perfectly hope it last"
"It is the model and perfect fit. Nevertheless the battery does charge the exact amount of time the older did, this is about 2/3 hours depending on the use."
"So beyond pissed off. I bought this because it was said to be unopened with just the outer plastic ripped off. NOT TRUE! The whole thing was obviously re-shrink wrapped, the box had a piece of tape where it would have had it seeled but that was cut... a lot of the pieces had the color of it falling off the foam pieces. So aggravated and feel like I was lied too. I dont even want to put it together now!"
"the story is quite irony. however, I cannot understand some of the expression. the English is quite old caused me confuse sometime."
"Tuff to site in but once you do its great. Hopefully it will keep me from having to use my weapon. Only a fool would not respect the red dot if they break in my house."
"It was okay i expected the box to be worn, but not opened I don't know if the film was pressed or not."
"A romantic mystery that was not too bad. I am not keen on romance stories, but this one was tolerable."
"Different from what I am used to reading. Not a bad read all in all. Might try another one some day."
"Terrific book, and a very long book!  Reading it on my Kindle I didn't realize how long it was, but I was thrilled to continue reading, and reading this book.  The writing is excellent, and you will be transformed into the ever changing life of the main character.  I loved it, and continue to think about the events that occurred, considering what it all means...  The author is brilliantly gifted, and tremendously knowledgeable about life in contrasting states and circumstances.  It's a read that you will never forget!"
"I know the author and had met Jim.They are a wonderful family and 2 of the bravest people I have ever known I know just how she felt as I am caring for a husband in declining health with M.S.  and have a friend who is caring for a husband with Parkinsons.Judy Kuenzel  Avon Lake, Ohio"
"Was for a good price. Never finished it, not sure why now that I think about it. Anyway, I would consider buying this item."
"I gave Waiting to be heard a five star review because it was beautifully written and it never steered away from the heart wrenching truth Ms.Knox went through. As she aches and fights for freedom it she manages to stir that up in reader as well. I recommend this book to everyone  it's  story people of any age need to. It serves as an important piece of history."
"if you have a goofball in your life this is a perfect gift. This shirt will be tons of laughs to those around."
"THink and Grow Rich is a brilliant, easy to read book. Many of his principals have been adopted by aTOny Robbins, Steven Covey and all the current Gurus!A must for any business owner"
"I bought these for my Mom and the slippers were delivered way ahead of schedule. She was very happy with how they fit and the amount of cushion they had.  She has never owned a nice pair of house slippers before, usually cheap Walmart specials. She liked the thickness of the soles and how she can walk out to the mailbox and not feel every little pebble on the driveway. My Mom is always on her feet and she said she will never buy another cheap pair of slippers again after wearing these all day."
"This is probably the best deal on the Internet for my Samsung Galaxy S3. I paid under 3 dollars for the case. I was very reluctant at first because I was thinking no way this case is going to fit,, something has to be wrong.... Nope, it fit really snug and is very slim along with a belt clip holder.  I don't recommend it for a construction worker or some one who works out doors, but it does have a belt clip that faces the phone inward which protects it.Don't pass the deal up."
"One of my pups in particular is incredibly stubborn and hard to train. If this worked for her, it should work for any dog. I wish I had purchased this long ago and so (I'm sure) do my neighbors."
"I was hesitant when ordering the item because of a review stating the stand is not high enough. I measured mine at just over 7 feet tall. For my family's purposes this works out just fine.  The assembly was not complicated at all and I was expecting much more of a project. I received mine 3 days from the time I ordered. I must live fairly close to an Amazon fulfillment center."
"Purchased mine in December. It's May and everything is still perfect. Good item at a good price. I would recommend to others."
"tastes disgusting"
"I used to use cheap razors with only one or two blades and they done alright but I'd have to go over them more than once which always results in razor burn.This razor cartridge is great has five small blades which means gets more hair and causes a smooth shave. I've not once broke out since using this and I honestly don't think i'd ever go back.I was lucky enough to try this for free thanks to a program from Gillette."
"I bought this unit for my hunting camper and very well please with it. Had good water flow and great range for heated water.Temperature control doesn't have to be wide open to get the right temp. If  you have a hose connecter close by you can have this unit going 10 minutes, very easy to hook up"
"Unlike temple run, brave is really hard to get her to jump and side to side and I have to push hard on my tablet and really do not like that. Other than that it is okay."
"This game is really awesome and I'm.  Kind of picky person but this is really epic so yeah I recommend this game to play an d it is free so play it before it not free"
"Bought this used. An awesome country rock album, imho. I'll be buying more, other than the CD jewel case being broken this was a great deal. . Thanks Amazon!"
"okay, i hate Thomas. he is annoying and clings onto Cia like a child (not that children are terrible). i hated him even in the first book and the second he was just worse. I like Ian and think him and Cia should be together. Thomas is stupid and annoying and i hate him and he killed someone and hes evil and cia and ian should be together and thomas is a sack butt okay goodnight even though its only 5 pm. okay rant over."

"I chose this based on web information and found out this is vert good for my lumbago and back pain."

"Perfect fit. Looks really nice on. Amazing price. Great material, very comfy! I would recommend to anyone to purchase this item."
"I love this shirt. I just got it today and it was a very nice surprise because it came much faster than it was estimated, perfect fit. Great Material, soft and stretchy, didn't ride up."

"This is a great expansion. But then again, I love the whole set.. Can't wait for more.  Just wish I would spend more time playing."
"Fits my daughter's kindle fire smugly and the hard case is exactly what I was looking for. Great buy for the price."
"In the comfort of my bed, I can do almost anything. Great resolution and so far, I can't think of anything I would love except for.. dual cameras.  That would be the only thing missing. Great device."
"I am trying to read the Bible in a year and the study works very well. It easy to navigate, except when my Kindly started acting weird."
"The top is 6 and the short size 4 it looks good but the y mix the size and i Think i can't return for my money back"
"Good starter information in this book.  Gets to the basics and breaks it down for ease of understanding and preparation."
"The phone worked well initially but started giving issues after a month, After placing a call I couldnt hear anyone on the other side while they could hear everything that I spoke, I initially thought this is a problem with my telephone subscriber and not with the instrument and went from pillar to post to get this sorted but unfortunately it turned to be a instrument fault. I am outside the returns window and  need to loosen my pockets on another instrument :("
"I am a big fan of this!!  I think it is a great way for children to learn and excel in math facts."
"My son purposely entered words incorrectly and it came up with words that are not close to what he was trying to spell.  We are back to using the childrens spelling dictionary."
"Now I can sit in the back yard and read while I cook. Plus, not limited to one timer. So easy to use."
"this thing broke in a week the tubes inside shattered and the skull came off. DO NOT BUY IT, Not worth the money!"
"This book was amazing everything a teenage girl dreams of.Gunner Mathews is the perfect man.Arianna is so Damon funny with a mouth like a sailor.I would recommend this book to any love struck teenager."
"The product itself is good. The capsules are well made.  My doctor asked me to get it. This is the 2nd month that I have been taking it.  I don't see a difference in how I feel but the doctor said to give it another month."
"Like the fit, wish they came in black and other colors, perfect length tooPerfect length,wish they came in other colors such as black!! Like the material too!!"
"Just what i needed!I went to Best Buy and there was nothing like this under $300.So i find this as a great deal and plus it fits exactly as i imagined.Very easy to install too."
"I like to camp in the teens to 40s at night, this shirt is a great layer, either as a base layer or by itself, easy to clean."
"This game is O.K. starting out but after you complete all single player missions (about a week's worth of frequent play) you run out of game play. At level 50 you have completed all missions and there are no more. To build a really BIG card takes about 1 million coins, and without any world's to play the only way to get coins is the market. Even so it's fun if you like in depth card development. There is literally an infinite combination of builds.  Doesn't play so well on I-pad 1. Overall fun game, I'm still playing about 4 hours a week after 3 months. And you don't have to spend real money to build really strong cards, just a lot of time. 4 stars. And developers, please open up new worlds, or add harder difficulty to existing ones please."
"I like the &amp;#34;wake up&amp;#34; factor of this blend.  I could drink it all day long and never get tired of it."

"I received this coffee for the first time.  Has a good full flavor and peps you up! I will but on some Raggie and jam on it!"
"This is mildy enteraining. It has super short webisodes that don't really connect. Waiting for season 2 to start so i can continue the show. It's just ok. Not that great."
"It is hard for me to write a review about this product since i never got it. The company that sold it to me took my money but never sent me a sticker so now I'm out of a sticker that looked cool but i will never know. Don't trust customdecaltattooz.Update: It has been over a month and still nothing from this company."
"The wood is warped and makes the whole clock not fit right. It has to be sanded and shaped before it can be put together. Cheap balse wood and not worth the price."
"Looks nice and fits nice. Good quality. My everyday hat. Fits like a military hat so sits well on head. Good buy."
"It is nicely built and not to large. Works like any other wallet but nice picture. Might not last for long long time thou."
"I was really nervous when i first bough this product. I really though it was going to be like the rest, but i was totally wrong. This product works great. Even though I have just started I lost 5 pounds. My appetite is smaller and I definitely will be buying this product again."

"this book was a page tuner didn't expect this ending I can't wait to read about the stories to come about the Barboza brothers and the women they love. Makes us full figured women feel good knowing there are men out there who desire us"
"Love this game it is stimulates your brain makes you really notice these everyday things you see and how they are related"
"No!!!! I was very dissatisfied with the case.. When I opened the package the bow fell completely off&amp;#128547;&amp;#128547;&amp;#128547; So therefor I had to return it... I will NEVER order another one"
"Works great for the small room we wanted to move some air around,  Directions are simple, Not sure why several complain about putting it together."
"It was what I was looking for as a replacement and it worked out fine. Just a little fine tuning"
"Long story short, loved the design of this case, very nice. By the afternoon, my hand was stained pink. Just glad my device wasnt stained."

"I tried this product to see if it would help as a sexual stimulant and have had positive results..I've been taking this product for about 30 days and will continue to do so..I would recommend this product to men of the 50+ age group...."
"Penelope and Jilly enter a secret room at the library to find a kingdom made of candy.  Dragons, wizards, princesses, kings and other familiar characters interact in new and unexpected situations.  A fun read alone or read aloud story."

"I have read almost all of the kontra's menagerie series and this is by far one of my favorites. However I am a sucker for a strong dominant personality. I this case it's not the shifter."
"Product is as described and fits properly.  Just make sure you take the time to look at the size chart so you get the correct size.  There are no pockets for your hands as you might expect on a Levis denim jacket.  But for the price, the denim jacket looks good and quality seems to be decent as well.  I would recommend this if you can do without pockets for your hands.  The 2 chest pockets are real pockets however.  For this price, it's a good purchase."
"My favorite hero of all time is green arrow and i enjoyed this series so much. It was just an all around fantastic read and a great series"
"The product is amazing it is durable and very stylish, my friends that it was worth like $40 Buy this product"
"This was seriously the most perfect conclusion to the Trust Me Trilogy! It was just how I pictured it would be. I'm kind of a sucker for sweet stories like this but it wasn't all that sweet thanks to Alistair. There were plenty of times when I wanted to punch that old man in the throat. Aiden at times was so passive. I felt like he just let the insults slide one too many times. But after all that is his father and they love each other no matter what. At times I wanted to shake Jenny and make her realize that Alistair didn't have power over her. Once she got into her story with Jason I understood it all. She was out through way too much. It's a lot to handle for one person.Callie and mike made me super happy by the way! Overall this was a great conclusion to this trilogy. It's romantic yet frustrating at times. Book 1 and 2 must be read before this one. Amazing job Miss Osborn I can't wait for more to come from you!"
"a great deal for the money. and you have it all for nokia lumina. also give you a extra charger for home to."
"I always buy Diadora boots and these have lived up to the expectations. They are exactly what I wanted and more!"
"Book was fantastic, I had real trouble not reading it during work! I loved all the characters and became very emotionally invested in the storyline. So well written! 5 stars :-)"
"This case is very thin and adds no bulk to your nexus 4, it does a good job raising the sides of the case so the screen doesn't touch the floor flat.One thing I wish they would add is the top and bottom of the case. If the case covered all around the nexus that would add protection which I would definetly buyvagain if improved"

"I am glad to have purchased this item.  The screen protector is so clear I still do not believe that it's on the screen of the phone.  The is an excellent product I'm even able to effectively use my touch screen with wet fingertips."
"Excellent book, answered a question for me. Just what I was looking for at the time.  I recommend it highly."
"This little window is the greatest!  I used some silver diamond shape mesh behind it and a piece of clear plastic ( like glass) and it turned out wonderful, very decorative for consolation cards or holiday semi religious cards."
"omg I'm too mad it ended like thatI can't wait for the 3rd partThese girls are badBambi is running s***"
"I recently smelled this lovely fragrance on a lady having dinner and the scent was so pleasant I had to ask her what she was wearing she replied Heaven by Gap I had to have this fragrance. So I ordered it and I love this clean fresh smelling fragrance. I am very pleased with my purchase I will be ordering more"
"only real con i can think of would be it not having removable/replaceable metal shield things on the back where your video card is placed."
"Very good book. Enjoyed reading it and recommend  it to anyone as a good read. The Maori people were fascinating."
"Very good book.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone as a good read. I will read some more of judy Walter's books."
"This magnifier is excellent for situations in which my hands are occupied with a squirming bird wearing a band I can't quite read!! Thanks for the light, too...it really helps!Best!"
"This microwave is smaller than our previous 1100 watt and that is a plus because the inside room is still more than adequate. I don't mind that the light doesn't come on until it's cooking even though that was a negative for some purchasers. I don't think it's any louder than our other one...now I'm waiting to see if it's going to last LONGER than the old one! I certainly hope so...my very first microwave was a very large Sharp Carousel that we used for over 20 years! The second Sharp Carousel lasted only 5 years! I certainly hope the Panasonic does better than that! So far...so good!I forgot to say why the four star rating...it's because the ease of programming certain foods is not as easy as it was with our previous microwave. I am very much computer/programming literate but this one seems to be a little more unnecessarily complicated...just sayin'!!"
"Great for winter dry skin and for the hair. I have even seen some new hair growth along my hairline!"
"This book has it all - drama, comedy and an emotional roller coaster ride. Now take into consideration that all of that alone falls into one character throughout the book, and you can only imagine what transpires with everyone else involved in the story. Living The Dream follows Kurt on an escapade that he devises as the perfect plan, which backfires on him from the start. It's a non-stop, action-packed adventure that will having you wanting to turn the pages faster than you can read them. From the very first page you will understand why you love and hate Kurt at the same time, rooting for him on one page and wanting him to get his just desserts on the next, and why no matter what you think of him you will always want more of this loveable loser. If you are looking for a great action novel that will keep you guessing until the very end (I know I did), then Living The Dream is the one book that you must have in your collection..................and oh yea Tim's other books only get better (as hard as it was to top this one),"
"While it does offer a lot of information about medical genetics, the written language is overly complicated and does little to introduce medical students to new subjects."
"please forget the color you saw...! nothing like that.fortunately I ordered one size up. So no complain with toe box.heels are wonderful and love the footbed too.looks weird (11M) but guess that I'll love it more later..."
"love the way it fits as expected...feel dry. doing the job well! I can stretch, run... whatever you want. TOP!"
"I haven't had many problems with it, occasionally I catch some static. But overall it's pretty good for how cheap it is."
"Works great as expected. Of course, if they could pack a lot more power into this form factor, it would be better, especially for a S95."
"These were awesome I used them for my wedding and they looked beautiful in my center pieces. Purchase again if I had to :)"
"I brought two bottles of this product 3 weeks ago, one for myself the other for my husband.  We are not what you would consider overweight, but we both wanted to shed a few extra pounds to see a more pronounced definition from our five days a week exercise work outs.  This product really works.  I am a pre diabetic, so not only did I lose 4 pounds, it also lowered my blood sugar.  My husband lost 9 pounds, and at the age of 50 he can once again see his six pack.  I spoke to the customer service rep and she said that they are coming out with a better new and improved product, I will be looking forward to trying that product also, and I hope it works as well as this one.  I will keep a bottle in my cabinet in case the weight starts trying to creep back on.  10 pounds is the max I will allow my body to go over in weight and for a 50 year old woman, this product will help me maintain my 123 pounds for my 5""4 frame."
"The best diary of a wimpy kid book yet!! Can't wait for more books to come out!!  Jeff Kinney did a great job...REALLY FUNNY!!!!"""""
"enjoyed the entire series, a bit different to other paranormal books. the flow of one book to the other binds the series together."
"well written, involves the reader,makes you want to read the sequels.love itmy daughter enjoyed the books as well and bought them as well"
"great comedy, romance, drama. characters are enjoyable. enjoyable boxed set volume 2 is great too!! !sorry the series is finished"
"what a great series, book 5 was the best, if you like Gerry Bartlett or Minda Webber you will love this set of books"
"I have used other braces that came undone when I sit down, but not this one. The Velcro provides a strong closure and it has not failed on me once. I have had it for a few months now and wish that I had found it sooner."
"I had a really hard time getting the stickers of the screen protector once it was on the phone. Too much adhesive?"
"This travel blanket was great when the heater in my vehicle quit and the temperatures were below 20.  Made the drives to work bearable."
"The vest looks better in person than on the web. The first is nice. However, the chained button did break. easy repair."
"Not what I was expecting.The voltage is not working on it to show the V for the car.Display is very dim.I have ordered a different brand.This product is not worth the price of 15.99Disappointed with the product"
"Best phone case ever very cool and vintage absolutely love it would recommend this case to anyone plus it came with a free screen protector"
"Flawless. Accurate. Beautiful. David Fincher at his absolute best. This is visual quality beyond compare and the story is more rich than Mark Zuckerberg."
"When I got it in the box amazing but when I put it on it was not as firm as some if my other friends and the bottom thing for the charger spot keeps falling off! The front cover for the screen really touchy I actually took it off that's how bad it was and it said it was new not used! So not happy considering getting a new one!:("
"it really teaches the young ones how to run a s*** hole of a city. this game is pretty amazing"
"Very informative book.  If you want to know what is actually going on in the world today, just read this book."
"I highly recommend purchasing a pair of Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B Noise Cancelling Headphones!!!!!!!Before purchasing these Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B Noise Cancelling Headphones I compared numerous brands &amp; models. Cheaper ones were less quality, poor audio/noise cancelling and uncomfortable. Higher quality ones were over priced and compared to the ATH-ANC7B's the additional cost was unjustifiable.I just used these on flights from Newark to Roatan and loved everything about them. Top features include sound quality, comfort, noise cancelling w/ or without audio, battery life, and compact size/carrying case.Excellent value and Amazon had the lowest price to be found!"
"This pitcher is of good quality. Only flaw is, that handle gets hot when frothing milk. I would of preferred a rubber handle to protect from scalding my hand."
"7 rares and 5 uncommons. Lots of new cards but also some good old ones to play in legacy. Thanks!"
"Awesome quality at a reasonable price. I was initially concerned that I wouldn't use all 100 cases, but I may have to order more. I have been able to get my craft room organized and can find stamps that I forgot I had. I would recommend this product highly to all the rubber stampers out there."
"It is very rewarding to listen to a piece of music that is not &amp;#34;elevator music&amp;#34; and very enjoyable.  Best results:  Listen in the early part of the day.  The effect is &amp;#34;up and at em&amp;#34; with a smile."
"New age at it's best  ever day listening.  Best used for relaxation.  It would appear to be an early work."
"An idea entered into your tablet will instantly be in your Kindle, desk PC etc.  I find this to be a very handy tool.  A good example is a picture taken away from home will be on your PC ready to print."
"I have been a fan of 2002 for some time.  This rendition, in my opinion, is one of their best."
"Different stories intertwined heading the same direction.  An exciting climax.  A warm hearted conclusion.  Once started, I could not put the book down.  It has been a long time finding an author such as Mr. Scott.  I am looking forward to his next offering."
"I've always loved Kingdom Hearts when I was younger but never had the system to play it on. When i finally got a PS3 I was excited to finally play all the games I hadn't gotten to when I was younger. The great thing about this version of Kingdom Hearts is that it can be played on the new PS3 models versus the regular PS2 games that are only compatible with the first few PS3 systems. I recommend this game for anyone who has a child and wants to keep them away from those violent shooters. I'm definatly going to buy Kingdom Hearts 2 when it's remade from what I read and also Final Fantasy X/X-2 when their remake is available in December!"
"The set of Alpha Tales have fulfilled the purpose for which I bought them.  I was perhaps expecting something a little simpler in the theme of the stories for little ones to understand. Some of the themes I would think are more for around five year olds where as the children I care for are usually two or three year olds sometimes four years old. It would have been helpful to have an age recommendation on them."
"It is what it is, which is basically the guts out of a $10 walkman stuffed into a somewhat decent case with a 1/4 inch plug and two 1/8"" jacks.Literally all VOX did was tie the 1/4"" plug into the playback head circuit with a trim pot to adjust distortion and slap it into a case with their logo on it.Sounds like crap even through cheapy headphones even my Bose headphones can't redeem the sound quality. Drags the tone of my Geddy Lee signature right down into the crapper...and it's pickups are capable of driving headphones without additional amplification! I'd hate to hear how bad this thing sounds with a cheaper bass.You could get the same quality rig by buying a cassette adapter, a 1/8"" to 1/4"" plug adapter and a cheapy portable cassette player spending on the high side $20...actually no, the DIY cassette rig would sound better."
"I bought this set for the compressor.The only nuisance is it cycles a lot because it builds pressure very quickly...would be nice if cutoff and turn on pressure were adjustable to keep it from cycling so much, but for the price...On start up (especially the first time we ran it) it seems to struggle a little but it does not appear to be a major issue. It hasn't overheated even with long runs.The airbrushes are cheapy Badger clones but work well enough, as long as they are taken care of they will last for a long time. They produce nice lines, blends and fades. Three airbrushes with the compressor cost the almost as much one quality airbrush and no compressor, So it's pretty much impossible to come up with anything bad to say about them. You get what you pay for and then some. As I said above take care of them and they'll last, take the time to mix your paint and set them up right and they'll give good results. Bear in mind these are NOT a replacement for professional grade kit, but plenty good for hobby projects."
"These pads don't leak at all like the other pads do.The only draw back is the price. They do cst morebut they're well worth it!"
"I bought this product initially because I was tired of carrying my heavy jug of softener everywhere with me. It works as intended and also makes life a lot more convenient when you only have one measured out packet vs a whole heavy jug of fluid."
"Great game lug it wish there were more free games like this for kindle first gen...want a great game this is it."
"Old School at it's best.  Only Ron Isley and his brothers can keep the sound of soul so sexy. Loving it."
"This product really looked nice on the web site....when I actually received it ....Well, maybe I chose the wrong color it's too cheap looking and I thought I asked for a silver chain they gave me a gold. Wow! That made it look cheaper, maybe they're better with names?"
"I love it....but by the time I finish this game I will have paid 500.00 or more just to play. Why weren't we offered first bid on the stocks? The creators are crafty. Love the game but I will never finish.TOO MUCH MONEY!!!!!"
"It's not the best tasting in the world, but it's not that bad. You only hold it under your tongue for about 30-60 secondsn 2x a day then swallow. You can drink something afterwords. Besides, I lost 10lbs. in 2 weeks of taking it in conjunction with the rasberry ketone. So I can definitely handle the taste. I'm not sure what percentage the chlorogenic acid is in it. But however I did loose weight. And the first 2 bottles (green coffee extract and rasberry ketone) I bought cost me $70.00. So this time due to a friend I ordered here on Amazon and got both the green coffee bean and rasberry ketone and added the african mango extract for about $45.00. I'm still waiting on my order but hopefully it will come in tommorow. I've been out for about a week and I can definetly feel a difference. Also remember taking this in liquid form makes it work faster since it is absorbed immediately under the tongue. Also this product is completely natural absolutely no additives. It is from Essential Source. You can check their website on these and other products. They have other products that I will be getting in the future but I will be ordering it from Amazon (way cheaper). Hope this helps anyone wanting to try it."
"Saw one of the concerts on TV. More in tune with what I like. I still need to review more of the site but I was excited at the contents I have seen so far."
"Perfect fit, it was exactly what I ordered, my husband and his friend had a very easy time enstalling, thanks"
"When characters are so real you feel like you know them, or would like to, you become emotionally involved in their story.  You have to keep reading to see what happens to them and how their story will ultimately be resolved.  Until then, you can't let them go.  Those are prerequisites for a good read in my opinion!"
"It does everything as promised!  It's easy to clean, keeps the coffee hot, and makes just the right amount of coffee for me with a smaller footprint than a regular coffee maker.  This is so important where space is at a premium in a small kitchen, like my motor home.  Very pleased with this product!"
"These are must haves to go with your stylus.  After an overly vigorous session with Angry Birds, I damaged a tip and was glad to have a replacement.  The old one still worked for scrolling but was misshapen on one side making finer maneuvers difficult.  If you drop your stylus on concrete (like outdoor use on your patio) the mesh fabric can tear."
"I have used the NB811 shoes for years. it is now discontinued. I read the review of the new 812, and decided to change.Since I use a custom insert  in both the left and right shoe, i took a gamble that this would work. The stride is more lively then the 811, the support is as good, but my feet feel warmer( i live in Florida) when I am just sitting around. They are Not made in the U.S.A. I think once I get used to the difference that they will be fine for the live of the shoe."
"It works perfect. 100% compatible with my Dell Inspiron 1525 notebook.I'll recommend it.duration of 4 hours.great product!"
"I ordered size for 2T but the pant didnt fit at all although he is 14 months !!! I live in jordan and was very annoyed !"
"I chosed this dress because it looks very beautiful and it looks exactly like the picture love it alot and the size was perfectrecomanded it alooot"
"love it but it isnt a boot its like a socks shaped like a boot .. but its a good one with the band"
"I ordered a large, but this large is the same size as an American size extra small. Gauzy, thin fabric."
"All episodes except two were the same as season two. also it wouldn't play on My main dvd player.Played on computer and one dvd player that I don't use very much."
"This was given as a gift and I was told that it is very readable and enriching book about Churchill."
"This should be everybody's go to when trying to lose weight. If you have to kick your metabolism in to gear I swear this is the only thing out there that actually works. Dr. Ian did it with this diet plan. I actually didn't lose much weight on it because I could not follow it myself. Its actually not hard to follow but in my home I live with the pickiest eaters in the world. My hubby and kids refused to eat the dinners I made so then I couldn't follow the plan and I was not making 2 different meals at dinner , that's a waste of time. Also I had trouble eating breakfast everyday I don't have time to cook eggs and the other stuff. But I tried to stick to it as much as possible and it does work because I had tons of energy. One day when my kids are older I pull the book out an try it again. It just doesn't fit into my lifestyle right now. But if you don't have the problems I have , it will work for you."
"Love this game. If you have ever played Assassin's Creed before you know that the newer ones just keep getting better. Was delivered on time. The price was actually better than most retailers."
"Lights up the room with crazy colours. I bought it as a night light for my daughter. Has 8 different lighting options which is cool. But the lights change really fast which is kind of defeating the purpose of a night light. I thought the colour would change slower to be more soothing so it could help her fall asleep not be like a night club with flashing lights. It is very bright. Doesn't matter though she loves it and thinks its pretty. Its just a plus for me because saves me on hydro so she doesn't have her lamps on all night. It also come with batteries. Delivery arrived on time as well."
"Honestly , this product didn't live up to what I thought it was. I purchased the Aquarius Aq360-6g Gloview 6-Gallon Aquarium Kit and this fish ordainment does not glow like I thought it. Its just a blue plant"
"This package is awesome. The workouts are great you really feel the burn! If your out of shape these workout will kill until you get use to them. I was working out to the &amp;#34;Lean Legs&amp;#34; and I couldn't walk right for 4 days. Its worth it though. One thing about these DVD's, the trainer , I had a hard time not laughing at her. Maybe it just me but she wears the most hideous lip stick and its hard not to laugh at her faces she makes , so I breakdown laughing throughout the workout. But all laughing aside, you get great workouts."
"This shirt looks awesome. Love the graphics. Arrived on time and fits great. Would recommend to any one who likes graphic tees."
"I bought one and after using for two weeks the push button of the pulse fell off and I could not find it."
"it worked out so perfectly thank you so much came with everything as shown everyone looking for replacement screen here you go"
"I have a 7 month old Pomeranian and I got her this costume (small)  for Halloween this year. She actually enjoyed running around in the outfit. It fits perfect with comfort and style. Its was Hilarious watching my dog walking around as a mermaid!! SUPER CUTE !!!"
"I am never disappointed with Southern Living recipes.  This cookbook has great illustrations and directions for a avid cook or beginner.."
"Everything was shipped very fast. Loved the heat sink and fitted perfectly in my pc. Keeps my pc very cool and have nothing against it."
"It doesn't matter what name she uses, you are guaranteed an exceptional read.  The dynamic of the characters are hard to find, and she leaves you craving another peek into their world."
"As a parent I try out the apps before giving to the kids. The app quit 3times with my first picture choice so I selected another. Using a stylus and my finger the app didn't respond well. No matter what I did I couldn't do the fine detail some of the pics required. I would not recommend this app. I have already deleted it"
"I play this game to help me unwind while also working my brain.  I don't like the ads and constant pop ups"
"I have played several versions of this game and what sets this one apart from the others is that you choose how much help you need.  It starts showing you only one picture,  with other three hidden. You can get between 2 &amp;amp; 5 points per set of pictures. I really like having the pictures revealed this way."
"This is a really nice book. Haven't made any of the flowers yet but when I do I think I will combine some of the flowers to give a more realistic /3D effect. It will be fun to play with these patterns and see what I come up with. My only problem with this book was that some of the flowers looked rushed and sloppy. Thank you for the book. I love that this book  has sparked my and my daughter's imagination. The finished photo of the flowers were great, I've got other books where the photo of finished project was not included and the pattern itself wasn't clear. This book also jumps right into the patterns with the understanding that person reading the book has a basic understanding of  crochet. Most books out there start by teaching crochet. Which is nice, but most people looking for patterns are doing so because they know how to crochet and are looking for something to make."
"The makers of these games always force adds for other games and reviews down your throat. It's an interesting game but they should give player more room to play without the pushing."
"Picture on cover is what you are being taught in this book. If you are looking to learn how to crochet, this is not the book for you. Actually, I learned by watching videos on YouTube. Then I looked at books, magazines and tv shows. This book has information. It has one pattern followed by more info. It's not a bad book but title is misleading. I suggest you get this book while it's free, but use it as a guide and one of your tools to help you learn to crochet. But be aware that it won't teach you in your first steps of crochet."
"I heard her on the radio and I must of bought the wrong CD cause the songs I head are not on it. Very bummed."
"My boyfriend bought this for me as a Christmas present after seeing it on my wishlist and I adore it. The pattern is really cute and it fits my Macbook Pro 13&amp;#34; perfectly. Some people say that it's either too big/too small for their laptops but I also have a transparent case on my Macbook which makes it a tad bigger in size so it fits nice and snugly in this case. As for the smell, to me it smells like a brand new pair of shoes, which I love, so it's not bothersome at all. Even if that scent is bothersome to some, the scent does ware of. Overall, I feel very comfortable putting my laptop in the case and keeping it in an overnight bag or duffel bag. I also have some room to store my charger and a pair of head phones so it's perfect for traveling with all my computer needs."
"Great book!!Couldn't put it down once I started reading it!What a great love story! Shows you can over come a lot when you have that kind of attraction and love!"
"Great read, not my favourite Lesley Pearse but still good! Interesting plot, didnt want to put it down! Yes I would recommend it"
"First time reading something like this and it was brill, hated putting it down! Easy to follow, would definitely recommend!"
"FOR A FEW BUCKS IT DOES THE JOB AND LOOKS NICE I RECOMMENED IT FOR WORK OR A YOUNG KID"
"Works and makes noise."
"Good boots but has lug sole and holds dirt...made for boat work, I guess."
"They are comfy is why I chose them. I have no other comments to say about this pair of houseshoes."
"This show makes my wife happy. She is totally into it. Keep 'em coming so that it keeps her happy."
"My husband has been resisting his urologist's recommendation of surgery for over a year because of all the horror stories he had heard about the after effects of surgery.  His problem was a a very enlarged prostate.  The doctor said the medications were not working as each visit showed no reduction in the size of his prostate. He bought a bottle of this and used it for about 3 weeks (along with his prescribed medication) prior to his next urologist visit.  The doctor said that he no longer needs surgery.  Although, the doctor thought it probably had nothing to do with the Life Extensions, we know differently.  He ran out of it and his problems with flow, speed returned almost immediately.  (He had tried other OTC saw palmetto in the past and had no results.)  This has made my husband extremely happy because surgery is no longer in the picture."
"We bought this item for our library two years ago, and it is still a hit. This item is pretty sturdy and has held up nicely. I've finally decided that it is time to purchase another because kids seem to be fighting over it. (In a good way)."
"The left earbud broke as soon as I took it out of the package. Cheap quality. Don't recommend them at all."
"This very basic travel bag is much larger than I expected. It comes with a flat bottom insert that makes it easy for packing. Shoes can go in either of zippered sides. I put my phone charger in the front zippered compartment. I believe that it is not airline quality but for road trips it is perfect. It could be more attractive but for the price you can't beat it."
"one cover is broken when I receive it!!! why? I can't believe..I wait more than 2 months. how shall I do?"
"I am an avid maker of rubber band figures and bracelets, etc.  I came across these Rainbow Braid bands and decided to give them a try.  So many bands made by other companies did not hold up to the rigors of looming them, let alone keep from breaking or lasting very long once made.  All I can say is the Rainbow Braid bands are awesome.  I made several action figures for the neighbor children and the bands held up to all the stretching and pulling making action figures require.  I would definitely buy these again and I recommend them to everyone.  Thanks Rainbow Braids for making an awesome product."
"Wallet has the capacity to hold what I need -- various cards, paper money, coins and keys.  Its appearance is acceptable, and I like the window that shows my driver's license without having to take it out of the wallet.  However, the wallet's coin purse is not durable.  The fabric inside the leather cover has frayed, and the snap is coming loose.  I've had to use tape to hold the cover together."
"These jeans fit perfect. This is the second time I've bought them. They're the exact color that is shown and are delivered fast. I hate shopping in the store. I get what I want and I don't have to leave my house."
"worth every cent. very reasonably priced. equipment just as advertised . awesome buy."
"does not tell tool size or ring size"
"The case does it all for me. Its one of the best all around cases out there. It functions as a stand that works in every position. You read reviews about the tablets slipping out of the grooves and falling. I have never had that problem with this case. It stands up very sturdy and to a great amount of poking and pressure. It also has a great slim profile that makes it easy to take anywhere. Its an awesome case"
"Good app, love it, I like to listen to all my stations when I'm away form my home state. Thanks....."
"Was easily applied and seemed thick and works great and arrived very fast. I have dropped it since i applied it and not a scratch :)"
"It was for my husband and he loved it. Just what he was looking for. He will recommended it. &amp;#128076;"
"These are ok I guess. I bought them for P3 of the HCG Diet since there are no sugar, syrup, etc.I probably would not buy them again, but I will finish them no problem. There just really isn't much of a flavor at all."
"These bowls were a great buy! My little ones like to push my regular bowls across the floor. With these, they stay put!"
"I am the HCG Queen, so anything even remotely related to it, I am going to check it out. This was the worst dressing I have ever tasted in my life. It is pure water with ZERO taste. For almost $16 a bottle, this is A JOKE! I also ordered the other flavor; same thing. I am extremely disappointed, and prefer my OACV and Lemon Juice dressing I make myself, for a fraction of the price. I cannot believe people are saying this is good!"
"Perfect for our girl's  room.  We loved and it and so did she. Love the pre lit lights. Super cute."
"We were in this super sized candy store in NYC where the candy was a fortune. Came home and ordered it here instead. Perfect."
"I loved this book so much, such a great read, but oh my goodness I almost died because it was beyond sad. Gah, just so perfect &amp;lt;3"
"It is always good to read a wonderful story. No. Bad words no fighting. You are made to feel like your part of the family."
"great book love Joyce she does not hold back."
"Easy application, and if you screw up you can still apply w/o bubbles. The only draw back is the protector does scratch easy."
"A nice romantic story. You feel warm in the heart and  want to read more from this author. Totally recommended!"
"I'm going to be honest. My love of this game stems mainly from my nostalgia towards it. I opened up this baby on Christmas '03 and from then on it defined my childhood. Let me also be the first to say that this is NOT a genre-defining revolutionary 3-D platformer such as Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie/Tooie, the likes of which it very obviously emulates. It is, at heart, a gigantic fetch quest with only very basic gaming mechanics that anyone who's played the aforementioned games would recognize in a heart beat. All that sounds pretty underwhelming, so why do I like it so much. Well, it's not just nostalgia. The game comes with 13 huge levels to explore, all based directly off of areas from the show. The designers did a perfect job of matching the game world to what we know from the show. Every inch of this game oozes Spongebob, from the sky being decorated with flower clouds, to the absolutely amazing voice-acting. The writing in this game is off the wall hilarious! The music varies from place to place and isn't anything special, it does its job adequately, except for the boss music which is honestly some of the most epic video game tunes I've ever heard. Speaking of bosses, the three main ones are terrific and some of the best I've ever fought. The visuals are not technically the greatest but they fit the art style of the show and you immediately forget the fact that they've aged quite a bit in 9 years. The gameplay is your standard 3-D platforming fare, with added twists (like tongue-boarding) combined with the overall zaniness of each level that keeps things surprisingly interesting. The game itself is relatively easy to get through, but there are some missions that really stand out as very challenging. 100% completion will probably take about 15-20 hours on the first try, so it does have a very good length. But what stands out the most is the developers' love of the show, and it's obvious once you start playing. If you are a fan of the show, this game is a MUST-BUY! No questions asked! It is an interactive extension of the show that manages to pack every bit of joy from the cartoon into a tiny disc and actually do it right. It is NOT a sloppy licensed title by any means, and trust me, Nickelodeon has made TONS of those. This game is a joy to play and it defined my childhood. I hope you can enjoy it to!"
"I have a scion tc and I absolutely love this lanyard. It clip just right so nothing falls off the hook"
"projector was okay if its all the right spots the only thing that sucks is that the marks it leaves after you applied a screen protector to your phone. it's not clear you can still see the marks and indents of where you try to put it on"
"what this for my mother in law and it doesn't fit on right to the screen. The case wont snap on niw because the screen protector"
"Was broken when I got it. Thanks for nohing if you want a piece of crap the. This is the way to go"
"Very satisfied witht he product.. bought a couple of these for our whse, to track and a have a visual of work progress.."
"Received this on my porch on a Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised. Packaged well. I give three stars only because the 11 inches were very deceiving.  This is the smallest doll my daughter has. It's cute with its little creases and such, but I could have found something at Toys R Us for the same price, and bigger.  Not to say I won't order from them again, I will just have to get a bigger one. My daughter loves it all the same."
"I enjoyed this book, i literally couldn't put it down. However, it reminds me of a generic brand of 50 shades of grey. It is still a good book and i recommend it to anyone who liked 50 shades of grey."
"It was a good book and in was really into it but it cut off so short! I am looking forward to the next one."
"I used them to replace rear speakers in a porsche BoxsterGood fit and sound better then the OEM speakers"
"My cats love it. My cats took to it right away.  I had ordered some quite some time ago and they had worn out so they were happy to have it back."
"My daughter has thick hair and I hate the blowdrying process but with rhis product I don't mund and neither does she"
"Waste of my damm money ,my cat Boss barely looked at it much less with it,,my 16mth old granddaughter plays with.it more"
"The quality of this helmet is awesome, it is well over a $100 helmet at a $50 price. Visor doesn't fog up much or anything, fits well and is comfortable on long rides. Going to buy a tinted visor to go with it."
"This one crazy book... guess they write just about everything now a days.. but it was still very interesting.. ha"
"Pop Fizz, an alchemist in potions is powerful. Being a magic skylander, he can throw potions that have different affects. He can also drink his potion and go beserk. He is really fun to play with along with his beserker and potion paths. There is both lightcore and normal figure, he also comes in a triple pack. I hoped you liked my review. Leave any comments or questions skylanders giants. :-)"
"Drobot, the new lightcore character from the tech is not being sold a lot. Why? Well first you can't switch paths, you have to reset it. Anyways, he helps a lot whens its like four Arkeyan Defenders or Axecutioners. His attacks are pretty weak, but his soul gem makes his thrusters damage enemies. Activision really needs to think it again. You know, I thought Activision was going to take a step forward in Skylanders, but didn't. The blasters and bladegear paths don't really make a difference in the character and really I think you can expect more from the giant, Bouncer in this case. I wouldn't say that Drobot is the worst in my conclusion, but that drobot isn't like the rest of the Skylanders. Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants. :-)"
"I have love hair and with the rollers it really helped the straightener to glide down and perfectly straighten my hair. I like it.  I even use it on my daughters long hair and she doesn't complain one bit. We both would say go ahead any get it ...oh yeah and itcworks better then my other 2 pricier straighteners."
"This is an interesting story that moved along at a good pace. I enjoy young adult books that have substance, and characters that overcome physical and moral challenges. I look forward to the next book."
"Bob Goff began his short wonderful book by telling how someone reached out to him in a loving and sacrificial way when he was a teenager in need. He went on to tell of many ways he and his family have dedicated much of their lives to doing the same for others. This should be inspiration and encouragement for anyone who desires to put love into action."
"My son loves the video that comes with this app. We watch it several times a day! I also like that I have the choice to read it to him and the puzzles and many extras that come with it."
"I really got into this movie which is rare for me and the extra disc with the special features makes it that much better"
"Great idea as a gift, especially for the boss or parents, excellent quality just as expected, would recommend to anyone who uses large coolers, is considerably large, make sure to check sizes when ordering"
"it is not working  always says error . i was thinking this item will make me happy to check my blood pressure but when i try to use it says error than i was thinking may be battery is weak so i buy another battery and use same error is came , i am give up to check and check again  so i am not try again."
"Accurate, precise, and great weather alerts. Don't need to watchr listen to weather reports any more. Would like to see times and temps listed for a two or three day period instead of scrolling."
"Easy to use as well as quick and accurate, this app is great. There are no bugs and it doesn't freeze. Fast to open and close."
"Love this app. Sometimes the answer is obscure but overall it's a fun game. When you identify the bands, remember what they looked like then, not now."
"Lost one flashlight because link to the flashlight was weak. Link should be stronger. You can just pull loose the weak link."
"This product did not work at all. The product looked &amp; smelled like it was very old. The package was sealed when I received it but it looked like it had been sitting so long it started to leak. I will not purchase again."
"I am so excited about having ordered this book....got it, can't put it down! Prepare to have a life changing experience. You owe it to yourself!  Highly recommended. 5 out of 5 stars"
"I received mines this morning. I placed it on my phone and it came off. The adhesive on the glass didn't even stick to my phone at all. It was a waste of my money. If I could get a replacement I would be more than happy. Other than that It was a big disappointment. I was really looking forward to having this on my phone because I heard it is the best protector there is. Also the glass came with scratches."
"I bought this phone for my nephew and he's estatic about it. Says it's super fast and does all he wants to do as a 23yr old...."
"This skirt was very cute.  When I got it, it fit just fine and I didn't have to roll down the waist for good measure.  The material feels very smooth, and the color was a very deep black.  I would have gotten a different color, but I don't buy skirts, so I thought to get something in a more basic color.  The skirt runs a bit shorter than I thought it would, maybe more than a couple of inches above my knees.  I wouldn't wear it out unless I had some shorts underneath, but to dance or do some exercises in, this skirt would be perfect.  I'm definitely going to buy another!"
"I absolutely love this cute case!  Definitely a fan of Rilakkuma and what better way to show that than to have his mug plastered on the back of my iPod?The product itself is a very soft rubber, and it's quite durable.  Not too sure if i can say that for the ears, however, but I always take good care of it.  I use the little black pouch it came with as a screen cleaner just because.I have dropped my iPod in the couple weeks I have owned it, and not a single scratch.  Not even on the case itself.  The impact is completely absorbed in the bouncy case and it still looks amazing afterwards!  The iPod might slip out a little if you're not careful how you're moving it, but otherwise it fits perfectly.If I could get another one JUST TO HAVE I'd get this one again and all its colorful brothers and sisters.  I definitely recommend this!"
"This book is going to be a gift for Christmas! I think the Chef in the family will love it because they are avid watchers of the Downton Abby Series!! Thanks for getting it tome on time and great shape! :-)"
"Ive been diagnosed with Tarcel Tunnel (feet) and for the last 3 years Ive been wearing TEVAS! THey are the ONLY ANYTHING that works for me!!! I am usually an 8.5 but the arch fits better for me with a 9 (so I have a bit leftover at the toe~I don't mind at all)!! These were/are a GodSend for me when I found them!!!!Thank you very much TEVA~and keep'em coming!!!:-)"
"Just like you said it was......thankyou for sending it and wrapping the way you did-to help protect it too!And it was at my address and in the mailbox and ready for me to give to my husband for our 21st Anniversary!Thankyou and I will definitely look for your site to order from again!!:-)"
"this show is excellent show.Sorry to hear that there would only be 6 seasons. It will be hard to something to even come close to something like this show"
"nice bands, we had purchased a few others but these are very comfortable to wear and nice looking also. We got one for the wife and one for the husband. These are very nice rings"
"I really like this cardigan. Even though its thinner fabric than I expected its warm enough and comfortable. The litte pockets are cute and convienent."
"I just got my cover and OHMY! IT'S ADORABLE!!!!!! I LOVE IT! Everything is good although I didn't get the cloth thing but it don't matter :D MUST GET"
"This book is very well written and easy to read. It has many concepts that you can apply to your life both professionally and personally. It is full of great examples and analogies that help you get a better grasp of what is being explained.As a friend said he reads this book every couple of months to refresh what he may have forgotten and I plan to do the same."
"I'm a software developer and hoped to get some business insight into the how and why the big 4 have developed a ""platform"". The term ""platform"" seems to be used quite loosely and there is little insight, interviews or research to back up claims made throughout the book. After reading the first two chapters I did not learn anything new and the rest of the book makes a lot of generalized claims that, as someone with an IT background, makes me cringe."
"I bought this book after seeing the author's TED talk. It started off quite well however it progressively became difficult to stay focused and as the author delved in definitions and meanings. As some of the other reviews have said, there is a lot of fluff without any real substance."
"There are several reviews but this game was so awesome I wanted to give it a 5 star review. It's one of very few games that I have played with an awesome story line that I was compelled to write a review. Definitely worth buying!"
"Short series but had me interested from the very first scene. The jokes are sometimes crude but that's the kind of humor I like. Keen to see more of this show."
"LOVE this kit. Its literally just as easy to install as the youtube video. Makes your car look like a spaceship at night, especially if you have a convertible like me. The music function is more like a strobe function to me, but I dont use it anyways. Before I got the kit I wondered if you could change it to any color and pause it, and as a matter of fact you CAN! I was very happy with all of the different modes and options and is surprisingly bright. All of my friends LOVE it and want it in their cars too lol. Best $35 I've spent on my car. I think I'll get the wheel well kit next."
"I have bought other cheaper HID kits before on amazon, but I never will again. The kensun HID kit is the clearest, easy to install kit I have ever bought. They have been working for 2 months now with no flickering, or any other issues. Looks like right out of the factory.  Its worth the extra money to buy a good brand like kensun, trust me."
"I specifically ordered this firebowl because it was advertized as a 35 inch firebowl. After receiving it in the mail, the bowl only measured 22 inches. It was too late to swap it out because I was having a party that night and couldn't order another in time. That's false advertizing and it needs to be fixed immediately."
"One of the best books I've ever read.I recommend it to everyone, especially Texans! I'm from the area Herman was captured in &amp; recognized many of the place he described in the book."
"I purchased the &amp;#34;small dog&amp;#34; sized collar. They should change the description to &amp;#34;VERY small dog&amp;#34;. We have two small dogs and the collars were too small for both of them even when adjusted to the largest setting on the collar.Also, the fastener that is supposed to keep the collar on the dog is too weak. A strong flea or a dog scratching himself could pull it off without even knowing it.  - I also purchased  a large collar for our large dog and put it on him. The next day, this $60 collar is gone! It had simply fallen off somewhere because of the puny little fastener design of the collar."
"i like this case because it is flush to the screen and it does not make the phone noticeably larger"
"Our twins were born premature at 34 weeks and we have been supplementing their diet from the very beginning.We have tried pretty much every gummy vitamin on the market and I am so thankful we found the Natural Dynamix brand.The flavors are so good that my twins ask for the &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; a few times throughout the day...we even use the gummy vitamins as a reward for good behavior! The ingredients are natural and perfect for a health conscious parents with picky eaters.I will be trying the other gummy vitamins in this product for sure! Great Value and High Recommend this product!"
"I buy these item thinking is a version normal and is a version A and the performance is too bad. I read 10 meters signal but 2 meters the device fail i feel is a toy and to much."
"This item has good performance, but if you want more (Bluetooh) buy version mk808B.Wifi work good, signal HDMI has a problem with resolution too big, but update or change the firmware fix it."
"I loved this book! I recommend this book for ages 9-14 for young girls. I read other comments saying this book seemed long but actually is the shortest book in the series. i loved it and i cant wait to get the next books! :)"
"Pretty standard romantic comedy. Somewhat predictable plot. However, it's definitely not a bad movie by any means, and is good for an occasional chuckle."
"this app is awesome I love all the different dragons and it always has awesome new dragons to get every month!! if u are looking at this review GET THIS APP!! thank u for reading!!"
"The sizes definitely run a bit small. I ordered my normal size small and it fits, but it's definitely tight! I won't return it and I love the shirt! I wear it often :-) but if I ordered another, I will order the next size up."
"This is a great case. This is my 4th iPhone. I have had the whole gambit of cases. Tough armor offers great protection with a small size. I carry my phone in my front pant pocket. No hang ups and is just slightly bigger that the actual phone."
"First unit sounded like an old boat dock, dissembled a few times and even called customer service for help. love it however needed to return one."
"I love to read book about creature of night and I love werewolves itself bye knowing the fax to know how to stay away from them while the human is in there wolf form because the wolf itself is dangerous"
"Very amazing on holdings music and its pretty good for the price and its fast on shipping it go to my house less then a week"
"The Startech is a power strip and it work like a champ if you planning on starting you studio I think you should get it its really good"
"The cable is very neat and its fast on it shipping and its powerful as he'll its a amazing how clean the cord sounds sounds"
"product fails two weeks. sent for repair and fails again. would not recomend for anybody. product is no good.  ."
"I'm so glad I got this!  I'm getting ready to take my test and after getting the book and reviewing it I feel ready."
"For some reason the color on this is not true.  Mickey's face is pink as if he has a sunburn.  And it's not a computer monitor issue - the picture on the package looks like normal, but on the blanket itself, he's pink.  Have to return it, just glad I still have time before the birthday party!!The price was right, but the quality was wrong, so I would not recommend this to anyone."
"We love it!  We didn't received the extras that were promised to be in it, but we are enjoying watching the show.  We didn't recieve the postcard autographed by Jonathan Frid.  We received all the disks and the episode guide."
"this book i started reading a week ago and loved the sample its like i couldnt put the book down i stayed up till 1 am just because i was so key on finishing it. this book is amazing for tweens in my opinion"
"I LOVED this book. It takes a long time to read but it really really good so buy it. You will enjoy if you are a girly girl....;)Deanna"
"generally the design is good and convenient but the quality of the brown leather is not, as it started peeling of in less than 1 month."
"I've had this toaster oven for about 6 mos. There's just two of us to cook for, so I use it quite often. I love the convection oven. Cooks things much faster and also browns them at the same time. Great for crispy potatoes. All four functions work well and love that you can remove the bottom pan to clean it. I've read in other reviews the complaints about the outside of the oven getting hot. I've never had a toaster oven that didn't get hot on the outside. And yes, the beeper is loud, but comes in handy if you're in another part of the house while something's cooking and you want to hear it when it's done. We've used the oven 4 or 5 times a week since we got it and haven't had any problems. We're very pleased with this product."
"I found this game to be very very easy. It would have been nice for more of a challenge...like maybe more items or things partially hidden...I love hidden object games and just hoped this one would have been better."
"As always the Winchester boys are keeping me on the edge of my seat. The plot lines are spectacular and I'm officially addicted!"
"This video ""The Siege At Ruby Ridge"" is well worth viewing, it makes you think about the America we now live in, and how our government officials view our ""Constitutional Freedoms"" as Private Citizens."
"It does ""Work"" as stated, and I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the sling swivel kit needs to come with not just the long wood/plastic screw base mount, but needs to also include a shorter base mount wood/plastic screw.  I had to customize/shorten the long base screw that's used for wood/plastic stocks, so it would fit my pistol grip folding stock, but the sling kit mounts do give a strong anchor point for your sling , and they look good when installed, and it functions great with my condor brand name sling.JM"
"This Propane Adapter for refilling &amp;#34;One Pound Tanks&amp;#34; works as described, it's &amp;#34;A Must Have Item&amp;#34; if you own a Mr. Heater &amp;#34;Buddy Portable Heater&amp;#34;."
"If you're looking for a small live animal trap that works, then this is the trap for You !  But I would have liked for the trap to have been manufactured using heavier materials, but as for the function of this small trap, it works ""Great""."
"Purchased this shooting bench rest to use to bore sight my rifles, I am please with it , for the purchase price I paid it was a very good deal."
"Nice Sling, it seems to be heavy duty, and I would have given it 5 stars, but it may be to adjustable, meaning I don't know if the heavy duty plastic disconnect buckles are really a &amp;#34;Plus&amp;#34;, but again the sling does appear to be made of heavy duty materials.JM"
"For the money this belt is probably a good buy, but certainly not anything special, but it does hold the 12 ga. shotgun shells tightly, and it will fit up to a 48&amp;#34; inch waist size, so &amp;#34;It's An OK Shotgun Belt&amp;#34; that for the money that I would recommend !JM"
"This Is A Very Neat Tactical Vest, &amp;#34;A Best Buy For Sure&amp;#34;,  you will have to look very hard, and spend a lot more money to find a better vest that this one, but while the vest is great, and adjust to about a 2XL size, the belt that comes with the vest is also of good quality, but the belt's waist size fit is only about 42&amp;#34; to maybe 44&amp;#34; at max.  Again this tactical vest is a best buy, and made/sewn very well.JM"
"The &amp;#34;Charger&amp;#34; It's a little hard to figure out, but it does do a great job of charging your &amp;#34;Cell Phone Batteries, Great Deal For The Money&amp;#34; !JM"
"An interesting read. Definitely one and done for me. Leaf is the most messed up protagonist I had the pleasure of reading about, through his &amp;#34;God's Eyes&amp;#34;. So, it was comical at times, strange mostly, and to be honest, I bought this book because Satan Burger is something I would have come up with for the title. So I connected on that level. Many times it was just strange as hell and gave me weird feelings b.c it's just such a strange story. The images this book puts in your mind is pretty gross. Definitely funny and I wont ruin it for you, but personally the ending made my skin crawl and the very end was just oddly strange and left me feeling like man, I'm sorta uneasy right now. Weird, I know. Sorta left me wanting more, but it definitely ends... So, for that, this book offered an interesting experience b.c it makes you jump out of your skin. Nothing about this book is normal and based on that, I liked it."
"Well packaged and arrived on time. While not my favorite Avengers episodes, the Cathy Gale series was necessary to complete my collection. It also helps to watch the progression the series made and confirm the pivotal role Macnee made his own so elegantly."
"I think a majority of the bad reviews I read about these cartridges not fitting may have to do with the model you are fitting them into. I noticed hardly any reviews included the model #. Well, here is mine: MFC-J825DW. I have installed only one black cartridge so far. I will update review to include any subsequent pertinent info. First, the package arrived with only one damaged leaking cartridge, a red one. Next, the plastic film covering the inkjet hole is very hard to remove easily without patience and a small sharp tool. Installation was easy enough, and after just one blank page, it printed well and normally. Bottom line, for the price of just one manufacturer approved replacement cartridge, you get 10. If only 2 of the cartridges work for you, you made your money back. I think the great price is due to these few obstacles. So....&amp;#34;ya spin da wheel, an ya take ya chances&amp;#34;."
"I love love love this case, the rubber corners make for a very protected phone. The only downfall is the rubber gets a little loose sometimes and it gets hard to be able to click your buttons. Its an easy fix though. This case is awesome, definitely will be buying another in a different color"
"EVERYBODY WANTS ONE! EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT A STEELER FAN...IT'S THE PERFECT LEI FOR A LOCAL IN HAWAII NEI....."
"I got the Stitch phone case for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely LOVES it!!!! It's cute, soft and protects her phone well. I would recommend this phone case for anyone!!! AWESOME!!!!!!"
"The camo on the back is a sticker type material and started to peel off shortly after we received the phone case."
"I love these earrings.  The color as well as the emerald cut style is bold but yet delicate.  A definite fall color that can be worn year round."
"Its great but too slow like old people. If the game wasnt all lagged out I might of enjoyed it. Its hard to purchase any coins when it lagged out on me."
"They are some of the most comfortable boots that I've bought. I love them. Will tell all my family and friends."
"This thing looks great large graphic not just a sticker on a price of metal the image is clear coated over for a shinny finish. The pin is large but it symbolizes trust and companionship that will come in handy for anyone who loves the movie and will understand the significance. The seller was great it came within days of purchase the item comes with a card that says the Ellie badge the highest honor I can bestow on the front and a picture of Ellie and mr fredrickson on the back great touches and adds to the presentation of the peice overall an amazing product with a lot of meaning and was shipped very fast. Very satisfied overall"
"Well written, tells the story, and provides the markers for one involved in a similar situation as the author. Highly recommend this book to anyone who is having similar relationship problems as well as their family members."
"Excellent read! Such a feel good story. Nice to be able to read a good clean love story!! Heartwarming! :)"
"Beware. Don't make the Fujistu mistake I did. I now own $2,500 worth of Fujistu-scanner-bricks.Fujitsu sells these expensive business-class scanners, then fails to update drivers for new versions of Windows.  When this happens, your scanner hardware will work fine, but your computer won't recognize it. I guess for a few hundred bucks I could live with this, but when prices get north of $1,000, I feel cheated.Buy this machine, and you may well be shopping for a new scanner before you've depreciated the first one."

"Average. A little too unbelievable in parts. I guess that's why they call it fiction. I will read another tonight."
"I enjoyed the book and recommend it to everyone that wonders what life could be like if this country could be like at the end."
"This was a good read and left  me with plenty to think about. I enjoyed the book but felt the sadistic treatment of the orphans and future pilot was not consistent with the story.  It seemed to be a little too  extreme and unbelievable."
"Entertaining book. I enjoyed the twist and turns of the story but sometimes had a hard time keeping up with who's who. The book had so many characters in it that it made it hard to keep up with them."
"We loved the movie.  However, the sequel after the movie &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; so had to turn off.  We have not viewed all the other movies yet. Thanks."
"There is absolutely nothing foreseeably wrong with this product.I have been pleasantly pleased with the extra sense of security the Otterbox Defender provides.Speaker performance is in no way hindered,in fact..it seems to have added amplified sound to my phone....Thank you Otterbox Techs."
"Quality and price are perfect for this case. It is very small and practice.I recommend this case, it is perfect for travel."
"Apparently everyone who wrote a review received a different product, some got knock off xbox controllers, I myself recieved a very poor knock off of a PlayStation controller. You know its bad when its not even a knock off of the product you were trying to purchase. Terrible dead zones, weird drivers, etc. This was a poor and stupid purchase made at the last second. Don't make my mistake!Sending it back as soon as I can, I'll spend the extra money to get an official one."
"I love this screen protector, i didn't think it would be so efficient, I thought it was going to be a temporary one but it is not and I am really satisfied with it, Thank you very much!"
"I could watch this movie again and again! It never gets old. I hope my children will love it as much as I did when I was younger..and still do"
"Fits a bit small but deji kawaii. Super cute for our 3 month old.  A great for family picture out fit."
"Liked the design, but the stitching and sizing is horrible.. We will take it our tailor to try to make it work, but will not make a purchase again."
"TOO big, horrible stitching, seem stitched up rear and front center crouch.. terrible for spandex.. Would never ever purchase from this dealer again ever.. looked nothing like the picture...."
"Horrible total disappointment, bad material, bad sewing, and just plan horrible will never never make another order from them again.  bad bad bad  hate it.."
"Skip over the first 30-50 pages. It really doesn't have much to do with the rest of the story. Start when she first gets to her new job. Tha't where it gets good."
"I really enjoyed this book. It was funny as hell and surprisingly sweet. I might've even shed a tear or two.It wasn't the same old kidnapping book, this one was special, because I liked it and the characters weren't boring or always trying to hide their feelings from each other. It was action-packed with death-threats and sexual tension. It doesn't get much better than that."
"A great read/story and part of my family history.Gave the first book I purchased away so now I have personal copy again!"
"So many good suggestions and the book is well organized. Have gotten some excellent skin care advice and feel as if my skin IS looking better. Like the fact that the suggestions don't cost an arm and a leg but really target what is useful. Plus great diet and exercise suggestions! Respect Dr. Oz and am thankful to all the women who worked hard to bring this book about. Thank YOU!"
"The best external HDD I've ever purchased. Ever. Good brand, good quality.  Arrived on time and works perfectly.  Will be making more purchases in the future."
"I am sooo thrill that I got this film!!! If you are a believer in the afterlife, this will really open more of your thoughts of NDE. I strongly sugguest to all to buy or get this and see for yourself that there is more to this world (the living). If there is other films like this, I am going to get them as quickly as possible. I am a true believer as you can read this message. Good thoughts to all!!!!!"
"I love this movie and the first Expendables also. All casts are so good at this movie. Enjoy this at your best time with your partner. Watch it as much as you can."
"This is one the the best Wing Chun movie out there. Just follow the movie and you can understand what is happening! I truly enjoy this movie so much. If you are into Wing Chun, than you can appreciate this movie so much. Enjoy it!!!!"
"It works perfectly.  In fact I would not be able to type this right now without it.  The 90 degree angle on the cord works well as the wall outlet is usually behind you."
"Very poor quality. Arrived broken. Doesn't look solid at all. Would not order again. Even if it wasn't broken still looks cheap quality and feels cheap."
"I had my HTC Incredible 2 for a year now, and after it stopped charging or turning on I opened up the back to find corrosion where the stock battery and phone was connected! I cleaned up the corrosion and went looking for a new battery.This product fit all my needs for a good price, so I placed my order. Delivery was fast and arrived on the exact date it stated, the packaging was compact, the instruction manual was short and simple while telling me everything I needed to know, and it came with a warranty card should I want to activate it. I put the battery in, let my phone charge for about 10 minutes before turning it on, and it was at 85%, so I'm guessing it was pre-charged some. It didn't take long at all to get a full charge which I liked since my old battery even in it's newer days took a lot longer to get that 15%.Overall, great quality, exactly what I was looking for, amazing price, and speedy delivery. If you have a phone that needs this type of battery, get this one. You won't regret it!"
"So here's a REAL  REVIEW. This app does work, there are alot of people complaining about a good app.The Good:  So basically they've got Over a Dozen of there popular shows like Scandal, neighbors, Once. Plus several News programs, both Today shows, 20/20, what would U do &amp;amp; More. For a total of 25 or 30 different programs, maybe more. There are the latest 5 episodes of each able to use watched.The shows clarity depends on your internet speed and your tablet or computer. So the people complaining about it are just cheap. It will stream as good as Netflix or YouTube.Commercials:  Yes you have to watch them but there is one at the beginning of the show and Maybe 2or3 throughout.  You pay $30-100 for cable and have to watch several commercials every 7 mins. This is FREE and there are like 20 less commercials to watch per show. When I was watching nightline there was only one at the beginning.THE  BAD:  I've watched five shows with no problem but one time it did freeze on me. Another time there was a short delay at the very first show I watched there was a 15 or 20 second delay before it startedMY CONCLUSION:  Great Free App , I would pay for it knowing it's this good. I would highly recommend getting. I have a kindle fire HD 7&amp;quot;  I can't guarantee it works with all devices but it sure is worth a shot.  I have gotten other &amp;quot;so-called&amp;quot; tv apps and they didn't let you watch anything. This is different,  download it and you will be happy you did. Then like my comment for giving you such a great suggestion"
"Adorable costume, I did taylor it for a custom fit.  The shoes pictured are not what it came with, it had the white overlay triangular piece.  But we didn't use them none the less."
"Super value, super condition, works just like the original but only a fraction of the price! Would highly recommend for anyone."
"I can definitely recommend Fall For Me with all 5 stars!  The characters really got inside my head, and I found myself thinking about them constantly throughout the day. I couldn't wait for work to finish so I could keep reading. I had to sneak in pages between emails and meetings. The writing is very descriptive, and throughout the story I could picture each scene like I was right there with the characters.  And the twist! Wow, what a twist! If you like your angels and vampires, Fall For Me is a ripper book for readers of all ages. Please write the next one fast!"
"The cover broke as soon as I put it on. It was only a few dollars so I didn't lose much but it is the whole principle."
"This was a wonderful &amp; warm feeling read.  Recommend it highly for anyone that wants a good feel book to disappear into"
"They are really cool looking some are duplicates  great for the price really wanted the dark blue and black ones  but got mostly pink  which im not too fond of  but for the price its a good deal"
"Could have pages that were lighter in colour, a little hard to read. It did come on time to my home, Excellent service"
"It looks good but it is incompatible with  typing and the 5 way is hard to operate when playing the brain game."
"There are a lot of challenges. I like the many and varied different games in the product. I use it every day."
"It does not feel enough like a real game. The game does too much for the player. I probably should have expected that."
"What caught my attention to this book is the fact that the author knows diet alone is not the answer. Sure, you can follow the healthiest diet plan, but if you lead an inactive life, you wont get far. I now understand why the people of the mediterranean are so healthy! Delicious recipes as well"
"the style and color is great. But one thing I dont like is that there is no mic with the headphones."
"great style. Color and very beautiful. Measurement is accurate and stylish. I like it and want you people to buy because its greatttttttt"
"Excelllent and very fast. I like the style and color of mouse. Its smart but you need to care much."
"Not sure what was tearing up our yard but i decided to look for a repellant device and decided to go with this one. Electronics are good enough these days, to be inexpensive so I decided to give it 'a go'and bought two. It's pretty easy to use and it takes regular C-size batteries, and it seems to be doing the job! I gave the other one to a neighbor just in case they have the same problem. I used the AC cable and the extension cord but haven't tried the battery yet. Pretty handy!"
"Frameset is made of steel, but for such an attractive price, I don't have any complaints. Im going to use their other parts to build together a complete bike. I really like their styles."
"What works about this product is that combination of things. Not only does it have Chorogenic acid tohelp you burn fat, but also present is GCA. These compounds should show that this item is an efficientway to lose weight."
"Thank you for the Last Tango, this top is awesome! Style 1196 in black, now I am ordering other colors! love and love."
"Like every parent (so I believe) I look for practical advice - based on the experience of other parents, preferably those with professional knowledge.From the beginning I liked the H.H (Happy - Healthy) boundaries - managing the situation in a way that will obey the H.H principles. This was the first place I had to look myself in the mirror and admit that I don't always act in such a way... what can I say? This realization disarmed me! Made me open and receptive and strengthen my understanding that I need to change something in the way I manage daily situations with my kids.In a nutshell, this book opened my eyes and equipped me with great ideas. As my title says, I've already solved two ongoing issues.I think this book is a must read for every parent."
"Rear brakesets came with everything as packaged. There were no problems with this product. Used the size 23.8mm brake lever for my handlebar and the brake caliper reach was perfect for my wheels."
"When I purchased it I was wondering how it will be but when the product arrived I see I get exactly what I wan in need. Great product"
"I don't know much about scientific facts. All I wanted was to have my body back after childbirth. So I started to take these pills. These pills are so effective and work very fast. I got my figure back in no time at all."
"ARX Fast Weight Loss Pills seems to be a revolutionary new natural dieting and cholesterol pill that helps increase the body&amp;#8217;s metabolic rate and burn off fat. Not only are there no negative side effects but it also helps get rid of depression and bad moods by helping the body to release serotonin! It is a breakthrough in natural dieting pills!This could be attributed to the fact that it contains Garcinia Cambogia and Green Coffee Bean Extract. Both of these natural remedies help to reduce appetite, burn fat and lower cholesterol. If Dr. Oz praises Garcinia Cambogia &amp;#8211; well then it must be good!"
"My 7 Year old son loves this book. He memorised half the jokes already. He always tell me about the jokes of the book.I also enjoy it."
"I heard about these appetite suppressants but thought it was probably too good to be true. I try to avoid ingredients that aren't natural which usually means that I avoid products that work. Thankfully, that isn't the case here and the vegetarian ingredients really have helped me curb my eating......"
"Having family members with high blood pressure, this book was helpful, containing many practical steps. I was also surprised to hear that this diet was approved by the NIH. In addition, this diet is also effective as a lifestyle change, and I look forward to some weight loss."
"Ich habe viele Di&amp;auml;ten ausprobiert, aber ich war nur  mit meinen Ergebnissen entt&amp;auml;uscht. Diese Di&amp;auml;t hat den Konsistenzvorteil, da Sie keinen verr&amp;uuml;ckten Beschr&amp;auml;nkungen folgen m&amp;uuml;ssen,  Sie bekommen einfach  einen praktischen  Lebensplan. Ich w&amp;uuml;nschte nur  mehr Rezepte, aber das Buch ist in jedem Fall  hervorragend!"
"I'm in love with a kindle book. This one. I fall in love easily, but not always with eBooks as there really is some rubbish out there. This one beats the odds and I'm so glad I took a chance on reading it. The story is so well written that you feel as though you live in Isobel's world. I read it over two days and apart from doing the stuff I really had to do, I didn't put it down. Normally that only happens for me with paper books. I think I'm converted :)"
"At first when I heard about the Paleo diet, I was skeptical. But since trying it, I cannot get my hands on enough. So far, I've read a few of Michael's Books because they are good solid pieces of work. I have just tried a few recipes, but am happy with it so far"
"Great Battery wish I thought of this before I replaced a cell phone that no longer charge. Money well spend cheaper than buying another cell phone"
"Received fast appear to be in great condition the only problem I don't need. I ordered the wrong part but I'm keeping it."
"This what a excellent buy wish I bought this charger because my phone would charge any longer. I ended up buying a new phone but I needed my contacts from the old phone. I charged the battery outside of the phone was able to get the contacts. Wish I had thought of a charger before I bought another phone."
"Not really happy with these hose, they  seem  small in the ankle and calf in comparison to other brands the same size, the foot is way to big and the first time wearing a hole came in them..."
"Arrived super quick great product.I will be using them in the future do to the feid im in i need my order quick and correct i got both thanks again"
"I was pleased with the quick shipment and like the music on this CD. What more can I say about it."
"This was a Birthday present to myself. The music was OK.  It was sent quickly but given I ordered and payed for new the CD was not wrapped as new CD's are. The music played fine."
"I really liked this film . It is not one I had seen  before. Very quirky. But a nice old film."

"awesome! it does what it is supposed to do. it is just what is advertized and what i expected. Buy it!"
"besides the pickups and deans guitars tendency to have fret noise on very few frets, this guitar rocks, great action, awesome looking"
"Most ""how to"" or ""do it yourself"" books I have read through make me cringe with incorrect information or bad product advice. Mr Litchfield's book is NOT to be included in this category. Thoughtfully laid out with photos, easy to read descriptions and plans make this book a must have for anyone thinking of tackling their own project or hiring someone else. My Nephew has recently bought his first home and has asked for tools for Christmas. I can't think of a better tool than this book, (And it's far less dangerous than anything with a chord attached). I will also add a copy for each new employee I hire as required reading. Well done Mr. Litchfield!!"
"I enjoyed this game, but would have liked to have more interaction with the ghosts.  They were mostly just a shadow and not having much impact on game play."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Rear Guard"".  Engvyr Gunnarson is a character with depth and personality, and this episode in his life expands the reader's understanding of what shaped him into the leader he became in the first ""Rifleman"" book.  The complexities of life in his world engage the reader and soon you've begun to think of him as someone you know well.  This is the mark of good writing; you lose yourself in the story and are surprised when you turn that last page and find it's empty...You need this book!!"
"My daughter had only carried this to school for three days when it started falling apart at the top where the straps attach. A few days later it broke completely. I was very disappointed in the quality."
"would like to order the es 3833, too, but can't seem to find one...this is a very good shaver and nice for gifts...."
"I hate it, nothing like I expected. It is just poorly put together in every way. The picture makes it look way to good."
"Came within a day of my purchase. I was happy with the buy and they sound great for my room."
"Works better than expected. Not much of a bass from the outside but hits hard inside of the car. It was a great buy in my opinion."
"The height of the bed frame is good for storing as well. It's simple to made the frame, the head board can attach to the bed frame perfectly."
"I wish I would have spent the extra money for a better brand.  My daughter is only 11 and growing constantly so I thought this was a good option. I gave it to her on Christmas and she has worn it maybe 7 or 8 times but the buckle finish is already coming off and the belt finish is cracking, so instead of saving money it is going to cost me."
"Excellent great quality good size perfect for my 6 year old girl firts day of school everybody was asking where I get it and I said amazon my daughter is very happy with it cause she loves minnie"
"great screen protectors for the price they arethe way to go instead of buying one for $20 at best buy"
"I love watching Little House on the Prairie. I would recommand this movie and I give it a 5 star."
"I love to watch Little House on the Prairie. I would recommand this movie. I rate this movie a 5 star."
"I chose this rating because to me it was sad plus toward the end it was romatic. It was an awesome movie"
"I didn't like this product because it did not fit my furniture. I would recommand that you some how measure thefurniture before buying it."
"I enjoy this daily devotion very much. It is like spending time with a cherished friend while growing closer to Jesus and building a stronger faith. It also helps one to get into the journaling aspect, making for a deeper experience."
"Awesome look and fits perfect. Not too loose or too tight. I love digital camo so this is perfect for me."
"This product actually does something as opposed to many I've tried.  Now, I didn't drop 100 pounds in a week or anything miraculous like that, but I do find that I am less hungry than I used to be.  I used to eat due to boredom and a host of other little things.  With this product, I find that sometimes I'm not even hungry when it's mealtime!  This product has at the very least proven itself to be a good start in a weightloss plan."

"Great documentary. Finally a documentary that covers the subject of melanin. Very factual. Each commentator is exact and on point with information. Learned so much I hadn't learned before. Dr. Booker T Coleman and KRS brought nothing but truth. I plan on buying another copy for my friends and family."
"I bought this because normally you only get packets of 8-10 for a lot more. Great price, fast shipping, great coffee as always!"
"We were having a major spider infestation and with only one application of Cy-Kick we are already noticing a huge difference."
"Recently I was interested in playing a few classic Nintendo games and I saw this, andI love the look of the console itself, eeminds me of the famicom. Anyway, let me get into some pros and cons of the console.Pros:-Compatible wih almost the entire NES library (only a dozen or so games dont work)-Very cheap in comparison to the original NES &amp; NES toploader-It looks good, not as good as an original Nintendo, but still good-The 2 packaged in controllers are nice, they aren't pretty, but they feel decent and have good features-You can use original NES controllers, because it has the standard NES port-The console feels sturdy, but is very lightCons:-The plastic feels cheap, but it's not horrible by any means-A few games aren't compatible-The console is really light and that bothers me, I like hefty videogame consoles, you feel like youre buying something with more qualityOverall the console is a nice alternative to buying a Nintendo. You'll save a bit of cash and if you get some official Nintendo controllers or some nice 3rd party controllers then the experience shouldn't be any different from playing an original NES.4/5"
"What a wonderful gits this was for my husband.  He uses it every day in the garage.  Saves his back from aching."
"I am disappointed with the color of the pearls studs. they are yellowish, not a nice crisp white, this can happen if they  are not the last item on and first off they are very porus, and stain easy. hair spray and perfume are the most common offenders of this gem."
"This is an interesting way of writing the story of Alexander, I guess you must study History in order to realize, as in many other movies, that the story is totally changed, but at the end, it was entertained with it."
"It is a nice coat and it is actually better than I thought. I am not sure how many uses it will last, but for me it already worths its price."
"This was a gift for my nephew and he loved it. I was worried about the size but I guess he will use it at least for a couple of months. On the other hand, kids are easy to please when it comes to clothing."
"It was a great purchase, I have many of these pants in different colors, really good quality. I highly recommend them."
"I bought these with the hopes of only there rabies tags not knowing what I would get, with the good reviews I hoped for the best.They are perfect my three dogs now will be silent tonight for the first time in years.I would email seller asap to get your collars asap although she may email you before you can email her.Awesome seller awesome product."
"I chose this because the Book Rating A SuccessMegusto the book and learned so much in so little timeI recommend the book to Worldwide, Great and BoysTeaches You What You Need in your Daily Living"
"100% SatisfiedLiked the product I recommendThe Product is Strong and DurableWhat I recommend to people who collect"
"the main reason i chose this is for the color and the kickstand!it's asking me for more words and i'm done!"
"My sons birthday is coming up and as a lot of kids are, he is really into Mickey Mouse Clubhouse! This cake topper is perfect and is going to look so cute! Its good for the price and will make him party extra special! He is going to love his cake! I cannot wait for him to see it!"
"So far so good.  The Preface is detailed and informative.  I carry this book in my Kindle which makes very easy to read.  I hope to receive info on sermons and how to prepare them, as well as delivery."
"An older movie that was good.  The musical score is also good.  And it tells a part of history that gets ignored.  We need to learn from that history so we don't repeat it!"
"I hopen they turn this saga into movie.....i cant wait till the third book comes out...great love story..action.....i read this book twice,then read dreamless twice."

"Jennifer done a wonderful job...I like this young adult stuff .she kept me intrigued all the way to the end.well worth the money"
"They sent a bad code!!! ;(  I cant believe it man, I was super excited too! I just wasted 40 bucks."
"I love this case!  It fit perfectly.  It fits very snug and securely, and is made of a very firm foam.  The foam is so firm that if you squeeze it between your fingers as hard as you can, you can feel it &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; only slightly.  The swival handle/kickstand  is stiff enough to stay where ever you set it.  The Lindle sets in the case in such a way that, even if you dropped it on it's face, it probably wouldn't damage the screen.  (honestly haven't tried that)  I think this is an excellent case at a fair price!"
"Came exactly as described. It arrived quickly. We look forward to using them. Straps are plenty long for larger adults and fits easily over the head."
"Great show. Can't keep your eyes off. Kept me on my toes. Loved it. I watched it all in 2 days"
"I get a new pair every 9 months; this is my fourth pair. Great for those who have an indoor/outdoor job but still need to dress nice (engineers, project managers, etc). Good balance between dress and traction."
"Great tire, fits on my lawnmower. Will buy another one in the future for the other wheel. Installation was straight forward."
"I was dyslexic and this was the first book I managed to read ... heady stuff ... Especially to a ten year old genius"
"Just as I expected. Such a soft matte color. The quality is so good. Love it so so much. Looks adorable on my mac :)"
"I ordered this book and it came pretty fast. It is exactly as it described it; &amp;#34;used but still just like new&amp;#34;.I am very pleased with this purchase and I highly recommend this book."
"I have a macbook air and there is no CD drive installed into the computer. So this is the perfect item to complete my mac. I emailed this seller to make sure the item came with both the connection cord and the installation CD (the last one I bought came individually and didn't explain that in the description [not this seller]). The seller responded quickly and ensured me that it does come with all it's supposed to come with. So I ordered it! It arrived very quickly and in superb condition!Very pleased with this purchase."
"This item came exactly as pictured but when I recieved the item, it seemed extremely cheap. I've never held in my hand such cheap quality. And trust me, I buy a lot of cheap jewelry. It's fine if cheap is what you're looking for, but ehh. Wouldn't recommend it."
"I bought these shoes for the first time. I prefer to wear leather shoes in winter. I liked the design and the price. BEARPAW  very high-quality brand shoes. Shoes are very warm and comfortable. I have 6 foot size and the boots are the same. I'm glad my purchase."
"Great mobile dock easy to use and give you extra usage hours specially if doing doing a big project and communicating with family and friends. This is my first table and i enjoy it very much, its like you have a table and a laptop."
"the boots are light weight but they are not warm at all so the term blizzard is not correct I like the solid grip on them and the overall build is really nice"
"these pans are great for the price the are well built and easy to clean just rinse them everything falls off the pans"
"got this for my wife for x mas and she loves it she says that it is very neat and big"
"In this whimsical tall tale, author Kizzie Jones seamlessly blends her two passions, a love of dachshunds and a love of the sea, into a single charming story. Enhanced by beautifully detailed illustrations, this book is a  heart-warming and enjoyable read, and is as close to believable as a tall tale can get!"
"I've been a big fan of the codeword puzzles in crossword books. This version takes all the drudgework  out of guessing letters, filling each blank and erasing them all if they're incorrect. My only criticism of the game is that it is possibly too easy to complete, since you can check your answers at any point in the game. I'm going to purchase the unlimited version as soon as my free games run out!"
"Love this version of Scrabble! The computer is a decent opponent, using words that increase my Scrabble vocaulary in the bargain. Best parte? The computer wastes no time taking its turn!"
"I have enjoyed all of her books. What I like best is she keeps me guessing and trying to figure out who is responsible for what.  I really enjoy her style."
"Really creative ans awesome level the graph are so so real great levels really really cool you need to play makes mind sharper"
"this is really good and fun blah blah blah im just doing this for the hints but it really is fun you ahould try it but im just going to ramble because i have to use twenty words minumum so dog cat cute fun cool expensive lalala is it twenty words yet this is ridicoilous and i tottaly spellt that word wrong"
"Using this fab marinade for years,it's like my secret sauce ! All my stores discontinued showing this product on the regular space,for Mc Cormick spices. I tried contacting them and was led to your web sight. I'm sure glad I found you, I will continue to shop your sight.Laureen MorickCalabasasqueen@hotmail.com"
"Is helping me so much during my first pregnancy.  All my questions are answered, even ones I didnt know I had.  My husband has also found it very interesting and has read some of it.  It even covers what to do after baby comes.  If your expecting I suggest this book for sure."
"This shoe is so elegant and very classy. The only concern i have was it is a little snug in-front foe a 100% synthetic material, i had to exchange it for a size up. Other than that i had no problems and i'm planning to buy it in a different color"
"Movie was outstanding. Beautiful music. Very well performance of actors. It is a movie that will entertain anyone that loves jazz"
"They always say the book is better than the movie and it holds true with this trilogy. A story so fantastic you won't be able to put it down!"
"What more is there to say. These rims look awesome on my slash. They do add a little extra weight compared to the stock plastic rims but the ability to change tires in a matter of minutes is worth the weight. I found it a little difficult at first to get the tires evenly balanced but realized while trying I could have been driving off road with my newly bolted on mud slinger tires. Another great buy and a perfect addition to these great rims.(Two hex screws shown but it does of course come with all 6.)"
"Look great, a little wobble since it's difficult to set the tires evenly. Great for off road. Changing tires will take some time but much easier than gluing."
"I ordered these, expecting them to be cheap, but they were very nice. The color was identical to my Leg Avenue Classic Cinderella costume, and they are very smooth &amp; sturdy. It really added that extra touch to my costume, and I'm really glad I got them. Now, however, I have relatively long/narrow fingers, so it may not fit as well if you think you have thicker fingers. But for me, they fit like a glove *ba dum tsss*."
"There was nothing about this costume I didn't like. It was extremely comfortable, cute, warm, and everyone loved it! I wore it to a Halloween party and it was perfect for the outdoor bonfire. Even better, I've also worn it as pajamas for the cold Minnesota winter nights. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun and functional costume!"
"This is a book in the series that my husband has been reading....it was great to find it here and the price was great! It arrived in perfect condition and we are looking forward to purchasing more books from the series."
"I have been wearing this perfume for over 15 years...I LOVE it! It is my signature scent! :) I love purchasing it here because it ALWAYS arrives quickly and the price is AWESOME! I can't get a better price anywhere else!"
"this game is pretty cool because it is realistic all the other dress ups have to do with animated figures"
"I downloaded this and was having the greatest time playing it but I was getting low on gold so I decided to re install,low and behold I cant reinstall it,even after resetting of it says I still have it installed and I can only open it which doesn't work....sloppy job amazon sloppy job...."
"I like it, I felt the connection between the characters so much I end up reading the following book after that. This series could be a hallmark love story in their valentine episode."
"The men in the movie are not hot and the story was lame.  I would not suggest this movie to anyone."
"This story is different from Hamiltons' other books with Anita Blake.  It just shows where she stands with the police, not anything real exciting like her other books.  I enjoyed it but it really didn't have a purpose."
"This is terrible quality. The cord broke within a few days of having the charger. It just stopped working completely"
"It's not the color that looks like on amazon.... It's to tight on the phone!!!  The reception is bad once the cover is on the phone :("
"it was a gift to accompany the CD collection; the recipient is thrilled, which is great for me.  speedy delivery and every thing i have come to expect from amazon.  thanks so much."

"got a whole bunch of these door knobs for my entire house. And they gave a the house an elegant look. They are functional and look awesome."
"This item looks very nice. However when using it, you can tell it is cheap quality. I guess if you are on a budget, which I was at the time, then this item the good. If you can spend a little more, then you might want to get a different item."
"I have tried several products to prevent my baby from opening every single non have worked until I finally found this product. This item works great. It gets the job done. keeps the baby out of cabinets."
"bought this item for my 2 year old baby. He loves mickey. Nice product. Good quality item."
"As a teacher, it's always shocking how little resources exist for teaching about the colonies. However, this book does an excellent job of showing how delicate the relationship was between the Natives and the Americans. It also clearly illustrates the struggles early settlements like Jamestown had in dealing with hunger, disease, and the threat of attack. It's not overly graphic, but death plays a major role throughout the book."
"My son somehow downloaded this extremely pointless game. The redeeming quality of it is that it deletes easily. Other than that, I'm at a loss."
"Great product! Exactly the same case as sold at the Verizon store for alot less! I would definately recommend this product."
"This is the second book of the Confectionatley Yours series that I have read, and I am quite pleased. Teaches on how to never give up, even at the hardest times, and takes the life of Hayley Hicks and turns it into something that girls want to read. It definitely fulfilled my expectations and I am looking forward to reading another Confectionatley Yours book."
"This is a great study guide for the PHR. It is also much less than the self study software offered by SHRM. It helped me passed the certification exam. It is very thorough, but I would use another study guide as well to cover all bases."
"I bought this after my four year old broke this piece the second piece in my six year old refrigerator. It was a good fit. It seemed a little expensive for a plastic replacement part but it got the job done."
"I loved this book.  It is historical fiction at its best.  Would recommend it greatly.  Makes one think and remember."
"I definitely enjoyed this book. It was a good quick read, I would recommend. I HATE that Amazon has a requirement on how many words I have to use for my review. That's not necessary!Sometimes less is more!"
"Nice Stuff!!!!!"
"Performs exactly as advertised. Smooth and responsive. I use it with my ASUS TF700 Transformer Pad tablet. No problems at all."
"Looks nice and does a good job of protecting the tablet when I carry it around in a bag or rest it down on a hard surface. Quality seems good so far.The only issue I have is that the tablet does not fit snugly in the case so when I hold it upright in landscape orientation it slides down in the case and the bottom edge of the screen becomes blocked by the case which means the back, home symbols etc. are partially blocked and hard to press. Would suggest Velcro to secure the tab at the bottom as it slides out under the weight of the tablet allowing the tablet to move down."
"As someone on the verge of graduating and considering all the potential things I could do with my life, this story is so inspiring. The whole book is a great example of how couch surfing can create unforgettable experiences, and change a person's life. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to have an exciting and meaningful life."
"It fit well except I ordered the wide and it was too wide for me, but the shoe was well constructed."
"The fit was too narrow for size.  Sole was not very supportive. Overall also did not like the look of the shoe."
"The shoe was a bit too big and my foot was slipping out of the heel cup.  I might try a size down."
"This boot fits GREAT and it's EASY to pull on.  The top (leg) section though is a bit big (swimmy). Wish that part would be more snug. The look is classy for office or casual weekend dress up.  Very sturdy too."
"This is a great unit.  I only wish it had been about 5 inches taller.  Although nothing replaces a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; fire.  This is pretty cute and the heat can be well controlled with the remote. The wood color is beautiful (as pictured)."
"I try two or three time , but it still puff up after over night it look does not air tight ."
"First book I have ever read throughout with out stopping. Great christian family, smart, and Phil has done well keeping it all together!"
"This was a great product. I would recommend it to anyone. Look forward to many more purchases from Ikon Sign &amp; Design."
"Good laughs, but same old thing if you are into celebrity gossip. It's like she does not have any imagination for funny material, but then again that is her mo. The &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; list stuff. Not family material."
"It meet my expectations, is an interesting story, very real stuff in many of the cases, recomend to adults ONLY."
"The story is lame, very little dancing, too much bla, bla, lost interest in the movie, only two guys are good looking (Mat B and Channing the rest very ugly!!! :( Adults only (DO NOT recomend.)"
"Quality is good and it looks exactly like the original except it fits a little loose. The clips are a bit different but not a big issue. It does come with the bulbs and sockets and the price is cheaper than a recycled part at a junk yard if you can even find one."
"Exact replacement for the Kenmore filter that our refrigerator uses. You can't tell the difference from the OEM part and is a lot less money than the part sold by Sears. This is a no brainer. Save your money and buy these instead."
"Good protection when comes to water and dropping the  phone. But can't talk with the case on the phone, so if you can't talk with the case on the phone,  what do you want it for?  I don't recommend it.Order it in a color, got something different."
"I tried different types of Shea Butter, this is the Best of the Best! Don't doubt it, try it!  You will not regret it!!"
"The only problem I have is that I preorded this and did not find the blimp code, it wasn't emailed or in the case. So if someone could fix that it'd be awesome."
"I was missing pieces so I am not able to put it together. This was a christmas present to my boyfriend so i was upset."
"I was happy that they delivered what they promise. I have a little Smart car that needs to have a loud horn and it does it well. I am very have with all the items I have purchased from Amazon"
"There good but just not for the thickness of my hair... I can still wear them but I just need ones that match my course hair"
"Das Buch ist eine glaenzende Abrundung der ersten beiden Teile! Eine wunderbare Kombination aus heiler Liebesschnulze geparrt mit Sex ! Prima"
"Another great book in the Bound Hearts series by Lora Leigh!I would highly recommend this book and the complete series!"
"Perhaps I should have known, but the inside of these cards are dark and thus hard to write legibly on. Otherwise the cards are fine. Very plain, but fine."
"Excellent it works just like is meant to work great price good product!  Just make sure to install ezcast to device"
"Amazing!!! Love this series!! Must read, you wont be disappointed!! I love Layla, Blake and Axelle!!  So happy Jonah and Raven are back too!!"
"I bought these to go with my Bluetooth headset in case the original one broke. Fortunately I haven't had to use them yet but it's good to have them on hand."
"on time and good description of item. would recommemd to others. now i'm just filling space to satisfy the word req."
"good description ot item. would recommend this item and buyer to others. now i'm just filling space to satisfy the word req."
"A very well written book.I had trouble putting it down.The characters were very real and it seemed like you were there beside them with each page.Looking forward to them following.. up book."
"Perfect gift for a family member! It arrived on time and was good quality! :)"
"Good quality wig, but the blonde is much more yellow than the photo depicts  :("
"Very thin and not as long as the photos :( After waiting over a month to receive this week I was very disappointed with the quality and length."
"This is a great quality wig, however it is a much lighter shade of red than in the photos.. also the ends are wavy with no curls :("
"Arrived quick and is great quality! :)"
"This is my absolute favorite wig! I have purchased maybe 20 in the last couple months and this was the best quality! The shade of red is beautiful! The photos honestly don't do it justice, the ends are more curly (which I love!) I plan to buy this same one again once I wear-out the one I recently received :P"
"Guardian in training Rose Hathaway had been on the run with her best friend, and moroi princess, Lissa Dragomir for 2 years when they are finally caught and returned to their school St. Vladimir's Academy.Upon arrival they are escorted to headmistress Kirova's office where is decided they will both continue their enrollment at said school.Rose must balance her life when others try and knock her down while struggling to learn to control her bond with Lissa.I LOVED the Vampire Academy series. All 6 books. They are by far my favorite books in all time followed closely by The Bloodlines series. I am not an english teacher and am quite rubbish at writing to be honest so I wouldn't be able to critique her writing style but I absolutely love these books."
"Makes me wish I had a monkey. Not to blow up with a coconut, just have around. Also makes me wish I could've worked in more places instead of just the Gulf of Mexico."
"I was going to buy the longines, but decided on this one at the last minute and love it.  Not too big and not too small.  Very well made and I just can't fault it.  I think anyone who buys it will be very happy."
"really cool sticker, and has a really good stick onto my mac. I would recommend this if you would like to spice up your computer!"
"excellent price for vitamin E, and the gelcaps are easy to swallow.Kirkland  has the absolute best value when it comes to vitamins and supplements"
"Did not come with Power Cord.  Power cord is needed for constant projection to work. Set up is fairly easy with the instructions."
"Be VERY careful when buying this product. Please read the rest of my view if you&amp;#8217;re considering of switching to a 4.A little about myself to understand clearly:I've been playing since 5th grade. Ive been section leader and 1st chair for 2 years. Currently a senior in high school.Review:These reeds are EXTREMELY hard to play at first. After my first practice, I was physically exhausted from trying to play. At the time, I could not even play a low D. Gradually I have been adapting to the reeds but they take A LOT of air.Pro:They play a lot louder. (It's probably because it's forcing you to push more air than usual, but still)Articulation is easierDynamics are easierCons:Physically exhausting the first couple of timesRequires a lot more air (This is actually a pro)Very hard to play lower notes (Still working on anything below a low C)A little more difficult to play quieter (Not very noticeable)Conclusion:Don't buy these reeds. If you&amp;#8217;re still in high school, buy a 3 or maybe a 3.5 if you&amp;#8217;re really wanting to switch. I love Vandoren but #4 reeds are a little overkill."
"Right out of the box I could tell I would like this product. I came from a Logitech M100, a standard computer mouse with 1000 dpi. Right after I plugged it into the computer, the mouse flew across the screen and I was amazed. I now run at about 3300 dpi.Pro:More dpi than I would ever needSoftware is very nice. Alot of ways to program your mouseCan turn of LEDs if you want (Can also auto turn off when the screen shuts off)Amazing feel for palm gripCons:Packaging had almost no wear, but there was just a tad. Not a big deal, it's hardly noticeable and doesn&amp;#8217;t effect the mouse at all."
"When I saw the optical port, I assumed that this card had Dolby or DTS on it. It does not. This means that your optical port will only transmit in PCM, AKA 2 channels. This makes the Optical port nearly pointless. Although, I did get true 5.1 surround sound using the ports on the sound card and my receiver that has multi channel input."
"TL;DR:This is an amazing deal if you want all the apps and have more than 1 user, or want some of the apps and have 3 or more users.---Office 365 provides Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Onenote, Outlook, Publisher and Access for five people (of those 5 people, they can have it on a desktop and/or a tablet). The closet comparison to what Office 365 provides is Office Professional 2013. This version provides all of the previous mentioned apps for 1 person to use (only on their desktop I believe). Here is the math I figured:---Assuming that Microsoft Office releases a new version every 3 years,The price of Office Professional multiplied the amount of users using it$400 x 5 = $2000With this $2000 payment, you would have these apps forever for 5 people.The price of Office 365 multiplied by the amount of years the version exists$100 x 3 = $300Over a period of 3 years, you would have all of these apps for 5 people. Once Office is upgraded, you would have the new apps and restart the equation.---Therefore, if you plan on having 5 users, needing/wanting to use/have all of those apps and upgrading your Office every time there is an upgrade, you would save $1700. Now there are ways that Office 365 could be more costly, such as these:If you use all of the apps and have 1 user. *You should buy Office 365 Personal in this case *UNLESS the subscription key card if same price*If you only use some of the apps (Buying Office Home and Student 2013), have 2 or less users and upgrade every versionIf you only use some of the apps (Buying Office Home and Student 2013), have 4 or less users and upgrade every other version.---Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. Now me and my loved ones can all have Office on our computers and iPads for a relatively reasonable cost. This is a very smart purchase if you know exactly how you want to use the product."
"I found it to be very creepy and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.  Too close to reality for me."
"I was highly disappointed when I received this book.. What I ve being paid for the purchases of this book.. It's almost same price for new book jus $1 or $2 compared! But to my surprise, the book was so dirty, torn and worn.. It doesn't what amount being for."
"This was exactly what I wanted!!!!! Very happy! Soft blue case &amp; hard black shell. It was worth the wait :)"
"Aldrin this guy did a great job for me, very very smart and helpfulnice to know there is still good tech supporthave told a lot of friends about your product and my brother has three of your cameras and mysister has four? ha hathanks again you get 100 stars ALDRIN"
"First couple of pages I didn't think no would  get through this book but then I got so into it an  I didn't want to put it down. It made my heart swell and I just love  everything about  it. This  book is.  Keeper for sure for any girl that loves love stories. It's about commitment, denial, heart ache and of course love."
"I loved this book. It was one of those books that you love to jump into and get lost into the fantasy that awaits the characters. From start to finish there is always something going on that catches your attention and makes you want to read more. At times I found it hard to open my kindle and find times to read so it was hard to get into the book again because  I was frequently having to stop. I think this is.  Great read for any fantasy reader."
"I put this on my LG phone and at first I thought it would be  another cheap phone case but it looks durable and nice. when I got it I snapped it on and I don't have any complaints. I can take it off without braking it. plus I have a one year old that loves to throw it, drop it, and eat it. it has protected my phone  an  the case hasn't come off from any of those things. very happy with this product."
"I think this book is defiantly worth reading. It is very wordy and you won't want to put it down."
"Works great and really protects the phone.  I'm 70 years old and it keeps the phone from slipping when I slide the keyboard."
"Good quality feel. Realistic food that can be used for a number of items such as kitchen play, shopping or feeding dolls. Hard warning toys that look to be designed for many years of play."
"Love that this product promotes a lot of skill usage. I have been impressed with the quality and look of the product. My daughter has to use, fine motor, cognitive skills and role play. Would buy again in a heart beat"
"This tripod is complete junk. It is poorly made and did not work as needed. The tabs to push into ground bent in soft soil. Also the connection to the level broke off after 3 times of using the tripod. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
"Awesome if you actually do it. It has shown me what has been important to me and more importantly it has shown me what should be important to me.Justin A. Tripon"
"This song is so good I downloaded it from two different albums just to make sure I had it right!"
"I downloaded the free version from here (which turned out to be an older version); after the program updated itself through the developers' site, I found that even though it's nowhere close to Microsoft Office (it won't even change fonts like the online user's guide shows, nor will it let me print anything for some reason) the interface is decent and there's not a lot of clutter on the screen. The main problem I found is that to have the truest professional version of this program you have to  BUY the Windows-compatible suite (at 50 or roughly $120!) Let's face it, shall we? If we wanted to spend that kind of money, we wouldn't be looking at freeware, now would we?"
"High quality, box just a little scratched from shipping. Great product though I really like them good color, wonderful. Id get them and I already did haha. I don't really know what else to say I just need more words for it to submit."
"A friend recommended this book to me and once I started it I could not put it down! The author has a way of making you feel like you are in the story. All my friends are now reading it and they love it just as much as I did! I hope the author will write more novels in the future, I will definitely read them."
"I love those markers and I use them everyday so thats why I gave them that rating you see posted"
"I've noticed a difference in my appetite cycle by using this product. Combined with a regular exercise regiment this will definitely help loose weight rapidly."
"I have been taking this for a month now and combined with the Garcinia Cambogia and Raspberry Ketones supplements this seems to have boosted my energy levels and I'm feeling generally more active."
"Talk about love at first sight, well this is love at first scent! This is a warm, inviting, sophisticated, romantic scent!"
"Grow light functions as advertised to date, and was delivered on time with no visible defects.  I would buy this light again if i need another."
"I bought this for my wife for Christmas.It had been recommended to her,but it was difficult to obtain seconhand in U.K. She hasn't read it yet,but is looking forward so to doing.I was pleased with the rapid service and Quality of packing."
"Workaholics season 3 was a very enjoyable addition to workaholics series, as the character's stories are further developed in their usual comedic manner, and I very much look forward to their upcoming fourth season."
"Was dissapointed with it,was expecting better results. Try different amount nothing seam to work any better so overall not satisified."
"Excellent movie. Will keep you on the edge of your seat up until the end. Superb acting.  A must have for a home video library."
"If your a lover of these guys you'll rock out to this.  Some great old songs. You'll be happy with it."
"While queen was a fabulous group and Paul Rodgers has a one of a kind voice, this cd is not great. The sound quality is garbled.. From beginning to end 3/4 of the music barely heard due to fans screaming, clapping etc. Without that background mess it would have been very cool."
"I bought this book for my son who welcomed a new Mastiff puppy in Sept. When I flipped through it it looked quite good."
"Each bag is only filled about a 1/3 at the most.I would eat 3-4 bags at a time easily.I did some pricing and found the best deal on cinnamon apples is at Trader Joes or Whole Foods.You can double the amount for the same price."
"I looked EVERYWHERE for a night light bulb that would give off a soft, beautiful glisten. I bought a box of 25. These are beyond perfect. They look orange but once plugged in give the nice color you'll love. Not too harsh."
"I have already read V.A. Stuart's- The Sepoy Mutiny, The Cannons of Lucknow, The Heroic Garrison and The Valiant Sailors which I have enjoyed.The Vistors and Lords became a bit tedious especally in the early chapters.  I would give it a 2 star rating.  I am looking forward to reding Massacre at Cownpore.."
"I haven't yet been able to actually use the guide but I received it very promptly and am looking forward to using it on a upcoming trip.  I also like the fact that is is small, laminated, and can be put inside a pocket easily.  Looking forward to using it."
"Fantastic, informative read, well worth the read.  Easy book to follow and really well written.  Thanks for putting in so much hard work and investigation."
"What can you say it is what it says. It is new, fits, and works. So i am very Pleased."
"What can you say. It is what it says it is. It fits, and works. I am very pleased with it and the price."
"Love the color and quality of this cover. I almost did not get it cause I read a review that it did not fit someones samsung galaxy 10.1. They must not have known what size thier tablet was cause it fits mine perfectly. Great price. I seen same  one at officemax only available in black $98.00 and at walmart only available in black $58.00. So I am very happy with mine."
"I got 2 of these one for my 308 and one 223, had no problems installing what so ever. The key is to push the roll pin out just enough to get your old latch out. I used an old o-ring pick to push the roll pin out just enough to get my old latch out."
"Fantastic book! Very well written, not a lot of cheesiness (IMO). In this genre, there seems to be a lot of one character being just OBSESSED with another - to a scary degree. This book didn't have that, which was a refreshing change. I recommend this entire series. You won't be disappointed!"
"Im not about the spoilers. K Bromberg's Driven Trilogy - just read it, you won't be sorry. Plot - check. Romance - check. Steaminess - check. Angst, Heat - check &amp; check. Seriously. Read it."
"Essential for anyone interested in theology related to the old and new Testament. Very deep and a bit meandering at times, but still recommended."
"It's a good choice for hot beverages but not too safe because the movements it spills out if its full"
"I have been wanting a set of wax carving tools for a long time.  These are just what I was looking for, and at a very affordable price."
"LOVE the book. I got it for my sons first birthday as a sign in book &amp; for future lifelong memories of his 1st year. It was exactly what I was hoping for :-)"
"These tools were very easy to use. Made doing my hair extensions a snap. The combo kit was the cheapest i found anywhere but it was well worth it."
"My son loves this game. I had it on my phone now on his tablet, I can finally have use of my cell back"
"I was very hesitant on starting this book since it was based of an marriage relationship gone wrong, since I am more of a mystery thrillers fan. But this book surprised me page after page. Gillian flynn's writing has an absolute new take on how a individual could think about their life partner, so much as that makes you feel a chill running down your spine. In the middle before i reached part two of the book, I didn't know if I should empathize or sympathize with the narrator. Since both the characters take turns on every chapter to have their very own personal view on marriage (which I loved), Gillian knew how to play with her words and form her own visions of dramatization.Since everyone had given their own personal synopsis on the story I wouldn't dwell on it much.It is a dark thriller which makes us question who do we really know in our lives?Can any of us be the true self and not a facade of personalities we try to pretend?Go for it if you like any sort of Dark mysteries."
"Exceptionally well written, was intense, action packed. Amazonian meets tomb raider along with a punch of love story which will get any women's toes curling. Dark prince was indeep was a page turner,finished it in a day and half all the while dying with anxiousness . Hoping this new twist in the end will only make the series much more exceptional. Well done Kresley Cole"
"loved it!had the right amount romance good plot.I looking forward for more books from this author.the push and pull story between the witch and werewolf is something of a lovely excitement.the irresitable drive to be with each other is amazing!if you are looking for a erotic romance novel for a short read of your day go for it!"
"I love it! I have lost 14 pounds in 2 months with taking these and watching what I eat. I don't have my cheat days but I still see the weight coming off.It gives me energy. I haven't had any cravings. I can see my stomach shrinking."
"At first i was a bit sceptical of this series but it turns out Im really liking it Starting to be one of my favorites"
"they do not stick to textured walls. they fell off our walls within hr or so of putting them up."
"chocolate taste great! but was all melted and stuck together so it was messy and we had to cut off pieces to eat it.. but it still tasted wonderful."
"they are good and nice and convenient but they don't seal well enough the paint will thicken and start to dry out after a while"
"its alright, the tray to hold paint is to small for those nice no spill paint cups... and its very hard to find the paper roll size unless u get a very skinny one or buy directly for there website.."
"I love this planner.  It was displayed nicely and is exactly what I need!  It even has inspirational quotes.  LOVE IT!!!"
"These earrings are great!  The price was good and they came rather quickly.  Also, they have a notch that helps secure the earring onto your ear so they don't fall out of your ears."
"These fit my iPhone 5 S perfectly.  The price is great and I couldn't be more pleased!  I recommend this product!"
"These are not the real thing..sound is terrible compared to the real galaxy earbuds.. definitely get what you pay for!! In addition to the 3 weeks it takes to ship from china!!"
"I am 59 and primary cook ""certified foodie"" in the family. My wife has asked me to prepare special diets to keep weight down for both of us at times. My experience has been that while we have kept weight off with South Beach, long term shopping requirements were too intense and unsustainable. The meals were also not satisfying for the level of cooking I enjoy. We would go on South Beach and lose weight, go back to normal schedule and put weight back on and repeat process. The cauliflower ""fake mashed potatoes"" grew pretty weary as a Julia old school French cooking fan. Forget the no wine phase. Great glass of wine after a long day is well deserved. There are several pretty good meals on Doctor Oz such as the tofu tacos and shredded chicken BBQ that really surprised me and are normal weekday new additions worth a Google.About six months ago I started many of the recommendations mentioned in the book before even reading it. I get to keep my passion for trying new dishes with best fresh ingredients but just limited portions. In the past I would eat whatever portion the host or host put on the plate so as not to offend. Now I always tell the host or hostess I am on portion control but want to sample every thing they have prepared.Bottom line, I would rather have a small serving of great food than my previous life where the pounds would add up with no portion control. Add a reasonable level of exercise and I have dropped weight from 180 to 160 in six months and still look forward to dinner!A nice add on to this book might be the best dishes author has tasted in his travels. If I am going to have less, I want the best."
"They should list what size bottles it does fit.  Buyer beware.  Cheap plastic, tube does not go all the way down to the bottom of the bottle either."
"shipping took a bit longer than expected though i bought a used one. I have never owned a Dyson or a similar in price vacuum, the reviews i read stated that this one has stronger suction. My parents bought a vacuum that needed a small loan to buy and I can tell this one is better. More importantly I don't feel like I'm going into battle carrying around all the attachments with this. Even the hose has a better and more controlled suction."
"I'm convinced that I received a knockoff. This is my 4th time purchasing an OtterBox product and I have never had this problem before. my last OtterBox lasted almost 2 years and during that time only one of the clasps broke. But with this case only two of the inside clasps are left and it's only been 3 weeks of usage, every time I'd go to unclasp it one of the clasps would break. I would never order from this particular seller again due to the fact."
"I could not stop watching it...... I didn't want to miss a second.. I literally was on the edge of my seat..."
"This item did not work. I tryed so many thing but they just wouldn't work. I would not recommend this item."
"I wear these under my cargo mtb shorts and they are so comfortable. Long 30 mile rides in the woods are great with these things on. Makes the saddle seem like a big cushion without significant bulk. Awesome construction and price...Buy it!"
"These pedals are rad. They have a big platform which is great if you're making the switch from regular pedals to clipless or just like having more leverage. They're high quality and at a low price. They may be a bit heavy, but they are super strong."
"Discovered this scent in a department store and loved it. It's high end, without the high end price. For a bodyspray, it has that great CK cologne scent. It reminds me of a mix between Nautica Voyage and Adidas Moves. Buy it!"
"I really like this watch. It serves its purpose, looks great, and is at a great price. Buy this bad boy."
"The game keeps my 7 and 4 year olds occupied and competitive.  They love trying to figure out how to beat each level.  I love it too."
"I love this stuff! i cant find it at any store so i have to order it online. im in the military so i have to have my hair in a tight (no fly-aways) bun Monday through Friday. Its a great hold and you can brush it out easily with a flake free mess. There is no damage to my hair and it seems to be growing faster than usual!"
"I really am enjoying this item it is so much better than I expected it makes my Nook expirience so much more pleasureable there is an opening for the speakers an elastic band to secure closure when not in use not to mention the stand to hold in an upright position I love it!!"
"I liked everything about it!!! One of my all time favorites right behind breaking dawn 1.  They were all fantastic"
"First off, I am a 20 year old male. This product is simply amazing. I have had it about a week, and used it every day so far. I bought this item in hope to clear up my acne/acne scars. I had little hope when purchasing this item due to the fact that I have tried so many different things to clear up my face. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING comes close to this. Like I said, I use it once a day mixing with water, and leave it on roughly 15 minutes. Your face feels so refreshed after you are done. I noticed results in just a couple days of use. Ladies, and gentlemen there is obviously no &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product out there that will just clear up your acne instantly, but this is about as close as it comes. Well worth the money, and honestly I think it's a steal. I would of payed far more money if I knew how well this product worked. I even let my sister, and mom try it, and they too liked it a lot. So before you go waste your money on stuff like nuetrogena, or clearasil; try this Aztec stuff out. Trust me, it will give you much better results, won't irritate your skin, and it's also healthy for your skin unlike most other face products. Anyways, I am very pleased."
"To be honest, I picked up the novel only after hearing about the upcoming movie. So I didn't really have high expectations. But boy was I wrong. The story and the whole idea was great all in itself; but the story-telling, character development and attention to detail were on a refreshingly high level. Give it a try! Watching the movie will never give you the same level of satisfaction as reading the novel. And that's presuming the movie turns out to be decent."
"I can't express how happy I am to have found this app to read and re-read the graphic novels I had already bundled up on my laptop. It's a real joy! And it organizes all the books in shelf like GUI. That's a nice touch too."
"This was the perfect setup to watch two games simultaneously. I had one match running on tv and the other on my fire HDX through this app. Flawless playback, no delay or lags. 5 stars from me!"
"It was a brave attempt to take the angry birds franchise to a turn based RPG genre. And since the game doesn't take itself too seriously, it actually works! And a ton of fun to play."
"Its charging my phone the way its supposed to and I do not have to move the cord around to make it work."
"upgraded the hard drive in my laptop with this ssd, its like lightning speed now. great buy at 300 bucks on black friday"
"I was only able to play for the first half hour, before they ask you to buy the game. I'm hooked so I'm definitely going to purchase this game. You won't be sorry if you are into these types of game. Definitely a five star."
"Different,addictive,some levels in the game (for me) are very difficult. Because the items listed to be found are very well hidden. Have to be fast or time will run out."
"Really interesting read, very easy to relate to and gives some perspective on starting a business from a rookie point of view."
"This show is entertaining and has an interesting storyline. The dancers are amazing and so fun to watch. Great show!"
"This show is not Bravo's Best. The case really do not do anything interesting and the drama is very contrived. I wish they would focus more on Joey and Amanda's building a business."
"The hat was nice just poorly made its already ripped in a week. And it was poorly described the way they worded it you thought you was getting two hats and you really only got one"
"I absolutely love my kindle fire HDX. It's quality is amazing, the screen resolution is great. The features are perfect. The only downside is that it doesn't have a huge selection of apps. But other than that it's perfect. The movies look amazing on this, and the speakers sound great. For the price, this is a steal. It's also super fast."
"I've been playing this game for  while and absolutely love It. Until the new update. It says to download the new update and it takes me to the app store but doesn't give me an option to update it!! I'm very dissatisfied. I would appreciate it if you would fix this please. I loved this game."
"I really enjoyed this book, it kept my attention, I highly recommend both books, can't wait to read more books by Shan!"
"True love overcomes obstacles ... Personal and professional.  When family should be there for you, they cause pain instead.  Luckily, people close to them become their support network instead.  Can't wait to read the follow up book!"
"Yes... It could!  This tender love story introduces Ryan and Zack.  This composition could definitely be added onto, with more of their future being shared with avid fans of Aria Grace!"
"This is a sweet tale of a boy falling for his first lover ever.  Emotions run high as he is attacked by an unknown assailant and he confronts his own sexuality."
"Lives can become so intertwined that only years later do you understand the causes and the results of so many people's actions.  The story of Noah and Cooper's love for each other transcends years and brings them full circle.  I am so glad that this is a series that continues to tell about the community of Blackcreek.  Riley Hart is a talented author with such a gift for story telling.  I look forward to reading more from her."
"Riley continues to remind us that love can overcome so many tragedies.  These men have survived childhoods that would have 'broken' most of us and were still able to give and receive love.  A message that needs to be broadcast to every corner of the world."
"Jay and Sam meet in a remote part of Montana but Sam's past takes them on a whirlwind, circuitous trip to Los Angeles... Where it does not live up to its' nickname... The City of Angels!  Nude sketches by a hippie artist, an inept FBI, bouncers and hit men guarantee a wild ride for two men holding onto each other while hoping for love."
"But needed more!  Of their budding relationship, the mother's involvement, how they fared against Cromwell.  Was there a word limit requirement?"
"What a sweet sentiment!  It helps that the story was great and his fantasy came true.  I'm going to have to get the book that preceded this to find out how they ended up here!"
"I love it when characters can give up control and admit their need for their lover.  When they can say what they need without fear of ridicule or appearing weak."
"It always seems that people take awhile to figure out what they need, whether it is their job, their friends or their special person.  Just don't give up until you find the perfect one for you, whomever they are.  Everyone has their own special 'perfectness!'"
"Even Doms make mistakes and subs have to be courageous enough to call them in it.Beautifully written.I love to read more about the men in the bar, especially Law."
"Excelente livro, facil leitura e bem divertido! Algumas situaes do dia a dia do canteiro de obras, desconhecidas (ou ignoradas) pela maioria das pessoas so demonstradas com bom humor, numa linguagem super divertida. Por v&amp;aacute;rias vezes me senti dentro dos di&amp;aacute;logos, como se estivesse por tr&amp;aacute;s do tapume argumentando com algum oper&amp;aacute;rio sobre a textura da pintura ou a posio de alguma janela. Muito bom. Recomendo."
"My daughter loves it she sleeps with it and takes it everywhere when the show comes on she makes sure she has him"
"This is a good value/look product, very easy to install, and they look pretty good comparing to their cost/value, Great craftsmanship."
"GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE AND EXCELLENT FAST DELIVERY"
"LOVE THE SOFTNESS OF THE MATERIAL,  AND THE GREAT PRICE AND TO TOP IT ALL THE EXCELLENT SERVICE THAT AMAZON OFFERS WITH THEIR AWESOME DELIVERY"
"Ok well this book has a great hook and really drags u into it so it's really great up until the end which isn't very good. But up until the end the book shows what true ""equality"" and ""conformity"" is."
"Simple and to the point, just reinforces the basics that we all learnt but usually forget to put into practice."
"This was exactly what I was hoping for....organized, very high quality and an adorable design!  The price was great too!!"
"Very pleased with this buy. Looks good and light weighted, lots of storage capacity. Very stable. Read speed is great when reading large HD media files."
"I think the shirt is funny and comfortable to wear under a sport coat. Many people have complimented me on my purchase."
"I dont have negative stuff to say bout this cause i like it :) i ordered it together with the in sax mini8.."
"I had never heard of the Piano Guys until I saw them perform on Katie Couric's show.  I went on the computer and heard more of their music. Then I was sold!The CD puts everything  in one spot.  They are quite talented."
"I have enjoyed quite a broad range of vampire movies.  Some good, most bad.  This movie was not bad.  It was far from good though.  Some of the scenes were good and pulled you in.  However, Bill Paxton's character was putrid at best.  If your bored and alone, watch it.  If your with others, I would skip over this title."
"I had a flatware set that I picked up from Big Lots.  They started rusting after 6 months.  After a month of research, I bought this set.  They have a good weight to them and the style feels good when in use.  I especially like the beveled tip on the handle.  I fits in such a way in your hand as to make it feel secure.  The knifes cut great!! My only complaint is I wish there were more spoons in this set."
"I love this movie.  It is a situational comedy with great view of Ireland.  Well worth the purchase.  I laughed from beginning to end."
"Man these things are bulky!!  They sound VERY good. The controls are nice.  The mic works without fiddling with it.  I have found that they can last for 5-6 hours of non stop use.  The charging cable plugs in the back so you can still use when plugged in.  Works on my PS3 as well as my computer.  I think they were worth the purchase."
"This was the easiest to use.  I used the stock battery and the stock back.  I opened the back, placed the connector (to top left arm thing) in the connection that is above the battery on the left and put the cover back on.  That is all there is to it.  Using the case by Aduro, it works flawlessly."
"No matter what I did, I could not get this cover to go on correctly.  Luckily there is 3 in a pack!  That way I could mess up 3 times in a row.  This is a good deal, even though I failed."
"Wind 'N Go Portable Lantern/RadioThis was a Christmas gift and person thought it was really good and great item for their use"
"This magical mirro is very cool, and my baby girl loves it very much. I can't find it in Taiwan."
"This is a wonderful true story of Ben Carson, and a tribute to his mother's bold faith and persistence.  He continues to have a great impact today, and is an inspiration to all about what God can do in a life."
"This book is a delight.  I used it as a treat when I wanted respite from correcting papers and preparing lectures.  It gives a nice picture of Paul the person.Robert PattonProfessor of MissionsCrown College of the Bible, Powell, TN"
"This textbook is several decades old, but remains very pertinent to the cause of missions.  We still use it as our textbook.  There are more recent texts, but they do not match this text in terms of readability and ease of comprehension."
"I read the first volume, written about 50 years ago.  While I would have some differences in theology and approach, Hodges has written a classic!  Rereading this book was very helpful to me personally when I was looking at the time to finalize turning our ministry over to nationals and return to the USA.Robert PattonMissionary to Suriname"
"This book is extremely helpful in understanding in a compassionate way the Insider Movement, and yet revealing the fundamental flaws in the movement.  I appreciated the overall tone of the book, which is not blasting the attitude of the insider movement, but demonstrating that the movement is attractive but unbiblical and fails to lead to strong Christians among Muslims.  There is a basic fallacy in theology in the Insider Movement that is clearly demonstrated.  This spills over into translations which have been creating major problems in a number of Muslim countries."
"I have read about 30 books on the Biblical translation issues, but the author approaches the issue as a professor of English rather than from theology or textual issues.  While I disagree with the author on his preference for the critical text (which he never discusses, but obviously prefers the English Standard Version), I appreciated his critique of the modern translations as inferior from the point of view of English literature."
"Helpful information; more than I could absorb as a beginner in podcasting. I appreciated the information on equipment as well as the techniques involved, and the use of RSS."
"The author is himself a Muslim converted to Christianity.  He writes clearly and in an interesting manner.  The differences between his former Muslim beliefs and his Christianity are clearly outlined"
"This is a good solid program which was helpful in learning to use Adobe Presenter 9; after the program, I was able to prepare online classes in SCORM format without difficulty."
"I was impressed that the movie stuck to what I have read about Carey's life rather than embellishing it.  His life is a great challenge to all that he indeed expected great things from God and that through him God accomplished great things."
"I sometimes show videos in a variety of classroom settings.  I need amplification in different sized classrooms, one of which will seat over 90 students.  This set of microphones is small enough to travel on my cart, simple enough to set up quickly, and powerful enough to fill the room with adequate amplification"
"I have read the major books by Don Richardson, and appreciate his ministry and message.  He emphasizes the possibility of a cultural equivalent to present the gospel, and thanks to his emphasis, I was able to find one during my time in Suriname.  However, as opposed to Ee Tauw!, he presents the people as they are in the raw, which makes it difficult to show in mixed audience with so many bare breasted women.  I realize that this is reality, but makes it difficult for me to use the film."
"Spurgeon writes concisely and powerfully against modernistic inroads on Biblical Christianity in the Baptist Union of England in the 1880's."
"Good tasting gum but does get sticky after a while of chewing, you could probably hold something together with it."
"Got for my mother, at first it was fitting loose but after wearing it in she likes them, No wires and comfort strap works. Great price from Amazon for these as well. She says getting harder to find good bras in local stores anymore."
"It's ok i guess, when spraying out it sometimes never comes out of can evenly. Also it is kinda strong smell at first, so might want to check your allergy to it first in a small test area. It does mask odors or etc for animals or just heavy traffic areas and will die down on odor strength after a few hours or a day. After  three days though its not even noticable but no odor."
"Simple construction but nice finish, has a small hole on top back for hanging. this is beautiful made cross and makes any wall look good. &amp;#34;also good for the knees&amp;#34;"
"Perfect for filling up oil in my car which has a plastic cover over the entire engine bay and the oil input is kinda sunk down a little. Plus it can hold the quart of oil for you."
"It's nice it comes with compound and strips, also the ergonomic plastic handles work well. My only complaint is i wish the diameter of the spikes were smaller in size, other than that it will work."
"It's ok for a regular face size and for the money works well, but for a large face man like myself it looks kinda small on me.Durable lens and plastic design, appears as if you could switch out lens."
"I like it because according to my sister my nephew loves chewing on it! I guess it works well on him with teething as well as brushing."
"Good plastic container for the price to put oil in after each change. holds 12 quarts. Afterwards you can take to a recycle center and pour it out. Only thing is I wish it had a better made lid with better seal because eventually it will wear out."
"Got for my nephew who likes transformers, he liked the somewhat confusing opening and manipulation of getting each picture to show. So far they haven't torn but are made of heavy paper design, same as we had as a kid type stuff. overall price was good."
"Ever ate good georgia pecans roasted? These are just like the ones you get at walmart or nutsonline. Peanut oil cooked roasted pecans at 30oz!!! Delicious."
"This is a good bath brush. Soft bristles and once piece wood design with lanyard. Just a sort of soft to medium scrubbing feel from bristles and once piece wood so not to fall apart or decay as fast."
"was nice, gave it to my mom for her bedroom. I think overall quality of wood and finish was nice"
"Got it for my dad who like me has no padding in the back to keep up our pants, it works really well for him. 2 inch wide with sturdy gripping teeth on ends and adjusters with carhartt written on it. I think it will last a while."
"I use this with my PC for TV using Charter provided cable box &amp;#34;Motorola digital&amp;#34; box not HD. Using blaster on front of cable box IR i can use my windows media player remote only. There is some lag from box but that is normal even with the charter remote to the box. lol  Works great! Windows 7 with Hauppauge tuner."
"It works ok, sometimes the spooling mechanism gets hung up and cord does not want to wind itself. But for the price you get what you pay for, overall a short good retractable cable for using any phone to aux usage."
"Seems to have really good battery life and the ability to go side to side of back with buttons makes things quicker at work. Also the software that comes with it makes the mouse a robust little operator."
"Worked very good this past summer at keeping mosquitoes off of us here in the South. Was new to Picaridin but seems more safer than DEET. Smells not too bad and had that skin so soft softly feeling."
"Portable and multi functional at a low price. Makes great gift or stocking stuffer for christmas. Also can fit on a keychain"
"Dad loves to collect wheat pennies and each year I buy some just to let him search through them, this is his favorite thing to do. I think he is hoping to find a 1909vdb S LOL"
"Accumulair makes some pretty good filters, we use the Merv 6 to Merv 8 ratings and buy as a pack. It will last us a year and seems to filter really well without straining the system. forget buying 3M ones these are the ones you need."
"Once put together and all it's a neat little mesmerizing little science gift to watch. Made of plastic and metal with magnets."
"Helps my mother get up and off toilet and she is on the heavy side. It is somewhat flimsy in some ways as the front doesn't mount down but it allows for moving up to clean! overall i found it good. I did however have to modify the seat as the plastic tabs on back stuck out further than probably most would."
"Strips work well and the device it goes with works well. I use this brand as either main use or backup to other devices for glucose."
"Works dang good, has light at end for seeing yourself to the tire stem. Has backlit screen showing tire pressues in lbs or other increments. Cuts off after a minute or so or you can hold down and turn off. So far has been better than most Accuair gauges."
"Haven't had time to fully try this out long enough but so far it doesn't bother my allergies and seems good for now. Will try to update this again later at its Anti Fungal properties."
"Good trimmer for around $10 or so, the battery that came with it was dead so i put in a good sanyo oneloop rechargeable battery and this thing is good for trimming hair. Ever see the info commercial of similar product for over $20 this beats that way by far. Again Wahl gives you the bang for you buck."
"Works good for me, no irritation and smells good for two days even without a shower. Overall the dry solid is best choice as the clear gels are messy and seem to not last as good. Appears to have the same amount of metal as others in it but this brand works best out of using right guard, mens dove, axe, mitchum, or old spice."
"Detail is superb for something made of resin. Its head and fangs are nicely done and overall height works. Going to make a good gift."
"Very beautifully done piece of glass and detail is superb. When i got mine it was broken at the stem &amp;#34;most likely caused by UPS slamming boxes around&amp;#34; but i was able to glue it back. It was shipped very securely wrapped but not delivery driver proof."
"Good little hit, did not know this was a religious type song. Has that good bad to the bone style beat."
"It fits like a hard case on back and keeps it tight, the back is that gel rubber which i don't care for as it tends to be slippery especially with oily hands like me and leaves streaks. The sides are a rubberish grip but more hard like a plastic than real rubber. It's ok but the perfect one would be this with real rubber gripping bumper sides with a back the same."
"Fits my note 2 good and does not slide off too easily and snugs it just right. Sometimes lint may stick to it &amp;#34;but that is because it is rubber like&amp;#34;. overall with the skin on it i can dock it in my desktop dock that has pen holder style with no issues. Also gives good gripping surface while using brodit. Overall a good cheap purchase that beats the crap out of a folder or hard plastic type case."
"Can buy these at dollar store cheaper, came dryed out on some of the cherries so not sure if old or just shipping etc and temperature. Stick with original flavors as these taste just like them."
"Was free, has good beats and good tone. Likable some not sure on the group as a whole yet. will see later"
"Neat little usb charger that makes lights appear to move with the flow. Very nice to use in a car or at the office."
"Wonderful to hang on the wall for those who can't see well and enough space to write reminders on the dates."
"Seen this from a lana del ray recommendation video and i have to say this album has many great songs to listen to."
"These are the best rechargeable batteries on the market, i still have sets from years ago that charge."
"Kimbra is kinda strange but that's a good thing, this song reminds me of some bjork stuff or 90's smash's. It is catchy and has a good beat."
"Nothing brings back memories of watching little house on the prairie and highway to heaven series. Like the waltons and other great tv series that taught good lessons in life &amp;#34;sadly replaced by trash on tv today&amp;#34;."
"These pens work very well.  They are a different way to enhance scrapbook pages.  Can't wait to try them on cards."
"This item keeps my friends coffee warm while she is beginning her day.  Her coffee is ready to drink when she wants a drink."
"This product works well.  I recommend it.  Scrapbookers can use it to further enhance their pages.  Give it a try."
"Because it works well. I've used my friends cartridge and hated to keep borrowing hers. It is a good one."
"THIS CONNECTION PRODUCT WAS PURCHESED FOR A NEW MONITOR.  WE ARE PLEASED WITH BOTH ITEMS, THEY WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER."
"These skechers shape ups S2 lite sneakers are really comfortable and the color is just right.  The heel of this shoe keeps my heel from hurting."
"These are beautiful glasses, they are unbreakable and  they match other patterns also.  These were a gift for my daughter."
"THIS HAS BECOME MY GO TO SHOE.  I HAVE TO MAKE MYSELF WEAR OTHER SHOES SO I WON'T WEAR THIS ONE OUT."
"i loved it so much better everything I liked the idea of the cave stunt that was very smart. I wonder was you guys are going to do to temple run 3.... you should stick to the cave still."
"Good!! This game is a fun game for game nights. Which you can use to see just about how good you are at recognizing different brands."
"I downloaded this app yesterday, thinking that it'd be a not so fun game. but it's a great app !  My kids love it and they just can't get enough of guessing all the movies that they've seen ! *.* ^~^"
"It's a bit of work getting this thing to fit in the air box"
"Got it as a gift, I ride a Yamaha FTW! But my bud likes it so no complaints, buy it."
"How can you not love Kristen hannah?  The story take so many unexpected twists and turns it is hard to guess what is coming up next.  Good read but a bit slow getting into."
"All I wanted was a pair of boots to easily slip on to take the dogs outside or run out to get the mail.  The &amp;#34;lug sole&amp;#34; is slick so that is out of the question in anything other than perfect weather.  The boots make better bedroom slippers than boots."
"I buy these shirts for work but the sizes run so different.  This one was tight across the shoulders but length was good.  I ended up giving it away."
"I ended up cutting the hood off - just too much material.  Lounger is perfect for when you get out of the shower but not warm enough to lounge in on a cold winter day."
"This is the greatest little stick vac.  I bought one from Sears and paid 3 times as much.  This one I bought for a friend who lives in an RV.  The suction is good but the removable handle is worth the price.  Best hand vac I have had."
"The colors are so bright and distinct on the flag.  I bought it for fall and Thanksgiving.  It is beautiful"
"I bought 2 sweaters to give one as a Christmas gift and one to keep.  They really are pretty and the quality is OK.  Unfortunately I ordered XL but received Med.  These fit a size 2 but certainly no anything larger."
"I like this gloves a lot but the padding its not what i was expecting, much harder than i thought."
"The short its fine, but it is too small and obviously too short. but the padding seems to be ok."
"Very nice cover, however, it was too tight that i had to break one of the ends to take it off my phone.  Now struggle to keep it on.  I had three men try to take the cover off!!!"
"Fast and painless shipping.  Thoroughly pleased as product was just as described.  Local Toyota dealership already engraved the key and my wife is now good to go!"
"Great story, For all people that love watching a heart warming movies and battling anime its great. It has just enough mix of both, I would give the advice for all 15+ to watch it. it came in great condition from the provider and in time."
"all was great and loved the series. I would just like more series on there since im a great one piece fan but all in all im satisfied."
"This product is a genuine Dell product and is exactly as advertised.I would not hesitate purchasing this product again if needed."
"I bought Nupro powder instead because I ran out of Glyvo-flex.I will never buy that again! I will  buy glyco Flex from now on.A big fan.Pills are so much easier than smelly powder."
"It gets dirty soon as you touch it i hate i got white wish i capfuls swap it out. It was very clean when I got it 20 min later wow the sweat from hands ruined it."
"Very comfortable! Classic look, we bought these for my nephew and he loved them. These shoes can go with anything, and they are made well."
"Awesome...already saved me from a couple of tix! Love it and recommend it! It is a must buy for all who like to go fast!"
"I originally purchased four Mr. Beams MB363 wireless LED spotlights with motion sensor and photocell.  Electronic ordering was very simple and that is saying a lot as I am very electronically challenged.  They came as promised and the batteries insertion was easy.  However, I was most pleased with how very easy they are to install anywhere!  Or, you can simply just set them on a flat surface without securing them as I did inside my garage.I then bought 4 more...and 4 more...and 4 more...to make a long story short, I now have 23 of them all over my yard, sheds, patio, around my house and on my greenhouse.I have also purchased 6 of the Under Cabinet Lights, MB852, to put in hard to see closets.  You can also set them on a flat surface to get great illumination when you enter a room or hallway.  They are also very easy to install and I put one on a small table in the living room that points toward the front door at night.  The LED light is so bright it will definitely ruin an intruders night vision for a while.  I highly recommend these lights for price, ordering ease, installation ease, longevity, brightness and you can put them anywhere you want."
"Big fan of Law and Order SVU so of course I had to purchase this item for myself. Fell in love as soon as I seen it."
"To begin with, PS4 was very difficult to buy. Amazon received some stock from time to time but minutes later they were already gone. I bought mine in January and received it within 3 days.The console itself is great - the looks, the way it works, etc. One of the things I like the most is the ability to plug in your headphones directly to DS4.No 'blue light of death' so far :) (some people experienced this problem during the first couple of hours of using PS4) - I've been playing AC4 for about 40-50h now.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase"
"I love this game. And all the levels bring a small challenge. If u are good  with logos this totally your game."
"I like the song.  It has a catchy rhythm.  My granddaughter loves to dance to it. It does have one adult word. Not serious though."
"I have been using this product for 2 months. It has supressed my appetite but have lost no weight AT ALL. I'm going to have to try another brand."
"This game is the app you would want to get because it's fun addictive and of course, full of animals!"
"One of the only toys my dog couldn't tear apart in minutes! A few weeks later and its still intact!"
"Received sooner than expected and was a perfect fit. Good phone cover and exactly as described on the site. I'd used them again."
"This book is so amazing, it made me cry so many times and it also made me want to change some things about myself. The ending is so amazing and unexpected. I loved it so much! It's the best book I've ever read!"
"I love the Grinch and I was happy last year when I found they are now selling the Grinch Village. I bought two houses last year and now I decided I want some people. The quality is great and they are very detailed. I feel that these items will eventually be collectors items later in life. They add great charm and happiness to the Grinch Village and look just like the Whos from the orginial Grinch."
"This is a very good book and cleverly written. It keeps you engaged with the characters until the very end."
"Well, the stainless steal fell out of the first one I got but good on the seller for shipping me a new one right away. I got a second one which looks better then the fist one and seems a little more solid. Hopefully it lasts. But seriously ... it looks really really impressive."
"This game is a HO game, and as such is not outstanding. Some of the objects were too little or camouflaged in the background. The atmosphere and sounds were appropriate to the story of this game which was a gloomy and spooky one.It has a decent length to it. I give it three stars because of the graphics that could be better."
"This very short story did not have any imagination and creativity. Erotic should be more interesting than just a tryout in writing porn. The plot was nothing exciting or believable. It was well predicted and silly."
"I purchased this game for two excited kids that love playing this game. They love it! it makes them happy and it makes me happy that they love it. They like wandering in this open world game, with their tools and smashing everything and building stuff and they pretty much are well entertained by this game."
"This dvd was just pure awesome i loved it. It was then best thing ever im talking ever oh my god it was awesome"
"The book captures the pioneer spirit of those who have settled this area of our nation and continue to remain. A good read with a historical look at an interesting situation.Book received in excellent condition."
"Have tried the sample an  it was really entertaining especially for younger kids. Would have purchase the app if i have a kid of my own"
"I like the fact that the graphics are great and playing is really addicting. What I don't like about it are the ads that constantly crops up which is pretty annoying and you also need a fast and stable connection to be able to play it continuously."
"I downloaded this App but uninstalled it because it hangs up my kindle fire. Would really love to play this game. :("
"I'm giving this a 3-star, would have given it a 5-star but my kindle fire hd keeps hanging whenever I open the application and have to restart for it to function properly. Otherwise, the pictures are great and crisp, it jumps out on you and you would love to try it out for yourself."
"This is a great movie, also a great book, Toomy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin both gave great performances. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone."
"These are great for zeroing a scope, pretty heavy duty carboard, instead of paper. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they were smaller than I expected, but I was a police officer for 17 years and I'm used to shooting full size targets, it's just me. These targets are more than adiquate for an air rifle or pistol."
"I bought this hoslter for my Gamo p25 blowback pellet pistol. It's made of good heavy duty nylon and stiching. The extra magazine holder is a plus. Would easily serve as a good holster for a firearm. Heavy duty velcro hold it in place on your belt, can't go wrong whether buying for air pistol or real firearm."
"What can you say, it's the best CO2 on the market in, my opinion. I use them in a Gamo p25 Blowback, and they just seem to last longer than the cheaper brands, even though a blowback pistol is going to go thru cartriges faster than a none blowback anyway. This is the only brand I buy."
"This is one great scope, it's easy to zero, and after about 200 rounds, thru aGamo Silent Cat it's still on the money. The only fault I could find is that the mount that comes with it is too low, I had to remove the front and rear iron sights to get an unobstructed veiw. I'm thinking about ordering the Instapark high scope mount, with peep thru, so I can put the iron sights back on. This was the first time I had heard of the Hammers scopes, but I understand it's a common brand in Europe, especially Germany. I can't say enough good things about this scope, I plan on purchasing a Benjamin NP rifle in the near future, the Centerpoint that comes on it is trash bound, this is the scope that will be mounted on it. You can't go wrong purchasing this scope."
"Ecellent movie, Gereard Butler is th man, but it makes you think, with the way technology is today &amp;#34;Could this really happen?&amp;#34;"
"Apellet pen is the only way to go when loading a break barrel air rifle. I gave it 4 stars because the little deal that pushes the pellets down could fit a little tighter. It very easy to accidentily push the pellets out."
"If you are into biker jewelry, you will love this ring. It is very well made, fit perfectly. The detail of the Maltese (IRON) Cross and the flames down each sides are flawless.  You can't beat the price for a ring of this quality."
"This oil is okay. The smell doesn't last long. Only one day on a cotton ball. But it does smell good in a diffuser."
"Questions were rather simple, &amp;#34;What is your favorite food?&amp;#34; etc. Not very thought provoking, but not too bad for long car rides."
"Not a bad movie, but not great like the first. Still better than the second. My 7yr old loved it."

"The worms arrived quickly, however due to a slightly ambiguous email from seller I thought they would not be shipped until the following week so the day they arrived I didn't check the mail.  The next day when I checked it I thought my worms were going to be dead because it was well below freezing that night and when I opened the package some of the dirt was frozen.  I got worried but then I spread the dirt out and let it thaw and in an hour or so all of the worms were wriggling away happily.  All of them were alive not one had died.  When I put them in my worm bin all of them burrowed and none were left on the top."

"Fed Ex goofed on my order a little and i was confused and wrote the seller. within i hr of e-mail he called me and even tracked my package for me. Delivery was quick and i got to say i love this rack. Doing bench out of this rack is wonderful for powerlifters as the brackets are minimal depth so you can rocket into press position without readjusting your shoulderblades, minimizing wasted energy from unracking into the start postion. same with squats. there are many holes, very close to each other allowing for some very fine tuning on start position of your lifts. Great product amazing deal for what you pay and a seller who works hard to take care of you. i will come back to him soon"
"They Miss out on alot of great border battles such as Sark in 1448. It is a very sloppily written book that caters to a false image of Scotland in the past, and uses a great deal of sweeping generalisations."
"The book holder was great. It would be perfect and do the job if it was wide enough at the top to fit my treadmill. I wanted something to set my kindle fire on when I was on the treadmill and ordered this holder but it is not wide enough at the top to fit over the lip of my treadmill. Nice holder though!"

"The K &amp; N system installation into my 2002 Tundra went very well with only one exception - the hole in the tube for the mass air sensor was not properly placed in relation to the threaded screw holes.  I had to use a half-round rasp to adjust the size of the hole in the tube to allow proper alignment for the screws that hold the mass air sensor in place.  Other than that, the installation went well and the performance is what I expected.  Very satisfied with the system."

"This is Ellie Holcomb's first full length album release as a solo artist. Her first two EP's, &amp;#34;Magnolia,&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;With You Now,&amp;#34; were excellent recordings and left me starving for more from this incredible vocalist. Her first two EP's, by the way, are fantastic. Great voice, great worship,  full of Scripture. Why don't &amp;#34;Christian Record Stores,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Christian Radio,&amp;#34; play this stuff?! Why? Because it's not full of a  crunchy contemporary sugar coating. There aren't any tired cliches here or boring musical arrangements. Christian radio isn't for everyone I guess. I prefer independent and more obscure artists. And Ellie Holcomb seems to be just that. The first song, &amp;#34;As Sure as the Sun,&amp;#34; starts out with a vocal gently saying, &amp;#34;There is good news...&amp;#34; Amen to that!! This whole album is great and worth the asking price and more. I won't review every song, as you can preview them and form your own opinion. I will continue with the first song though. Ellie sings, &amp;#34;You could never change, no matter what you do. You are loved, more than you know, more than you could hope for, after everything you've done...&amp;#34; This song is a reminder of God's unending mercy. And I need this song. I need to be reminded that God's mercy chases away my wandering heart, which is forever prone to wander!! The rest of this album is just as solid. Full of reminders of who God is and who we are in light of His Word. (If you are familiar with Leslie Phillips, aka Sam Phillips, you will probably enjoy this album, as Ellie's voice is similar in sound.) So if you're still reading this, stop. Buy the record!!"
"This whole series has given me just enough to keep reading, but not enough to be satisfied. I basically only read the final book just to see what happened. I was pleasantly surprised that I did enjoy a lot of the book. But the end really fell flat.*Possible Spoilers, but I'll try not to really give anything away*Let's start with the good. The plot is very interesting. This is really what kept me reading. I love Dystopian novels, and the world he created and the mysterious plot was really cool and definitely made me want to read more. I wanted to know more about the world, WICKED, and everything about them. Sadly, when you finally read about what they are doing, it's just not satisfying. Not terribly, but just a bit anticlimactic. I wanted something more. He doesn't explain the reasons behind most of my questions, like why do they have to be put through sooo many awful things, so many deaths, and so many horrible situations? And yet practically nothing good? What was the point of the people being able to speak to each other in their minds? How did this government get so many resources while the world is practically destroyed? He just barely describes what they were doing, but doesn't delve into them at all. Wow... I already set in on the bad of the book...Well here is the rest of what I think is bad..The character development is poor at best, just like the other books. The first definitely had it the strongest, not that it ever was too strong, and the sequels didn't improve. The characters are pretty flat. The interaction and dialogue between characters don't ever seem completely real. This could've been avoided if we were lead to really care about the characters. It's not the weakest character development, but it is one of the weaker parts of this book, and the series as well.I often am finding Thomas to be putting tons of care into some things and characters that I don't feel he should have. I'll try not to give anything away, but when a certain character tells Thomas that he hates him and tells him to leave him alone, Thomas says that it was the single worst feeling he's ever had... Really? There have been countless people dying around him, some that he even really cared about like Chuck from the first book, and he's been lied and hurt and betrayed by other friends and especially the girls... and yet this is the worst feeling he's ever had... I think Thomas has the Flare bad and it's been affecting his brain and his emotions far more than the writer is letting on.*Definite Spoilers*Okay so if you've gotten to the end, here is where I was dissapointed the most. Teresa. She was such a big character in the first book, and even the second. Now she's a nobody. The writer tries to bring back some bit of redemption and some kind of emotional reaction from the reader at the end. But Thomas doesn't seem to care when she gets smashed, and neither did I. Being such a big part of his life I figured Thomas would care a bit more... But nope. And then it was such a letdown. Three whole books of WICKED looking for a cure, and this last book title ""THE DEATH CURE!"" and yet nothing.... LAME! I felt like all these characters, every single one in the book went through this giant adventure and all this pain and suffering all for nothing... And where were they at the end anyways? Nothing explained. Nothing further to understand what's gonna happen to the characters next. I felt like it built up to a strong finale and then just fell down and pitifully ended. Very dissapointed with the end.*End Spoilers*Well yes, rant over. Like I said in the beginning, the book was captivating, kinda. But the end really let me down. I think with a little creativity, and some more effort, Dashner could've made something amazing, especially out of the end. But instead it felt like a first draft that was shoved out into the market..."

"I chose this case for extra protection, since I have 2 iPad dropped by my children; both resulting in dents on the corners and cracks on the screen.  And those damages occurred despite having regular cases (folder / organizer type).  This time I wanted something sturdier and more rugged.Most of the ones online are too bulky, and I expected to get the same.  I was surprise that this stronger and more protective case (for sure) is in fact more stylish, hip and slick looking than the organizer types.  I love it."
"This is a perfect size for a small space in need of a light. This lamp met my expectations and I would recommend it."

"Very thorough and provocative research. Profound information correlating the social norms of today's young with the subliminal and covert messages deriving from the entertainment industry."
"I chose 5 out of 5 for this because this game is original, traditional fun.  This is one of the few 3d games for Sonic the Hedgehog that actually satisfies.  A lot of people say it's a rip off of Mario Party, but they're wrong. While it does share a few of the same elements namely because it's a gameboard based platform game, the music and overall experience is totally different. In this you shuffle cards, you don't hit dice.  In this game it's wittier and more intriguing.  It is refreshing and interesting to see how Sega woulda have done it. The intro to the game was nice, the story is fluent, and some of the minigames are a little odd, while providing humor and fun.  There's a bit of button mashing but not an awful lot to hurt your thumb or get sore in your palms, and the controls were developed well.  The levels were pretty kool. I really liked playing on the ship and the train, and in outer space. The other very exciting thing about this game is that when you fight the boss, they still have an actually boss area, with switches you must hit, not to mention that all Sonic's friends (Knuckles, Tails and Amy) get to join.  The boss and story to this game was very odd yet satisfying. Great job Sonic!"
"You can play it online. That's the benefit of having this.  The control is terrible until you change it, as well as how fast your character moves and jumps. It's hard to shoot targets, and the story is a classic.  Cool collectible but not extremely playable."
"This game actually came to me cracked, so i had my money refunded.  Stuff happens sometimes.  It has good games on it, but where's the Sega genesis classic Pac Man adventures game?  Does anyone remember that game besides me?  We'd like to play that again."
"If you're a Shadow Man follower like myself, then you know you gotta get this game.  However, it doesn't live up to Shadow Man Senior.  Let me explain.  Shadow Man is a black guy from the city down on his luck after failing his college courses, and squandering his resources with gambling and booze.  When a line of ShaMan and a Voodoo Priestess get mixed up in the line, Mike is transformed into the ShadowMan, Lord of DarkSide, or hell basically.  But with great power comes great missions and ShadowMan is required to collect Dark Souls before A certain demon named Legion does, and create demon humanoids bent on turning the world into a fiery carcass carved out of hell.  This game has tons of blood and gore, and VERY CREEPY sound effects, such as clawing people and pigs squeeling or the detestable screwing and surgery done to an infant somewhere in the back.  You also have to acquire different powers that enable you to do things such as swim in lava, climb walls of wire and coal, climb blood waterfalls and more.  This game is one OF THE BEST GAMES EVER developed.  Control appears a little stiff at least on the N64 version, which also has terrible graphics for this game.  I have heard the PlayStation version is way worse as well.  So, do the smart thing and grab it on Sega Dreamcast!  It's obvious a lot of care was put into this platform, voodoo cursing, biblical testing serial killer chasing game.  So the first one was A BANGER.  What about ShadowMan 2?  There are some cool new elements to it.  I like the fact that Shadow Man is bigger, and the special effects added to him when he enters Deadside is cool.  What is a little irritating are things like not being able to hack through wood with a machete, fighting three or more enemies all at once using unimpressive and unimpressive control scheme for fighting as a human, and dark region areas.  Even brightening the screen didn't do much for me on this game, because you'll still can't see anything. Even if you do manage to reach checkpoints and discover a few new levels and secrets, all in all it's super difficult to advance.  I cannot advance in this game yet, not even with the walkthrough.  By the way, if you find a walkthrough you're lucky like me, because it was almost impossible.  So if you love Shadowman and want to rise to the challenge, go ahead, buy it.  But this game is waaay too hard before it actually gets started."
"I finally got the game to work, and it plays just great. I don't think I could ask for a better version."
"Not only is this game a great novelty item, but it's interesting and fun to laugh at.  I like games with characters, cheesy punch lines and innovative gameplay. This is one of them."
"Simply put, it came in perfect condition and works just fine.  You need the correct games and possibly the keyboard for it to work though. It didn't take long to come in the mail and the price was good so i recommend it"
"My last Dreamcast burnt out on me.  I played it on and off for about 7 months, and then one day it just took a crap.  I even took it apart and put it back together.  Nothing happened.  When I saw this Dreamcast, and for a measly $65, quite frankly I was worried it wouldn't work.  Fortunately, not only does the product work great, but it even included a controller.  Since it's the sports edition, it came in black AND with the cords.  Now I got extras.  It was a good bundle, and arrived in a timely manner.  The only downside?  The button is a bit sticky!lol"
"This book is awesome!!!!!!!!!!All of you people should read this book.Great job Jeff kidney.sorry if that's not how you spell your name."

"For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]One year has passed since Laurel found out that she was a faerie. Even if she has come to accept what she is, she refuses to turn her back on her human life. But she is summoned to Avalon and now has to spend the summer to learn everything about magic and the world. Trolls, romance and a lot of information in this book.All these descriptionsIn this book, the author really managed to captivate me with the sceneries. There were a lot of descriptions that really made me imagine the places, without being too much and slow down my reading. But she also managed to leave a little to the imagination. The scene, or rather scenes that come to my mind are when we discover Avalon. All the details and the adjectives Aprilynne Pike used made it looks majestic! I wish I could see this place in real.Finally some detailsWe discover a lot about fairies and their world in this book. It was necessary because we didn't have a lot of information in the first book about any of this. The world is so developed, I loved learning about Avalon, the different types of fairies, how this world works, etc.Some development for the love triangleI  loved what the author did with Tamani and Laurel. Their chemistry is amazing. Tamani says some beautiful stuff in this one, I like him he is passionate and sweet, he would do anything for her. I could feel the tension between them and I want to know what is going to happen with this love triangle! About this love triangle. I don't mind them in a book if it's done right. In this book, it's not about if it's done right or not, but more about Laurel. I loved her in the first book, but I found her terribly cruel with the two boys.Love/Hate relationshipI don't know what to think about Laurel anymore. As I was writing previously, she's cruel. I understand she has conflicted feelings about which one she loves but sometimes she does unnecessary things that hurt one of the two. I also found her careless even after Jamison told her to be careful. While reading, I found myself thinking how dumb she was...I really enjoyed the book even if Laurel was annoying. I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see if my intuition about Klea is right."
"Even if her grandfather Lawrence is now back in New York, Schulyer is forced to go live with her uncle Charles Force and his two kids to keep appearances to the eyes of humans. If the interdiction to see her grandfather and Oliver is not enough, Schulyer has to live with Mimi who hates her even more after what happened in Venice and Jack, her forbidden crush, who won't even look at her. The Conclave now knows that what Lawrence always believed is true. When an ancient source of power located in Rio de Janeiro is being threatened by the Silver Bloods, they all have to fly to the exotic city of carnivals and beaches to discover who is behind all this. Conspiracies, secrets and a lot of plot twists!There are a lot of books about vampires out there. This one is different from them. I feel like Melissa de la Cruz did something new and great with this series. What she did with the concept of immortally was really interesting. I never read about something like that. Vampires live a human lifetime then &amp;#34;die&amp;#34; until they are called again on earth. And they have memories of every lifetime. She also did some funny and plausible explanations of the myths about vampires, like why they catch in fire at the sight of sun (it's because they can transform themselves in elements like fire) or why humans believe in such things as soulmates because of twins in the vampire world that are meant to find and be with each other in every lifetime. She also mixed vampires and fallen archangels which I enjoyed.As for the characters, Schulyer is a great heroine. She loves her friends and family and would do anything for them. At first, she's not confident at all and throughout the books, she's becoming more and more confident about her abilities, but also about herself and her appearance. I love when we see an evolution like that with a character, it's essential in a series that characters change after what happen to them. My favourite character is Oliver. At first, I didn't feel like that about him and I wanted Jack to get the girl, but I'm not sure anymore. Oliver and Schulyer have so much in common. He's loyal, even after what he learns around the end, he helps her in Rio de Janeiro. He's perfect for her. But with what was revealed in his Repository file, I'm not sure I want Schulyer to end with either one...There was a lot going on in the third instalment! And the end. The end! I was so stressed with all that was happening! I had so many questions as to what was going on in this book like who is the man in the white suit? What is happening to Bliss? etc. The only thing I could do was guess. A lot was finally explained in the last pages. I had some things right, but there were some plot twists that I never expected. I have so many questions left and the end brings even more of them. I don't know why, but Bliss' parents look shady. What they did with the Watcher was weird, something is going on here, I'm sure of it!I really enjoyed the book and I have the next one on my bedside table, ready to be read. For me, it's the best book of the series so far!"

"Mine came in with scratched glass in 2 places and although the photo shows finished wood on the inner part of the top in the photo, mine was not and I was informed none come finished.

"These are great little earbuds. Fit in the ear nicely. Give great sound quality. These are my new main earbuds. Recommended for those looking for a great earbud at a low price."
"I chose the cucumber melon scent. This product is highly fragranced. The scent is very pleasant. This is also very moisturizing. You really only need to use a little at a time to get the job done. Also, my dog has sensitive skin and this did not break her out. So if your dog needs to smell better or has sensitive skin this is for you!"
"Nice and rich chocolate great to treat yourself with. The pearl in the middle is so decadent. The waffle on the outside gives this treat a nice crunch."

"""Sleep Yourself Beautiful"" is a very very well thought out book. Not only does it give well informed information as to why sleep is important, but it also is a guaranteed hit. It tells you in detail, why sleep is so important. As well as also let you in on a few secrets as to why sleep will actually make you LOOK and FEEL better as a whole.The book goes into great detail about how the term ""beauty sleep"" is not just a random catch-phrase. It is a real thing. With health as the prime concern here, it tells you that sleep is necessary if you want to actually look attractive.My favorite chapter in the book was the chapter ""What Are The Sleep Triggers"" where it actually tells you what the body needs to fall asleep. Coming from a guy with diagnosed sleep issues, this actually hit close to home. We have all had those nights where you simply can't fall asleep, and this chapter actually goes into great detail about how to practically force your body asleep.I write all of this to say, this book is QUALITY. If you are having trouble sleeping, maybe you have been struggling with how your body looks lately, this will give you the confidence that it really is a simple fix, and once you are getting the right amount of healthy sleep, you will not only LOOK great, but you will also be 1000% healthier and might even extend your life!"

"Im using it right now to type! Its great. Windows 8 is stupid feels more like im using a phone and Ive caught myself trying to use the screen as a touch lol but overall its nicely built, works well and is really cute. I would recommend for a younger crowd and those who dont want much memory as I have used most of mine in less then a month! But I have alot of songs, apps, movies etc..."
"Excellent! True to size I'm size 4 I ordered a medium because my hips are wide and my backside isn't small it fits perfectly. The quality is surprisingly great I expected some loose threads but it was perfect! Shipping was fast too. The top part is great because the straps are wide enough for fuller chested women and the bottom is tight but stretchy so it sucks in all the right places! Hope this helped. Don't hesitate to purchase!"
"This was a great read, albeit the theory became a little complex toward the end. It was great to see historial truths blended into the story to add a taste of reality (albeit more of an entree that the main course!)"

"This twisted collection of several creepy horror stories made for a good evening's entertainment. Each story is well written and evocative, with some being more complex than others. One stand out story for me is Jacob's Gift, a very Twilight Zone-esque tale about a young man with special powers. I also liked Rest Stop. I could thoroughly feel the woman's apprehension then terror, and the ending is very effective. My favorite is Code Blue, an emotional story with effective twists and a satisfying ending. Quick and sometimes highly original, these stories make for a fun, worthwhile read."
"love it. It sounds gr8. It shipped right away.  It was a gift for my wife. She loves it. It made her happy so it makes me happy"

"This is the second time buying off of Amazon.  Not the greatest so far.  I ordered these protector covers for my galaxy S2 per the picture, description, and customer comments and reviews of this seller.  I got these in an envelope not in any kind of packaging.  Immediately I saw they were not the right ones.  They are not what the picture looks like.  The pic has 2 cutouts at the top for the camera and the sound and this has one long cutout for both.  Plus these are way too small.  They don't cover the whole screen at all.  I have set up a return hoping they will send me the right ones.  I really don't care about the refund I just want the right covers.  I will mail back tomorrow and follow up with a post of what happened.  Had to pay my own postage for return also.  Pretty cheap for their error."

"I love this item. I'm still working on it. It is not a simple design, not for the beginner. You must have patience as it takes awhile to do. I think once I'm done and have it framed it will be an heirloom with our 10 grandchildren's names on it."

I have had it for just short of a year now, and it still works as good as it did the day I got it."
"I got this knife for my girlfriend on Sept 20th 2013.. Today is March 5th 2014 and its still holding up.. she has it on her key chain and uses it everyday. Its blade is still as sharp as the day we got it.. the only complaint I have is that I bought a gold one and now months later, the gold rubbed off so it is silver now... But 5 stars!!! It's great"
"Received the watch on time. Packed perfectly. Absolutely stunning watch and I have owned everything from Rolex to Breitling. Hamilton delivered on this pilot watch. The case, movement and dial are excellent. The band was a tad short (I have 8 1/4"" wrist so that's why). Common problem for me. Anyone with a 7 1/2 wrist the band length will be perfect. Don't hesitate to buy this watch. I was looking at IWC, Ball and this was the perfect choice. I went to our local mall and tried them all on and this watch looks more expensive and has more presence than either of the other two I was considering. This was a decision on style and not driven by finances. I am so thrilled I picked the Hamilton."

"It really does everything that it is supposed to do but the hook will not close for me. I have had everyone I know try to get it to lock together but it is about 1/2&amp;#34; out of place. Other than that inconvenience I have really loved the curlers.Oh yeah, they are not comfortable to sleep on so use a hooded dryer or make this a day project because it was one of the worst nights' sleep I have ever had."

Cuba is great in the part and the dogs are hilarious. I got a copy for myself and a copy for my friend who also was searching for it."
"The only place my dad could find this item was a half an hour drive. He is 88 so that isn't realistic.. He was so impressed that just like that we had his product."
"Perfect for a light, easy read. Interesting characters in a  delightful situation that the author resolves in an really believable way."
"Received this order fast. Tried it once so far, for a 10 minute stand up tan and I could tell right away I was darker. The smell is amazing and didn't make my skin greasy or dried out. I will keep using it and probably order another bottle once this one is done."
"it takes quite long to arrive (app. a month by the time I ordered). However, it comes in a packet of 3 which is a very good deal. highly recommend if you are not in hurry for the product."

"I thought this would be a perfect piece for our new nursery. When the item arrived and we began assembling it, we realized that the top two shelves were broken and the bottom one damaged. It is such a hassle as we now have to return this and look for another that matches with the rest of the nursery furniture. I guess you get what you pay for."
"this game is so awesome. I love playing it. I was confused at first on how to play the game but now that I have it down pack, I can't stop playing it. I will recommend this game to everyone."
"I've taken apart 2 iPods so far. It's been good to me. I would recommend it for sure!Price is good."

"I wrote a wonderful review when I received these shoes yesterday, they are really comfortable and cute, but today is day 2 of wearing them (for a total of about 5 hours) and the fabric that meets the heel on both shoes has started to tear and wear away due to friction on the pavement. The sole of the shoe ends about a quarter of an inch too soon, which forces the fabric right above the heel of the shoe to meet the floor when your heel touches the ground. Its too bad there is no option here to include a photo. These are not going to last very long. Buyer beware."
"This is one great burr grinder.  It is compact but holds a large amount of grounds, is built solid and compared to other well known brands I have owned is much quieter and less messy.  I give this one a 10 plus!"
"I feel this book really captured the perspective Claudia had of things and it helps us understand her actions better.  The story is very complete, though you will be able to enjoy it better if you read &amp;#34; Interview with the vampire.&amp;#34; It is however not necessary."
"A well written book on the nation of Israel and how GOD is sending advance warnings of things to come."

"I love mixing supernatural with good humor.  The only reason I put four stars instead of five is I had a hard time believing the logistics of the story.  Most of that is personal opinion but it was a mark against the book in my eyes."
"I came across this book quite by accident and loved every word.  I'm also a pet person so Clive particularly made me smile."
"Good price for what I needed. Still had to purchase new bearings, but it was better than buying an 8 pack of wheels I didn't need."
"I have always loved Tim Conway!!!! Some of my favorite childhood memories are of sitting in the living room,with my grandparents, on Saturday nights, waiting to see what he, and Harvey Korman would do on the Carol Burnett show that week. Even as a little girl, I thought Tim Conway was hysterical!!!! Still do!!!! Whether I'm watching an interview with him, watching the DVDS of the Carol Burnett Show, or reading this book, he makes me laugh so hard, for days my stomach muscles feel like I've done a thousand sit-ups!!! I am glad I bought this book on my Kindle because now, I'll own it forever, and it won't fall apart when I've read it a thousand times!!! Highly recommend it!!!!!! Wish I could've given it 5,000 stars!!!!!!"
"GOOD! I wish you could not pay as much tax for importing it.  it was never like this before really."

"Got it to have an extra battery when your out all day. I am very happy with the quality and price of this battery. Canon brand might have a bit more capacity, but not proportional to the premium price. I for one do not think brand name accessories are essential or needed."

"Higman aims to provide a succinct and abridged history of the Caribbean to a general audience, from pre-Columbian times to the present. Acknowledging first the problems that confront any attempt at coherently defining &amp;#8220;the Caribbean,&amp;#8221; he limits his survey to the island societies of Spanish, Dutch, French, and English heritage, omitting such territories as Florida or the Guyanas.Higman organizes the matter chronologically, starting with a synopsis of the region&amp;#8217;s formative and ongoing geological activity and a brief biogeography. Maps and graphics of prehistoric Ta&amp;iacute;no artifacts are used to help illustrate this &amp;#8220;ancient archipelago.&amp;#8221; Columbus&amp;#8217;s four journeys to the Caribbean introduce consequences of culture-contact and prepare for environmental, economic, and social transformations that become more apparent at the end of the &amp;#8220;second sixteenth century&amp;#8221; (1530-1630). Slavery and its ends on plantations, backed with some demographic considerations, ground Higman&amp;#8217;s brief primer on the two prevailing models of framing the Caribbean &amp;#8211; plural or creole societies. Higman also traces developments from abolition to the present, using the events from the English Caribbean as a guidepost, but notes important departures in the stories of Cuba and Haiti, respectively.This nooks-and-crannies book is a fine reference textbook, and appears to streamline current opinion on the state of research on the region well &amp;#8211; it is a friendly and intelligent digest. Its deliberate omission of in-text documentation, however, is frustrating. Finally, the absence of both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda is puzzling, considering the former&amp;#8217;s proximity to Jamaica and the latter&amp;#8217;s resemblance in form and function to the ABC islands of the Dutch."
"My Frabosk plate worked OK for a while, but after a few month it started to do some crack-like noises.Then it lost its flatness, and assumed a curbed shape.Finally its three metal layers started to come visibly apart.In the long run, you may spend less and have far better results, buying a few induction pots and pans at IKEA."
"Some of my baby skins areas like knees , arm pits were getting blackened due to crawling and other fun activities , we bought these mitts to clean those body areas , Those helped but not fully . my baby plays with while bathing. So it didnt serve the purpose fully but , its okay kind of product ."
"Sent using only bubble wrap envelope.  Product was cracked, prongs bent and foreign matter inside jiggled when shaken.  I don't know if product was just sent in poor packaging or also if it was manufactured poorly....maybe both! Product sold by affiliated vendor, Jane Cheung."
"Nice, quick way to get videos. My nephew was able to use it on his new Siberian Husky. It's his first dog, so I wanted him to get started on the right foot."
"A good series of movies. I've been a John Wayne Fan for a long time. &amp;#34;In Harm's Way was initially difficult to find . Glad Amazon had it!"
"It wasnt for my phone even tho it said it was....it was a waste of time ordering but I ended up sellin it in tha hood for more than I paid for it"
"If you follow True Blood, Twilight or any other pop culture vampire stories and do not take the time to read Dracula you should be ashamed.The story dragged a bit towards the end but still a must read."

"I love this series it is great cant wait to read the newest book. Thank Kate McMullan for such an amazing book and series."
"With characters that the readers can relate to and relationships that feel reminiscent of our own lives, Stay offers an intriguing and steamy story about navigating love and life, never missing a detail about the pinnacles and pitfalls and everything in between.  You won't want to put it down and will be on the edge of you seat waiting for the next one!"
"We purchased a similar folding potty seat before this one (with cushion), but it was so unstable and made my daughter scared of sitting on adult toilet.This one is so perfect!It has non slip rubber on the base so it doesn't move and she has handle to hold on to so that she won't touch the dirty public toilet.I always bring a disinfectant wipe so i can wipe the seat after she's done.When folded, they are both similar in size although maybe this one is a bit longer but its thinner because it has no cushion.I like this seat better than the cushioned-version one, hands down."
"I'm looking to get a cheap retractable razor to open packages because i'm not strong enough (like my husband) to just rip the packages/carton boxes open.It works well, the blade is so sharp and i can just snap the tip if it gets dull.For a set of 3 knife set, the price is good too.Overall i'm happy with this purchase."
"This cleansing cloths hurt my eyes, when i tried to remove my eye makeup it stinks my eyes!I won't be buying any olay wet wipes anymore. I tried the Olay regenerist micro-exfoliating wet too and it also hurt my eyes.I prefer neutrogena wipes, they're gentler in removing my eye makeup."
"The brush has a very strong plastic smell when it first came, the smell stayed on my daughter hair when i used it. So gross.I cleaned it with mild soap and water. The smell is still there but bearable after a day.My daughter's hair is very fine, frizzy and tangled all the time. Even sitting for a few minutes on her car seat makes her hair frizz and in knots.The brush works well and she's not in pain.I need to stroke more to untangle her hair because the bristle is shorter and reach less hair than other ""traditional"" brush.This brush comes in a mirror-like blue and very nice. My daughter loves it.I love this brush, i wish it doesn't have that plastic smell."
"I bought this for my daughter's bed. We are currently potty training her.At first it smells like plastic but I air it out for a few days and the smell is gone.The top part is terry cloth and the other side is plastic material.It doesn't make any crinkle sound when she sleeps on it, so it doesn't bother her sleep.She wet her bed once and i didn't change the bed right away because i have to clean her up.The urine didn't leak. It is waterproof.All in all, we love this mattress protector."
"My daughter loves how she can lean back because sometimes she needs so sit for a long time ;)There's handles on both sides for gripping if you child is afraid of &amp;#34;falling&amp;#34; and the front cover keeps urine from going everywhereI fits both round and oval toilet."
"Siguiendo la saga,  es muy buena, nos cierra la historia con la vida de.Lucy, entretenida y rom&amp;aacute;ntica....me encant&amp;oacute; seguir la vida de todos estos.personajes! Recomendable!"
"Great price and the same product Home Depot sells for this at 1/3 less price. I am happy with this product."
"I like it and it doesn't jam up like my previous one. I feel a little safer than before I got this."
"I read the reviews for these candles before I purchased them, and was very happy with this product!  I got the last 3 that were available, and now wish I had ordered enough for all our windows.  I was a little skeptical of battery operated candles since I had others in the past where the batteries only lasted a few days at the most.  The candles performed beautifully...stayed on from dusk until dawn from the day I put them out until I took them down a few days after Christmas (15 days).  I put all the batteries in them at the same time, and made sure to follow the directions so that the on/off sensor was facing out.  I also liked that you can choose between a solid light or flickering or off.  I used the flickering glow since we live in an old farmhouse, and they looked just like candles burning in the window!.  We didn't have any other outside lights to combat the nice light from the candles.  The light is abit dim, so if you're looking for something bright white like most Christmas lights, you might not like these, but I loved them! t I took the batteries out when I packed them away until next year to avoid something switching them back on while they're in storage.  I sent the company a message to let me know when more are in stock.  Hope these become available again!"
"I would recommend this Book to everyone, simple recipes with no &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; ingredients!!!I'm ready for more books like this one."
"I 'm satisfy with this product . It is exactly of the description that amazon does.  It is a good product."
"These helped a ton! Was able to pump a lot more a lot faster. Made it fit so much better too. Better fit=less/no pain and less time attached to the pump."
"I like this diaper cover. I'm not sure it would have fit her at 4lbs, but it fits around 7lbs for sure, which is why I just give it 4 stars. My daughter has itty bitty chicken legs and is very long and skinny, so I think that is why it didn't fit quite right at first. I love that the aplix tabs overlap. The snap versions of this diaper, which we also have, don't fit quite as well since they don't overlap at the waist. It's adorable on babies. Gives them a larger bottom so we had to go up to 0-3 instead of newborn clothes when she wears these diapers. It holds everything in, unlike the disposables. Definitely recommend this diaper for those first few months before the one size diapers fit!"
"I love this seat. We chose it for how sturdy it looks and is, cute factor (cow print) was a bonus, and the height/weight limit. This car seat not only looks sturdy, it feels sturdy. It supports my daughter's head well and the plastic isn't flimsy. She falls asleep right away in it too. We didn't use the infant foam as our daughter fit better without it, even with her birth weight at 6lb 8oz and 20.5"" long. It fits in our 1999 Subaru forester in a side position with the base, but the front seat has to be all the way forward and that makes it so no one can sit up there. It fits in the middle back seat without the base. It also fits exceptionally well in our 2002 dodge ram quad cab. We don't have the latch system in our vehicles, so we use the seat belt to install it. Not hard at all. Just have to push the base down and get it tight enough. I highly recommend this seat if you are searching for one. It's not overly heavy and bulky. It's bigger than others, but it's also sturdier. It's definitely not too heavy (I'm only 5'3"", 120lbs and I can carry it easily)."
"May end up returning. Battery only lasted about 20 minutes the first time we unplugged it after being plugged in about 36 hours. The sound and picture are kinda weird too. We also don't like that it shuts off the video after 4 minutes when run on battery. It still has sound, but you have to push a button to get the video back for another 4 minutes. We bought this because we needed a second monitor for the new baby and liked the idea of the pan/tilt from the parent control. The pan/tilt is great. We really like that. I wish that the Infant Optics monitor had that option. We have the Infant Optics DXR-5 for our other kid and prefer that one over this. If we return it, we will get a second Infant Optics and just have to have 2 hand consoles to watch each kid in their rooms so that we can have constant coverage of both rooms."
"seemed like a long weight but so worth it more power and longer flights than stock just had to adjust trim manually with the rotor to swash plate tie rod which is very easy because these batterys are a little longer and heavier than stock  and your heli will drift  backwards"
"Just got today. Has AMAZING quality to it. Let me start out by saying that it arrived very very quickly, and in perfect boxing. Took it out to find an owners manual and the product. Very easy and simple to connect blue-tooth keyboard. Ipad snaps right in place easy with no hassle. Provides great protection for it and definitely would look forward to getting another one of New Trent's items. 5 stars all the way. Keyboard seems a little small for my hands, but im sure i will adjust quite easily.Bottom line.Amazing quality for an amazing price"
"This has served just as I was told it would. I can talk with out having to touch my phone or the Bluetooth."
"Not really sure how well it worked....i used it as more of a precaution than anything.Might work! Not sure"
"This was the third one I've purchased. All three have broken and have awful static. Bought the others for my family members thinking it would be a good gift and they too threw theirs out"
"I couldnt find this tea anywhere after being able to buy it at the supermarket, so i had to get it off here. Really nice flavor"
"I bought this shelf to tie my bathroom together! Easy to put together. A little flimsy though, but overall cute"
"Bought this. Inflated it. After 2 days is was deflated. I think it was shipped to me with a hole it. I made absolute sure the white plug was properly installed in the hole it belonged in. Threw it in the trash, it was wasted money and patience on the shipping."
"I used this in conjunction with &amp;#34;Sweet Sweat&amp;#34; today during my workout, great combination!My product came early and in the exact form I assumed."
"Great product! I am impressed. I bought it to protect my cigarettes while I am on patrol, and it does just that! hard plastic case can withstand a 200lb Marine laying on it in full battle-gear. The dispenser is easy to fill and easy to utilize. The only con is that it does not come with lighter fluid. Great buy nonetheless!"
"Works on my laptop, but i am just waiting to be able to play my game with it. Great to play my n64 emulator with though!"
"i have bought other throwing knives before, but these take the cake. the best ones i have ever bought. between 6 Marines throwing them literally all day, after about a week one has finally broken. But the others are still in great shape!"
"its just what i needed to sharpen all my knives, the three sharpeners are very durable and it gets the job done."
"I got this item several days early, which is good, now i can test it out on a patrol tomorrow. plenty of space, and many handles to grab it from. great buy"
"They are a great replacement for my old favorite jeans!  I will need to order again - this is just too time consuming for me."
"....my Kids need to download and use for they own inters.  They are great readers and Internet users...  It frees up my iPad!"
"I agree with all of the other 5 star reviews!  I did think that this would replace my need for a moisturizer.  However, it wasn't enough on its own.  I still use a daily moisturizer before I use Miracle skin.  I've used clinique, mac, bare essentials, cover girl, etc.  This is by far my favorite that I have used.  It is a light coverage and the reviews were correct you need to go a shade darker than you normally would."
"Very good  kept my  interest all through  the book  I especially like the settings as I was in southeast Asia"
"A DOOR UNLOCKED IS A WELL WRITTEN STORY TO RECUSE A CHILD WHO HAS BEEN ADUCTED BY BOBBY RAY BEFORE IT TO LATE I ENJOY READING CLAVIN DEAN BOOKS"

"ThanksLove the Mag. Will look into getting a few more magazine in the near future. Amazon has always done me well. Thx again."
"One of the best books on the subject of Elvis Presley collectible memorabilia.This book by Sean O'Neal will be forever a high standard for others to follow."
"This is great fun!!! I chose it to brighten my day @ the office. I would ask it silly or serious questions, and get a laugh out of the answers, wich are weirdly mostly spot on. Everybody coming in to my office picks it up just to have a laugh.It's the first time that I have seen one, so I cannot compare to any other objects.I can reccomend this for old &amp; young, everybody who has a sense of fun."
"It is most certainly a celebration. This book makes a great gift for those interested in New Mexico. Not necessarily a critical view but nonetheless worthwhile."
"This stroller totally met my expectations for subway travel with my 35 lb. beagle. Easy carry on stairs when needed. Folds easily for home storage. Lower tray for supplies is lovely!"

I ordered and it is just amazing ;) My face is radiant and there's always people asking me for my secret jaja, I always say: Aloe vera, milk soap and argan oil :)"
"The price is unbeatable. The quality is good. The colors are fun. It works great in a,most any device, I have an IPAD, my sisters has an IPHonE, my boyfriend an Asus Transformer and I also have an LG Optimus black.... All ofnghem work fine in every device"
"My boyfriend gave me this as my engagment ring and it is just beautiful. It is different, original and romantic. I just love the color and the shape. It is just perfect :D"
"These were just what I expected! Awesome sturdy, stiffer leather that I know will get better with age and last for years with proper care. These might seem like they run narrow at first, but this is due to the quality of the leather which will give over time. The fit is a bit shallow over the fore-foot and toe. The lack of volume here may make using an additional full insole uncomfortable, however a 3/4 insole works just fine and doesn't cramp the toes. I wear a US 7.5 or an 8 and the Euro 38 was a perfect fit. I reccomend waterproofing with a wax based product like Sno-seal or a similar product made by Dr. Marten. Also, conditioning from time to time will help keep the leather supple. I had been wanting to try a pair of Kickers for years and am glad I finally did!"
"When I saw the release for The Bones of Others, I had recently finished reading the Evil Trilogy (which by the way, was fabulous, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire series) The name sold me and Vickie didn't let me down.  This was a great story with plenty of action suspense and romance. So excited for the next one!!!!"
"Such a great book! I couldn't put it down! Jaycee Clark gives meaning to the word thriller.  She has a way with words and characters that she keeps you completely engrossedits rough the entire story. I would LOVE to see a sequel ........ Or two, or three.........."
"I HIGHLY Recommend this wonderfully written book. Be it through a book or electronic. So well written and truly helps you see things in a different manner. I recently lost my hero, my father, and this has helped to heal some of my pain. I love James Van Praagh and Doreen Virtue shines bright also. Do Not be fooled by this size. It packs a punch and a bunch of helpfulness on each and every page. Many hugs to all. Much Love and Light."
"So glad i bought this season One, when I got the season two. I almost didn't, thinking, ahhh, I have seen it years ago. Well, little did i realize, how much I had forgotten of the show.

Loved the show, and still do. Glad to revisit this series. HIGHLY Recommend seller too., an Honest, Reliable, seller. Quick ship."

I will wrap up a gift card in one, and tickets for a special gift somewhere for him (surprise) in another. Absolutely lovely, the way the map is &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; tattooed into the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; and looks so realistic. A must have for any Pirates fan, or collectible for a nice way to give a gift it. HIGHLY Recommend this lovely item."

"WASTE OF MONEY! Did not work!!!!! I am doing better not taking this and just being careful with what I eat and the amount I eat. WASTE of Money!"
"I bought this for a little girl after seening it on tv. It looked like it was going to be really awsome gift for a 7 year old.... When we started to play with the makeover mirror it was slow and kinda difficult to understand what to do and what all you could do with the product... Over all the 7 years was not excited about this. And I also think it is way over priced!"
"Do not try to connect anything other than a PS3 or Xbox360 controller, like i did. I bought this intending to use a Logitech F310 controller with Xbox thinking than if it regularly works with PS3 than it must work with Xbox using this adapter, as it must convert any PS3 operating controller into a Xbox controller, right? Wrong!"
"I did expect that there would be something included to allow you to track progress - but there isn't.  You can draw on it."

"Another perspective on life after death, or more appropriately, the true reality of what always is present.  An interesting approach of writing what was happening to his body while his consciousness was in another place.  Whether you agree of disagree with his vision, it is a unique possibility that lends itself to the expanding field of direct experiencing a deeper reality."
"Simply one of the most engaging, well-done series ever.  Hits the ground running with great scripts and actors.  Just a great series."
"The description says the toy is 8&amp;#34; but when i measured it, it only had 5&amp;#34; that was insertable. Other than the size issue I enjoy the toy."
"The suit was very reasonably priced and when I received it, the quality was so much more than I was expecting! I will be order more swimsuits from this company! (Only drawback was the lengthy shipping time...but it was worth the wait!)"
"This was a really good story. I truly enjoyed this book. If you have a cat you can relate very well."
"The company fulfilled and shipped my order within a matter of days.. I am very pleased with how quickly I received my order and not to mention how delicious the nuts were.. Just placed my second order tonight.. Can't wait for round 2.."
"This product worked miracles on my face.. I had the worst case of acne..(hormonal/stress) I used it once, and it cleared up my face immediate.. Without irriting or over drying my skin.. I wish they sold this product in the local stores, I would stock up on them without a dout... Well worth the MONEY!!!"
"The set's appearance and surface detail are very handsome, but the clothe material is very light-weight and the adjustment straps do not keep vest fitted.  Still, with a little light alteration, it was just perfect for my son's junior prom."
"Love these boots! They are so comfortable and look great with jeans. Only wish I could find them in brown!!"
"I found it short but fun. My kids love it. It's helping my 6 year old with groupings and common items."
"Crossword puzzles get boring after a bit, over and over repeats. Nit to mention it never changes. Down, across. This gives a different level of difficulty. From my children to my parents mind boggling fun (4-68)"
"Shipped in a good time in great packaging and the product was in great shape and works perfectly couldn't ask for more."
"i was unsatisfied, didnt fit my phone. disapointed but it was very cheap priced so its not a big deal"
"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and I thought he was going to cry when he opened it (no worries, he didn't actually cry). He now plays it in loop in his apartment...a great man gift!"
"my pump is used today and works hard does a superior job no problems and it's cold here and the pool is closed rain needs pumping"
"great real leather, looks great when it gets the worn look. ordered two. love it. i need more words. lol"
"Best product ever!!!  Especially the Apple Cinnamon.  They used to sell it in a vitamin outlet close to where I live, but they stopped so now I have to get it online.  They still sell vanilla, but I don't care for it.  I had a severe traumatic brain injury and it seems like Alive is the only product that I have ever found that keeps my blood sugar level stable.  It is my breakfast and keeps me satiated most of the day."
"Love this product, especially the curved brush and the fact it is rich Black.  No complaints regarding this product that I always use."
"Great."
"This products doesn't work at all.  Waste of money.  Never buy this products.  Disappointed with this products. a a a"
"Beautiful chic comfortable shoe but a too big.  I was very disappointed because would really like a pair in my size. Returning."
"The otter box was in horrible condition.  The rubber was not right in it, the screen protected was scratched all up.  The camp pattern on the back began peeling off immediately.  I would have returned the junk but I can't find it so I'll just have to settle for not ordering anything from you again."
"First Nicholas sparks novel I've read, it captivated me and made me a fan. I will be reading the rest if his books now. This was so touching."
"Besides the fact that it pink and pretty it is also very protective and every time I drop my phone this case never comes off and my phone is never broken. My phone still looks like new thanks to this case!"
"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, writing, and acting. I hope the &amp;#34;retirees&amp;#34; are around for a long time. When they retire from acting, they will be much missed."
"Couldn't ask for more its been a big help in understanding the reasons for the concepts of calculus. You will pass if you buy it"
"Like it alot am very satisfied I enjoy its stylish appeal and will purchase again.very well priced compared to competitors"
"Well I'm using it to review my purchase and it's really great, I had an ipad and for the price the ipad can do it all but this is a comparable alternative. My only negative mark would be the availability of any really cool or useful apps in the &amp;#34;blackberry world&amp;#34; they have all the basic must haves, it works well for the person on the go or Mr.business man, and the kid trying to show up his friends at school. You should definitely consider this tablet when shopping for one, it will surprise you."
"Comes in very handy for charging phone,tablet, or ipod. Very useful for the car or on the go, works even without a plugin and that's very cool too."
"The cover is not bad it's not the most effective case you could buy. It's more for show and use it for that purpose only."
"works great came quickly it was excatly what i was looking for.will order from in the future. price was exactly what i was looking for color was pretty awesome despite the unclean picture of it on the net."
"The case is a very durable case and is worth every penny. It's a little bigger than most of the cases I have purchased..."
"I went through all the questions with my husband and we had a great time working together to answer the questions.It was GREAT fun."
"This has a special meaning to me due to being part Scottish and having been in Scotland a few years ago.  I think this is really beautiful !"
"I've been a Roger Hodgson fan for many years and have been faithfully seeing his concerts every time he tours the US. When Roger is off touring on another continent and I have the need to feel his live experience this is the CD I turn to. The audio is masterfully mixed and very rich with full tones. The suspense builds with the cheers of the crowd on the opening track of Take the Long Way Home all the way through to the close of It's Raining Again with the satisfied roars of the audience.Just as he does in his shows, as soon as Roger starts to play and sing, you are grasped, reeled in for a very special and magical adventure. His voice just simply soars....  Impeccable musicianship and I can very easily say these tracks are stronger than the original album versions. You can just feel his music, through and through.The set list is perfect - one moving song after another, songs varying our many feelings of profound joy, earnest longing, breathtaking wonder and fervent ""seeking"" -1. Take The Long Way Home2. Give A Little Bit4. Breakfast In America5. Only Because Of You/ Lord Is It Mine?6. The Logical Song7. School8. Dreamer9. Two Of Us10. It's Raining AgainWith the empty silence after the close of another fantastic musical journey, I ask myself where have I been? Was it just a dream? :)"
"I really love the lab coat. It is very feminine, fits like I expected it too and looks great on me!"
"I can't at this time think of the names of all the songs by Waylon I like, but there are many. I like the few I bought on Amazon, but my favorite of the three is, Anita, You're Dreaming. He was one of the greatest; his singing buddies knew that too."
"Must have for breast feeding. Positions baby perfectly and saves mom from back pain. Don't waste your money on anything else."
"Everyone I know has one.  I am very satisfied with mine and would recommend it to anyone looking for one"
"TOTAL waste of money to buy this product. It's very cheap and doesn't seem to work well on ANY device!! DO NOT PURCHASE!!!"
"Final Vow is a GREAT finish to the series! Kathleen Brooks has made a fan for life. Ahmed and Bridget's story was the icing in the cake. I am sad that this series had to end."
"The pie dish is a little big when i saw it the first time. Because of the size I didn't use it to make pies. Instead, I've used it to make baked shrimp and roast chicken! So far so good. The color is pretty too!*****I feel that the dotted rim makes it a little hard to clean after roasting chicken in it**** My solution is to put aluminum foil around the rim PRIOR to putting anything in the pan. This way when it's time to clean up, simply remove the foil and then u don't have to do any work on the rim!Side note, stoneware cools down much faster than cast iron. So don't expect your food to remain hot 30 min after it's out of the oven. I have a le creuset cast iron and food remains hot after an hour outside the oven!"
"This costume is so cute. It actually looks like the picture. If your rough with clothes this might not be for you because it's not delicate, but it's not too tough either so if you pull on it too hard it will rip. The medium fit me perfectly and I'm about 5'2"". It also comes with everything it says it does. I absolutely adore it!!!"
"I would definitely order from this company again. The product arrived before expected which was great, and it was well made. It also gives full protection of the Ipod and is really soft which is awesome. Personally I love it! The only warning I could give is that one the bow wasn't blue it was like a purple (but it was still cute) and two it was a little bit big for the Ipod especially around the button on the top of the ipod. I wish there were more cases like this one for the Ipod."
"Great plot development,characters' are wonderful as always there isa combination of joy and heartache.I am so anxiously awaiting season 4,so exited"
"This book seemed to start off good...but I just had a real problem with the characters. The sex scenes were just as good as book one...if not better.  It was something with those characters that I just didn't like this time around.  Once I got  in I read the last chapter because I didn't want to invest too much time into these characters.  While it was OK...it had the potential to be so much better.  I think Book II was the darker version of the, oh so sweet Book I."
"If you like heart racing, tense, can't put it down kind of books you will love this! I started reading and immediately I knew I wasn't getting much work done until I finished through the book, it was too good. It had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails one minute, laughing out loud the next, and crying another.I  love that the book brings up the point that sex trafficking isn't something that simply happens in a foreign country, it's something that happens every day in the United States, and in places you think it might not happen.Being a full time student, working full time and having a family, I dont get a lot of time to read, however over the summer I will be reading the rest of the Pastor Butch (main character) books!"
"Listen... I've owned over ten headsets besides this one since I initially purchased this one a while back. It has survived most of my 4 year old's life span and he has abused it more than the a public toilet at a buffet during half price hour. I now have a daughter and I have no doubt it will survive her as well.Buy one, and have it in case you are like me and blow through head sets for stupid reasons all the time."
"Pros:Its comfortablelooks goodThe sound quality is good when its working.Cons:The audio jack had to be twisted to make a good connection in several of my devices. It is apparent that it doesn't work well.The microphone jack simply doesn't work. it worked for about three minutes then became unusable. My friends and my tests have shown that when plugged in they cannot hear me, instead they hear a banshee giving birth to conjoined twins.I have serious doubts that there is an actual microphone in the headset, because the sound control also has what appears to be an inline microphone. That sounds like false advertising to me, but I'd have to take it apart to find out.I will update this after I take it apart, because if it is only cosmetic I don't need it there.In the end I think this headset was a bad attempt at a good design."
"Looking New Received UsedDid Not Match What I Was Looking Accepting Led Hand Held Did Not Run With Quick Book Program Small Label Hard To Red"
"GREAT MUSICAL TOY FOR BABY TO HOLD AND LISTEN TO.MUSIC NOT TOO LOUD AND EASY TO HOLD ON TOO."
"Love it.  Looking forward to the complete Bible. I will be revising my critique' at a later date. Thank you for embarking on this adventure so I can be blessed."
"I truly enjoy the language of this Tannkh.  It adds spice to the word of God. It is different from the KJV, a great translation also. I would encourage anyone to experience the Tannkh. Thanks you for providing this word of God."
"I will be purchasing more Nannette clothing. This 3 piece outfit is extremely soft, warm, ridiculously cute, and also extremely cool looking. I can't wait for my little rockstar to open this on Christmas. He usually does not care about opening clothes being only 3 but I just know he will love this hat. I absolutely suggest any of their clothing as a must purchase."
"It was good reading this again, refreshing the concept that we need to be independent and individuals. That the power of the I must not be diminished and subverted by the ""we."" Living our lives as we choose, not how the majority want us to live. Enjoy this short novella."
"I like how it fills in some of Bond's backstory. Tells the beginning of our favorite characters and our icons."
"Neat short novel about the joint efforts of the Allies, mostly American 2nd Cavalry and the Nazis to save the famous Austrian White horses..the Lipizzaner from the approaching Russian Army during the late days of World War II. Enjoy!"
"Great game to occupy the brain. I play it to calm my mind. Takes me back to when I was a kid."
"Quint essential Palahniuk in every sense. Funny interesting absurd filled with outlandish characters and storyline recommend to everyone who enjoys this author."
"One of the better apocalyptic/post apocalyptic books I've come across. Definitely intend on reading the next two books in the trilogy."
"I really enjoyed this book. It's creative, fabulous, magic and I identified me with this book!Also it inspired me to do things and fight for my dreams and never surrender."
"It holds my iPhone 4S with a defender case on the phone . And protects it at the same time. I'm happy with it and that's all that matters."
"we look forward to each episode, and buy them as soon as they come out. Never have to worry about what the content will be, we only have to worry about our 150lb bull mastiff jumping on us because we are laughing so hard. He wants in on the fun...I did have him worried when I was crying from laughing at bumblebees tuna, but I think even the dog found that episode hysterical!"
"I purchased this playset for my grandkids.  I need to move it around the yard when the lawn people mow.  It falls apart when you move it."
"I love it.  Got exactly what I was looking for and my niece is already looking forward to Christmas to share it with her 2 year old daughter."
"This short story is great, short but filled with lots of suspense. Will have you wanting more. Loved every minute of it!!!!!!!!!"
"Not really what I was expecting.The filing is not thick enough and doesn't stay where needed. Will use but not real happy with it."
"Reading Lance Larsen's poetry in ""Erasable Walls"" was a refreshing experience especially due to the current literary world being dominated by criticism and novels. Poetry is somewhat of a dying art however Lance Larsen seems to resurrect it through his vivid work. From start to finish, each poem drew me in and allowed me to see the world through a variety of perceptions. In poems like ""Lips"", it's interesting how Larsen focuses on a child's perception of adults and how the details he notices are tied to the superficiality of his mother. With descriptive language like a ""smeared"" mouth and ""wet looking and waxy"" appearance Larsen allows us to step into this child's world and a little bit into our own past. In addition to this, Larsen also illustrates the requirement of children to grow up quickly sometimes, applying adult lenses to the perceptions he creates. In ""Lips"" near the end of the poem he does this, the child describing the numerous duties and errands of his mother and then saying, ""I wanted to save all that, and her."" In ""February 1922: My Father's Conception"" the perception is reversed, an older man reflecting upon youth. As the older man sees two names chalked into a driveway (presumably done by children) he reflects ""names mapping the erasable walls of the heart."" It is this kind of in depth imagery that Larsen employs that causes his readers to not only recognize his good writing, but cause them also to reflect upon greater issues and themes throughout life. This play-on-perception is a wonderful tool that Larsen uses that really captivated me and caused me to think about the power of perception and how perception can change reality. The poetry in this book was wonderful and if anyone is truly a fan of poetry, then they shall truly enjoy the work within this book."
"no turn based battles, no whiney emo teenagers, and no spiky hair.while most JRPG's are content to simply be set in a fantasy land, yakuza breaks the mold as it is set in modern day japan. Yakuza is a great JRPG that avoids typical JRPG tropes like its the plague, as well as being realistic. set in the red light district of japan (i believe its somewhere in shinjuku or is shinjuku just renamed) called kamurocho, where yakuza reign and the police are corrupt. if you haven't played the first three you should leave this page now and buy them now before you even think about purchasing this game. Yakuza has a lot of content packed in the small town you explore, so much content it may take you several play throughs to experience it all, i have played every yakuza game several time over and i'm STILL finding lots of goodies to enjoy. this is a game that you want to take you time and simply enjoy. the only problem a lot of player will have is the sheer amount of cut scenes, although well done, it can take away from the experience because they tend to drag on for obscene amounts of time. if you thought the amount of cut scenes in MGS4 was ridiculous, this game will put you off. another thing is the fact that each game is set in the exact same place so it can feel a little old after a while, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. the money and time saved on world building is given to create new areas, like the roof tops and underground areas of yakuza 4, as well as new mini games, side quests and new small details added to the environments themselves. but if you can over look the flaws, you will find a great game that has a very rich and gratifying experience, on par with the likes of skyrim, it may not be as long or as deep as skyrim, but it is certainly the JRPG equivalent to the experience that skyrim provides while being decidedly japanese at the same time."
"I've had trouble with acne since my freshman year of high school. Over the years I've tried many different tricks and products, and not a single one has had such a stunning and prompt effect as Clearzine. I am very pleased with this product and intend on buying more. The product shipped very swiftly and I have no complaints whatsoever."
"This was a great read with lots of turning points. It's &amp;#34;one of those&amp;#34; books that you have to know what happens next."
"I really love this sticker, it was smaller than I thought but still amazing. Got here really quick! really good quality!"
"Great album and awsome DVD to go with it. If you love DMB this is a must have to the collection"
"Shins with an new electric sound...it works 100%. Couldn't stop listening to it the first 3 days i got it"
"One of the best character arcs in television history. Start to finish, Walt to Heisenberg is truly amazing to watch. Top notch storytelling!!"
"I loved this book and read it it record time for me. My favourite of the Belinda Alexandra novels. It took me to another world and it was like I knew the characters personally."
"This cleansing conditioner is amazing. My whole life I've had straight, no body hair. After using Wen, I actually have curls! I think it's because there is nothing weighing my hair down. I am totally hooked on Wen."
"With this collection, Nana's fourth book is yet another great source of insight into what goes on in the minds of the vast majority of Ghanaians in particular and Africans in general. The settings are drawn from multiple countries and cultures, but the thread that runs through is the same - we are able to laugh at ourselves in spite of the situations in which we find ourselves. Be prepared to laugh, smile, raise your eyebrows and shake your head at the same time; the mixture of humour against the backdrop of everyday reality is that potent.By the way, prepare to pull an all-nighter - this is one of those books you might find yourself quite unable to put down until you have read through right to the end. Nana has really spoken of Ghana indeed. Both thumbs up!"
"This is a very nice keyboard, construction is smooth and solid all around, many nice features and highly customizable. Perfect for Strategy and MMO players, but also useful for FPS'ers. The only downfalls is that there is no Blue LED. Instead of Red Green and Blue, theres Red Green and Amber. Also, the spacing of LED's under the keys is a we bit sparse and certain keys are a little brighter than others. Other than that, if your looking for an awesome gaming keyboard that has a great and unique look and feel, this is the one. This board most definitely beats out most $100+ boards."
"Good fit, comfortable and feels durable. provides a degree of protection from wind and water, not as much as a real deal uniform but enough for civy use."
"Best work gloves ive ever had. 6 Months of heavy use and not a scratch or tear in them. Very comfy aswell."
"These bulbs are of very high quality, no bad bulbs and the coating is the best ive ever seen. Also, the element itself looks to be red aswell. And the price is great. The only downfall is since they have that extra coating, they're not as bright as other 5watt c7 bulbs.If your not worried about brightness then this is an excellent buy."
"Very nice cable, nice thickness to it so it doesn't kink or bend, cool color, and the connectors are perfect for tight situations, and they lock in place."
"Best mouse i have ever have. Fully customizable in every way, excellent feel and comfort and incredible performance, especially with a good mouse pad. The only thing else you could ask for is more buttons, but for the current price this is a steal."
"This book was a gift so I couldn't really check it out in great detail. Anyway, I am a german living in the states and what made me buy this book and not any other one was because most of the other &amp;#34;german cookbooks&amp;#34; on amazon were written by americans inspired by german cuisine, or &amp;#34;americanized german recipes&amp;#34;.This book was written by germans living in Germany and claims itself &amp;#34;not americanized&amp;#34;!Since it was a gift I didn't really have a lot of time to check it out in great detail but briefly looking through it I think this was a good choice!"
"it works just fine on my HP Laserjet 4100TN! Will buy it again!The print is good! Nothing more to say!"
"GREAT DEAL!It is a Guitar, it comes with extra strings and a pipe (I don't use the pipe) and a bag and a strap and a pick (the pick is strange; pretty big, never saw a pick like that before) for like nothing at all.Of course the guitar is cheap and shouldn't be used for someone trying to make professional music with ultra good sound but for me, since I only play for hobby-reasons, its great.The guitar itself smelled a bit chemical when I opened the package but that was gone after 1 day. The color is good, no trips or something.Ofcourse the bag is NOT protective at all but it's good for preventing the guitar to get dusty and you can carry it around in it if you are careful and don't hit anything. The bag is just one layer of polyester but it does it's job!All the strings were fine when I got the guitar and still are (after 2 weeks). I can really suggest that ANYONE who is looking for a cheap solid guitar to play just for the reason of playing to BUY this guitar!You ain't gonna regret it!"
"First of all: I'm not a professional photographer but rather the average ""snapshot-guy"" who travels around and likes to take some picture here and then. And because of that I wanted to go just a little further than the normal iphone camera.I bought this set for $20 (super saver shipping arrived in 5 days!) and I totally love it.The lenses appear to have a good quality (no flaws,...) and the set up was fairly easy.At first I thought the macro was broken but then I found out that you have to get REALLY REALLY close to the object and then you get awesome sharp shots!the fish eye is awesome and I dont know if its really 180 degrees, but it must be pretty close. Wide Angle is fun and is great for pictures of rooms and stuff because it covers way more than the usual iphone camera. I recommend using the 8x zoom with the tripod and you get awesome pictures, but even without it you can get good shots!Also, the case fits my iphone perfectly!long story short: I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! it was so cheap but still very good!everyone who wants to go a little further than the usual iphone camera should definitely buy this! It's a lot of fun!"
"I believe this is a great ""backyard mechanic"" tool. Coming from a professional mechanic, I bought this tool for home use. I researched many different devises and price. Capability was also a big factor. Being able to download updates online is a BIG factor. The ease of use and the friendly tech support just reassured my original feeling of this tool. The amount of the capability of this tool you get makes it worth far more than the price. Then you still get the tech support on top of that! I am not only extreamly satisfied with my new toy but, YES, I would recommend this devise to anyone with intrest in home OBD2 drivetrain vehicle repairs."
"Kinda disappointed that it didn't have the chain at the end of the sword, but i didn't really care. Its not sharp at all (but the tips are) its kinda heavy too (: this is a really cool sword, it was so worth buying!"
"This may as well be the best Wii game I have ever played. It came in a wrapped package, like new. The instruction packet was included, though evidently used. No problems with the game at all it's perfect. Hard to believe people buy it for $80 when I scored it for $25 for practically the same quality."
"I love this Mic!!  Product arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  I have been using this mic in both live broadcasting on twitch tv and for My youtube video production work and have found it to be a most excellent product.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a professional grade microphone for this type of use."
"The case is gorgeous but the day I took it off the front of the case broke into half. The case is so thin."
"Too many clicks and too confusing to learn. I tried to enter every stop and it took so long.I wish I has my money back."
"Soulene is an engaging, creative and historically edifying novella. Children (of all ages) will love it: while the story traces a potentially real figure in an historically accurate context, it is no less magical for its truthfulness. Soulene, the central figure, is training to be nurse, or ""healer"" in the parlance of the story. On her travel to her schools, in England and France, she meets and offers medical help to a wounded knight (whom she will meet again under surprising circumstances), flees for her life with her two faithful dogs and a new animal friend she calls ""Horse,"" and interacts with many other engaging characters. The description of her life in the woods is engrossing, taking the reader to a captivating place which feels like something between ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Wind in the Willows."" It is also a coming of age story that echoes ""True Grit"" in the manner in which this young girl defines a task and sets out, against significant obstacles, to accomplish it. My kids are eagerly awaiting (a slightly longer) volume 2."
"What is all the hype about? This is a perfect example of &amp;#34;the emperor's new clothes:&amp;#34; there really is nothing there. There is no substantive script, and no space (sic) for real acting. The special effects are boring and vertigo-inducing: stuff keeps spinning around and Bullock's primary contribution is panting like she is in labor. The events are so far-fetched and illogical they further minimize an already minimal experience. What a disappointment. She and the movie were both nominated for oscars; somebody must have lobbied hard and long."
"Nancy Young is a born storyteller.  Her fine writing reflects the gifts of compelling characterizationand descriptive clarity enhanced by her graceful literary style.  From the beginning, the book echoesher deep respect for this hypnotic tale.  It is a must-read!"
"Tthe faucet was easy to repair in minimal time. The cartridge changed out smoothly and worked well. No more leaks!"
"The headphones had a lot of static.  I was unable to hear the other party.  The car charger work very well so far."
"Ordered this as a first laptop for my preteen. Works great but is slow. Do not put a lot on it or it will slow down"
"I arrive on time and perfect all excellent, for the birthday of my daughter seven years meet on December 19"
"This book is really and truly amazing though I put away some of the grammar mistakes but amazing I was so amused I read it in two days ugh I loved it thats why it got five stars"
"this is another great pick it has love trust happiness and knowing ones self to come to terms on who you are and just be happy."
"this was one of the worth movie that i have rent so far the cover looks interesting but the movie is bad."
"this book was different with all the different stories but each one held their own I thought that I would be disappointed after the first story but I wasn't. each one left me wanting more."
"this stony was amazing and true to the heart when love comes their is nothing you can do but accept it"
"Having payed only around $100 for this watch i was pretty pleased with what i received. The watch face is gorgeous; the color contrast is beautiful and the sub dials give the face an intricate look.  Also the size fits my wrist perfectly since i consider my forarm to be relatively big. My only dislikes are the fact that the thickness of the watch is actually it bit bigger than i imagined which makes it feel a bit bulkier than i prefer and that the buttons on the chronograph are a bit clunky (ie a bit too big and gets stuck sometimes). But all in all i'm satisfied with my purchase."
"Since the title says &amp;#34;belly button rings&amp;#34; (plural) I thought I'd be getting all five. I only received one and did not get to pick the color. The belly button ring I got is still cute, but not what I was expecting"
"I love this pitcher but I don't like the lid arrangement. The lid seals too poorly to shake the contents."
"I am a huge Buster Keaton fan and this may mot be the perfect set (it should contain Keaton plus) it is wonderful amazing set"
"What a piece of junk! Shattered after a dozen swings. I'll be switching to a maple bat next. I wonder if it will even burn properly. Waste of money."
"Le quedo excelente a mi tel&amp;eacute;fono lo cubre y lo protege donde debe proteger y deja libre lo que debe estar libre,excelente material y acabado,muy buena compra."
"Worked better than any of the three other stay-down products we have tried.  Excellent product!  We have an articulating bed, so sheets were constantly sliding up and off of the mattress.  Not so with these!"
"The Masters saga is good since it ties in the story for the Robotech series. Yes Dana's character is a scatterbrain but she isn't too serious either. I wish they would have made episodes for after the Masters and into when the Invid arrived for more detail about what happened to the Army of the Soutern Cross and the members of 15th squadron."
"Cute and clever quick read. The price was right and I enjoyed some of the witty comebacks by the protagonist. Definitely more for the 18-25 crowd, but I enjoyed it even in my old age of 37. Talented writer, I may look up some more of her work."
"This movie is fun for the whole family, perhaps a little frightening at times for the under 5 crowd. My two boys who are 5 and two love it, but always watch it with my husband or I. It is one movie that we don't groan when we have to watch."
"These are a good price and work as three season boots, similar to bogs or muck boots, however the craftsmanship is not as good as the far more expensive brands. I am not sure these will last more than a few seasons as I see a small section of rubber has come unglued to the neoprene after only a few months. It does not affect function yet, but it is probably only a matter of time. For the price I am quite satisfied with these as they have made it through 3 months of a Maine winter."
"We are using these in our small school house as a winter science project. Each child is sprouting a large jar. The kids really enjoy them as a snack and love to watch them change. They have a high ratio of sprouting beans compared to other brands we have tried, however caution is still advised when snacking or you could be out a tooth."
"The color is meh. Just meh. Not horrible, but it is olive green with a bright green fabric showing. These were comfortable right out of the box. I could tell they were very well made and will hold up well."
"Took a try at this.. and did not like and work for me...very uncomfortable, burns-stings some, smells... not worth the try!"
"Nice look, good material... took three weeks to receive the sweater for my wife (as a gift)... would order another IF had more choice of colors!!"
"I totally loved the phone, but unfortunately it was locked, but. I was looking for an unlocked phone. i am very disappointed by this situation."
"The Fisher case is a great investment of little money...to protect your bigger investment of your detector. I was very happy with my purchase the quality was great,the bad is roomy and lite weight as well."
"These cables work great, I got two of them to extend the 60ft cables that came with my Zmodo camera system. The 4-camera power splitter still works even at 110ft of cable and the signal is still good."
"This CAT5 cable works great. It was a little thicker than I thought it would be though. I got this to use with a USB extender over CAT5 for extending the USB from the computer to the servo controller circuit board for a talking Halloween skull that I made that will be outside on Halloween."
"I like the shoe but they were darker than I expected...returned and purchased the slate, which is a nice gray."
"These sandals are cute and comfortable.  I like the fact that they are affordable and made in Italy.  At first I was going to return them for a larger size ( i ordered the 7.5) but after trying them on a 2nd time, the leather stretched a little bit, so I am keeping them.  The studs are cute and give them spice.  the toe straps are comfortable and not rigid.  I highly recommend them."
"I haven't used much nail polish in my life, but this is the best I've ever tried. Lasts pretty well, dries quick, gorgeous hazy purple grey color."
"Well written with enough surprise to make me want to keep reading until I got to the end.  If I want to keep reading, and then want it to keep going when I reach the end, I consider it a good read.  I will look for the next one in the series."
"This was such a help to me this year.  I had a major illness and could not really face trying to get out to shop.  I was able to get these for family members who live a good distance away, which would have meant shopping AND shipping.  The grandkids loved them and there were plenty of items available for the parents as well.  Even better, I could deliver them via Face Book, which worked better than I ever imagined.  Great service and great idea that sure worked for me this year."
"Not Great, Pretty standard. Looks pretty cheap, pretty loud when you step onto it. Works for me though, didn't break I way 200 lbs."
"This is great! My son loves it, the sleeves are really long but we just rolled the cuff up once and it fits fine. Thanks!"
"This fit just as expected! I couldn't wait for it to come! I love it and will order another! Great deal and good service!!"
"I ordered this skirt in a medium and the length is perfect! I love it, perfect for summer coming soon!"
"I thought this would be long like in the picture but it hit right above my ankle. It is much cuter in the picture."
"I love this diaper bag its spacious and so pretty my only issue is that it has a weird smell in it thats like impossible to get rid of other then that im very glad I purchased it :)"
"It only lasts for one hour of battery juice, not cool but it does work well so far."
"Could never get it to work.  Should have returned it, but didn't take the time too.  I had purchased two talking books at the grocery store this summer and they were cheaper and worked perfectly.  In fact, my grandaughter has played them so much that they are now hidden....for her parents sanity sake!"
"One of the best headphones out there right now for this price. Buy it while its still there ! :P"
"They are roomy. Kids took all their stuff to camp easily. One bag already has a hole though, so not sure how they'll last for next year."
"it's so good.My thoughts about it are stars I can't fathom into constellations it's so good. READ THIS BOOK"
"Still trying to figure this product out. The product is ok when I really need it to work it won't we charge it every night and it will work for 1 or 2 uses, but then it fizzles out.we have a German shepherd /Rottweiler mixed so she's a pretty big dog. I couldn't wait for this item to come in and I was thrilled that it work so well at first, but like I said after the second use it didn't faze her the power was weak. We keep trying because she hates to hear the warning beep she will back off which is good I hate to do any thing to her but if she needs it I want it to work, but I can't rely on it."
"This dual charger is pretty handy. You only need 1 socket to charge 2 phones at the same time! It works perfectly on our iphones and we are really impressed with the design and functionality. We are getting an ipad mini for Christmas and hopefully it will charge that too."
"I was suicidal when I went looking for something and found these, I'm fat and now I know that eating healthy and exercising for fun are all I need, not the BS advertising companies have bribed the health industry and brainwashed stupid Joe Blow into telling me."
"Just finished reading  Christmas Grace.  Couldn't put it down.  A well written story with well defined characters and story line.  You could tell exactly what each character was feeling but you could not anticipate how the story was going to play out.  You laughed when they laughed, cried when they cried but always kept wondering what was going to happen next.  I would recommend this book to those who love a good romance or good stories about the lives of every day people."
"This book taught me imagination. I still have a copy of it and can't wait to share it with my first granddaughter."
"I like just four words very much it enhances my brain. It helps my memory. It helps me use my imagination. I'm afraid I'm going to get through the levels really quick so please work on adding more levels."
"This is fun because it combines the heel game along with the map levels like so many other games I enjoy."
"Nothing bad about it. If you like simple, and you wanna show the color if your iPod I'd buy it. Just took a little long to get it, but it's worth it. Very slim."
"I LOVE IT. First, service was amazing! I made these especially for my boyfriend and I, but I got the date wrong on my dog tags so I emailed them right away! Sure thing, they sent me another pair with the right information. Second, the company is so nice and they really do a GREAT job. I cant wait to give the dog tags to my boyfriend. Shipping is great!  YOU WONT REGRET IT!"
"We spend enough on the camera and lenses, why wouldn't you take good care of it??  Plus YouTube has wonderful videos to help you through the process."
"Great for the kids and the. Family ..... for those scary notes.  That you love too do. Onto others  on Halloween night"
"I love my new iphone case!!! It looks so pretty for, for special occassions only! More than what I expected."
"This product works for me.  The price was great.  I use it everyday.  I might order another in the future."
"My granddaughters love to play with this app. You can make your picture the way you like it. You should try this out."
"This entire book was just weird, the whole time the characters were just totally boring and just silly. I read this book at the beginning of high school thought it was weird, but a couple of years later I tried again just to be disappointed"
"I purchased the Monsoon Gearslinger as a handy pack that I could carry on short outting and in the truck as a emergency bag if need be on long road trips...and for this use it has worked well. I am a big fan of Maxpedtion and their fine line of durable and well thought out bags, backpacks and pouches of all types are fine products...I have used this pack on several short 10 mile hikes and to attend all day events like festivals, sporting events and shooting matches..it has worked well. The pack rides comfortably over your shoulder and generally stays in place, well constructed, amble pockets with many internal and external achoring points and conpartments,very quickly removed and remounted, items are easily eccessible within the intercompartment. Once again Maxpedition has not let me down...its not a perfect all purpose pack but for quick excess, short hike or day outing as well as bag to throw in the vehicle slung over the seat works very well."
"I have the medium and the large Rollypoly and use them on reqular bases, both have proven tough and convenient pouches. The roll up feature is very desirable,I believe its best feature, besides its very good construction.  I do not use the pouch very often in a traditional dump pouch function, attached to my belt or gear, but just as a compactable pouch to carry in my shooting bag to collect brass or carry gear while moving between stages in match environment.  The pouch has reinforced vents in the bottom and will stand upright by itself, if the wind is not to strong, with a few items in the bottom has no trouble with up right open use. Its sort of promoted as a dump pouch to be worn for magazine dumping, and can be used for this, though mounting variety is limited (thus only gave it 4 stars, gets 5 starts for durablilty and folding compact storage)..really, lest for me, it is just a tough, strong, well thoughtout folding, compact pouch that somehow is very useful for a variety of handy uses...in fact many many many times during events shooters ask me &amp;#34;where did you get that pouch&amp;#34; , &amp;#34;who makes that&amp;#34;  after I show them how it folds up..&amp;#34; have to get one of those, now who makes it?&amp;#34;"

"I loved reading this book and I  could put it down, i have been  there before but I was the wife"

"I was worried that this flag would come with printed stars. Nope! It has embroidered stars, which look so much better! It is so beautiful and I am thrilled with it. Thank you!"
"Fit is perfect and hoodie is good quality. Purchased for my husband (a HUGE Star Wars fan) and he loves it! My husband is 6'2&amp;#34; and muscular, and the extra large fits perfectly."
"Awesome!! This is as per my expectation. Bought it for my father and it is absolutely as shown in the picture. Nice Feeling!!"
"awesome!! it lasts and i like that it has a little shock protection from the interior silicone, b/c i can be clumsy at times. i also get complements on the design quite a bit. so thank you for adding to my style. ;-)"
"I love my new lockset. My old one had seen its best days. Shipment was fast and right on time for mypresent job."
"Got this way before they said I would. Works great on my 22lr. This is not some cheap plastic it is metal. Locks in good also."
"Tuck so long to get to my house. It was not even funny, then after waiting for so long it came in And it was broke. Very unhappy. Don't know if they are sending me another one or not. But I'm very unhappy"
"This is the funnest car and little girls with bows in their hair look great driving it.Our one year old granddaughter can't stop playing with it even if she is too small to actually drive it.Received it faster through Amazon than a local toy store."
"I love my wallet case, it's the only thing I take with me when I leave the house. Have received several compliments! :) The snap clip is perfect and I even over stuff my wallet and everything stays in place."
"They are strong and last a good while. I have shared with my husband and kids and they also enjoy it. You can also use this to treat headaches, just rub the little beadlet on your forehead, helps me everytime."
"I had tinea versicolor really bad on my stomach and arms. It was embarrassing and nothing seemed to help at all. But this, take my word for it, you will not regret it. This stuff had visual improvements on my skin in a 24hour span. For having this nasty skin issue for over 6months, of say this thing is worth every penny!  I urge you to try this!  2-3 sprays at least twice a day on the area of your skin and you will be better in no time!"
"Says &amp;#34;does not support this accessory&amp;#34; and now it a piece of garbage.  Be warned before you buy, the iPhone doesn't allow charging with it"
"I love everything about the Exodus-30th Anniversary CD;  the new cover is very nice!!!  Bob Marley's music deserves all the stars in Jah universe!!!"
"Interesting concept. This was a gift for a friend and she loved them, although they were a lower quality that what I was expecting."
"Gave this to my nephew for Christmas and he loved this guy. Both of his parents snowboard so he was excited about this guy, and it was one that he didn't have."
"Once I become an Early to rise kind of person I discover that I can do more by leaving my doubts and poor excuses in the bed before they become strong enough to seduce me into failing in my personal goals. Thanks to this book I have set myself to the challenge and seeing great results.Alejandro Balderas, Structural Engineer."
"excelente en realidad tienen la disponibilidad. llego en la fechas pautadas en mi talla y las especificaciones exactas justo como lo solicite"

"This 2013 calendar includes some of his very best, well-knwon works, and also some pieces I wasn't familiar with yet."
"I've read almost all of the Alex Cross series over the years and generally find them to be a fun, relaxing read. There are twists and turns in this one, but the outcomes are predictable.  This was not as intense as many of the others, especially some of the early books, but it was still an enjoyable read."
"Liked this nail polish but for the cost it doesn't really last long. If you use it as a top glitter coat it's fine but to use it as a solid shimmer takes up to eight coats."
"Drop once about five feet and completely shattered. Very cute case and shipped quicker than expected. Would not use if you're scared of shattering screen"
"I received a whole pack where the stickers were stuck together. Not worth the wait to get sent to you"
"very handy cant beat the price wish there were more music production terms but overall a good handy thing to have"
"This laptop never worked properly from the beginning.  I thought it was due to my infamiliarity with windows 8, but that ended up not being the case.  My wife and I run nothing too complex...Pictures, excel, word, PPT, web surfing.  Eventually the computer slowed down and we took it to the Best Buy Geek Squad.  They were good and did what they could, but it ended that a new hard drive was required.  I know a hard drive is not expensive, but I figure why throw more money at a machine that sucked when it was new?Note: I have a different Lenovo for work that works like a champ."
"Just by looking at the name of the book and the picture on the cover really says something. Creepy and you will want to stuck to this book until the finish. That i  did. What a time that family had..I had a heard time putting this book down just wanted to keep reading. this book is awsome. And i am waiting to read  another book by Jason McLeod. This book is well worth reading."
"I am happy to have come across this book, as it turned out to be an amazing reading. I must say that I have read a few books about angels, but the way this one is written made all the diference for me. The authors guided by the Angels wrote an easy to read and understand book. I have had it for less than a week and have seen miracles happen already. Positive things are happening in my life effortlessly. It is without a doubt divine intervetion and for that I want to thank the authors.Angelspeake: How to Talk With Your Angels"
"Cannot get all the air bubbles out. When using the included piece of cardboard, the protector has scratches on it and still has air bubbles."
"Looks exactly like the picture. not very protective, but very fashion forward. so glad i found it. i love it!"
"The size chosen for me from their sizes fit perfectly. The sleeve length and body length of the coat are perfect. It arrived ahead of expected delivery time, I am very happy about that! The ONLY thing wrong with the product was that the actual thing was 2 shades darker than advertised. Colour perfection is not a priority of mine, because I am happy so long as I can tell what the cosplay is with a  glance. However, if colour accuracy is a priority of yours, then so be it. I LOVE my new cosplay, thank y'all so much!!!!"
"I always have it in my iPad mini when I am not listening to music. The paint is not messed up, and the cat is very cute. Thanks!"
"Works amazing on my canon T4i, but I had to smooth the shoe so it would fit.I use it for a mic and a LED light for video."
"This hair was horrible. It matted really bad. This hair also contains dye because when you wash it, the water turns black. DO NOT purchase from this vendor."
"I have purchased this online and This product was easy to mount, use and very good to hold cell phone and GPS unit."
"This video is exciting &amp; motivating. Instructor is great with directions &amp; easy to follow after a few practice rounds. I always feel ""the burn"" the next whole week! Great video! Best of my collections."
"Excellent just what I needed. The case fits perfectly and I like blue so it makes my laptop special for me"
"I love the song, and the download has no issues.  What I did have an issue with was that this track has way to many beeps in it.  I didn't realize that I should have looked for a listing with 'explicit lyrics'.  Perhaps if the 'explicit lyrics' track had been listed with the one I actually got, it would have been better.  Thanks for listening."
"Good and looks interesting it a good way of interacting this to our children i recommend this good and interesting book Enjoy like my kids did?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"We've been buying the jolly balls for sometime, they are a great distraction, keep the dogs busy and really take a beating.  They are a great toy/product for the price."
"I met someone that was wearing nice cologne.  She told me that this was the kind she was wearing, however, I purchased it and wore it and do not believe that it has the same smell as the cologne she was wearing.  The cologne is nice and was as described, I just do not personally like the scent.  On the upside you only need to use a tiny bit!"
"The mattress I purchased is a great buy. It fit our portable crib, was exactly as described, and of good quality."
"I bought another since my older mop died and I hate the thought of being without it.  This is a fantastic product.  Unfortunately the one I purchased was not working and I had to return it.  I have since purchased another new one!"
"I was recommended to use these by my physician.  For minor joint arthritis pain/aching this is just like a little miracle in a box.  I put a patch on before bed and take it off when I wake up...no more pain, fabulous!"
"I purchased this the week preceding my total knee replacement.  I was relieved that I did.  It's a great product and was very helpful.  I recommended this same product to a friends mom following her hip replacement.  She said that she was thankful!"
"Eco Friendly Dog Pet Waste bags are ecofriendly and do not leak! I recommend buying them to pick up after your pet."
"it's a little smaller than expected, Must be mounted properly to really work well. The assembly only came with pictures no instructions but pretty easy to figure out"
"Exactly what I ordered. Came fast and discreet. I'd reccomend it. Does smell a bit but that's expected. Good product at a good price."
"A couple days with it. It's standing up pretty well I enjoy the iphone alot. And I hope to buy more in the future you should definitely get one."
"First of all the item arrived way before the due date which was very nice of Amazon. The phone is really great.. Although there is no wifi, 3g works just fine.. There are different apps that can be downloaded. I do not mind using a touch screen since its easier to text on this phone."
"I was a little reluctant to buy these beads because there was no one to review it before. But these beads were really nice on a chain and I hope to buy more in future"
"It's really pretty &amp; glitteryit came pretty fast as well :)the packaging wasn't damaged at all.very pleased with it~~"
"This cup is probably my favorite out of all the ones I have :)Came in perfect condition &amp; wrapped up nicely"
"Love how you can find albums of my favorite artist"

"made me think of when the event actually happened, live out there at the time. highly recommeneded. thank you much"
"its awesome when the light hits it, its better in person than what it looks in the pic. lov it"
"i am a big hunger games fan, i put it on as soon as i got it. just love it. hope i can find more when mine wears out. thank you"
"It was simple to use and the small bottle will definitely last if you're just using it on your face but it seemed to look a little orange the first day or two."
"This app won't open on my Kindle Fire HD. At. All. Grrrrr! I did try the Farm Frenzy 2 and it did open. It's fun"
"From the photo, I thought this watch was made of links and had a clasp. The watch actually is just a band and has a buckle. I think it makes it look a little bit cheaper than what I'd hoped for, but it's still nice. It's just a simple, everyday watch to wear. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday, I think he will like it. He's the kind who would beat up his watch quickly by working, so I was afraid it wouldn't be durable enough, but I think it is. Definitely not a watch that you would want to wear with a suit."
"If you need high quality, affordable screen protectors, then look no further. They are the cheapest ones I found on Amazon and there's three of them! Perfect!"
"This case came very quickly, within four days of the order. However, the color is not true to the image, in the photo there is a lot bright yellows and oranges which is not at all the way it actually looks. The design is correct, but it looks like a pressed on plastic film to a plastic green case... and the green is not as bright as it is in this picture. Also, I don't know if it was just the luck of the draw on the case I got, but the front piece doesn't even fit my phone, it's too small! Not happy with this product at all, and I have bought plenty of phone cases from here before."
"I ordered this book not for me but for a friends since i don't like anything by ellen hopkins (don't jump on me for saying that) but the book came new and didn't have any marks or anything so thanks, :)"
"This poster was bigger than normal poster size but still AWESOME! It makes and awesome addition to my man cave."
"Got the item sooner than expected and I have used it a little bit and its awesome and such a time saver. Worth the $12."
"bad quality, not for big toes, especially if you're an adult man. might work for women if they have small feet"
"Loved it but hate the way it ended. Why do sudden and hopefully there will be a part two. kudos"
"I was not expecting the end of the book to be so fast and quick to happen. I wish the ending had of been a little more drawn out but it was a good read."
"These shoes are a hit whenever I wear them.  They started to slide a bit but inserts fixed the problem.  They make your legs look amazing!"
"I was trying to crack XSLT several times using different books. This Guide was the one that helped me finally understand the subject. Thank you!"
"These pants seem to be well made but also seem to run small. They fit (barely) in the waist but were to tight in the seat and thighs. I wear both Levi and Canyon Ridge and they both fit fine. In closing while they are well made you will need to buy a size lareger in order for them to fit."
"I am extremely happy with these movies, but  must admit I am addicted to Star Trek. The quality is nice and I appreciate the fact that they are the theatrical releases. I highly recommend them."
"These are perfect for storing the spare batteries for my camera. The only thing that would make them better is if they didn't come attached to one another."
"The battery did not work and would not charge! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"This series from the start was humerus and down to earth .For a author to reach a seventh book in a series is a big accomplishment especially with a totally new a untested format . It is a brilliant with all the twist and turns from middle school threw high school this book is brilliant."
"It came in on time, and was not very expensive. The material fits comfortably, but those are the only good things about this purchase. I ordered a small and got a medium, there are no openings for me to put the buttons through (so the shorts don't button up, practically unwearable). Also, there was no return information to be able to send it back. A total waste of money."
"This TV is awful.  I bought it on Amazon for during the lightning deals, so it was a good deal.  So we thought.  After 2 days of use, while watching the TV would just go bananas asking us to reconnect the wires.  We returned it and received a new set.  Same problem again, except now we had volume that would magically increase on its own.  Once again we exchanged it.  So now we are on our 3rd TV, the volume problem has happened twice in the past 2 weeks.  It's been a few days so we're hoping it will just stop.  Anyway, awful TV.  Waste of money."
"Good amazing book. Thought I would have a better ending but now I am eager to get the next installment of the series to see what happens to the heroes of olympus"
"Great show interesting to watch and keep you wanting to find out what's going to happen the next episode one of the better Syfy shows out there"
"Of all the tattoo shows out there this is my favorite........  Tommy,Jasmine and Big Gus are definetly the masters of thr cover-up.......  It's good fun watching them transform some almost imposible garbage into top of the line works of art........  Great show......."
"Sorry folks........  This movie can be summed up with 3 words.......  Stupid,Borind and Dumb........  Like a prievious poster said ""move along folks nothing to see here"".......  Dont waste your time or money on this one........"
"Being a fan of most of the regular tatoo shows i thought i'd give this a try......  Love it!! Not only do you get to see the artists doing their work but you also get a idea for the business aspect of running a sucessful shop.....  seeing the transformation from a so-so business to a top of the line studio makes for some intertaining viewing......  Cool show.......  Would recommend........"
"This works well, easy to clean.  I use this at work for our keurig machine.  Does not leave grinds in cup."
"Arrived in excellent condition.  Love the whole set and the color.  Would recommend this set to anyone.  Price was affordable."
"This is One of the best books I've read on the power of prayer.Easy read and applicable  to everyday  life."
"nice torch! I mostly use it to light natural lump charcoal in my komado grill, works great!  good control over flame and the internal igniter is very handy"
"the burn pot is beautifully engraved and the wood coaster nice, but the top piece with the screen does not match. The burn pot is more of a engraved silver and black, the lid a plain uncleaned unpolished brass.. does not look like the product photo...  not a big deal I guess..  I give it four stars because of it."
"After a week it starts giving any preassure we called the doctors beliving my grandmother was having a pick according to this product and she was totally estable."
"It has an orange color, not red...I should have listen to the reviews.."
"This outfit is so warm and cozy - I wish there was an adult size! The same high quality you expect from under the Nile. I love all of their clothes."
"Three stars instead of five because while it is a French company .... It's made in china :-( still, a classic doll for childhood"
"Wish I could return these ! I opened the package , they are really cute but smelled toxic... I washed twice with tide detergent and now the seams are falling apart AND the leggings still smell like toxic chemicals! These will not be used.... Total waste of money"
"These hats are so soft and adorable.  They are a little on the big side (can cover baby's eyes) but its fine if you roll the hats up."
"love the Kissy Kissy line.... this is the perfect bring me home from the hospital outfit!  The newborn size fit our child until she was 2 months old, for reference."
"This fits my husbands laptop ok, is a little tight for an almost 17"" laptop. Has a very nice picture of the dragons. A little thinner than we thought it would be, but works just fine."
"I bought this book for my physics class. It is useful when you need to review material before a test."
"I needed this for a digital camera and the price was very good. You just need to make sure that it is the speed you need for your device in case you are using a DSLR or something, but for a digital camera it works perfectly."
"I'm a fan of spigen, I dropped a $100 on one of their Ipad cases before and I still use it till now. So I didn't hesitate to purchase a case from them for my GS4 and the case looked beautiful; people didn't even recognize the phone when it was on. but forward 3 weeks later and the rubber back started deforming due to the phone's heat. My headphones jack fit into the cut out so it only affected me when I'm at a friend's and using their speakers, so due to the plastic part being as fragile as most reviews say it eventually broke and now I have a phone without a case, thank you Spigen."
"Was Very inspiring book so I recommended to my husband He thought the same and we would highly recommend it to any one else"
"It's another Brother for my sewing room.....still learning what it can do......have figured out how to use the gather function and have used that for a Christmas gift....really came out well......will continue to work with manual and machine until I know it better......had no problem learning how to thread it, which I feared......Brother took care of that with their design....piece of cake.....even for an older person......"
"I didn't care for this book, I found it quite boring,  although I had wanted to read it for years and never had the opportunity, it just wasn't my kind of book."
"This is a very good book to read, it was hard to put down now i need to read the next edition."
"The dress  itself is sweet I don't know how they match these pants to that dress not too good otherwise I'll buy again thank you"
"Ordered for a buddy's kid. Says it serves its purpose!"
"(I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey ENTR 300 class and this is my recommended reading.)This book started out as a good read however, as the book progressed I began to lose interest. The beginning of the book was highly informative and was very detailed in regards to the challenges and accomplishments between Google and Apple. The book nicely sums up the rise of the technological age, and provided interesting facts regarding the development of the iPhone, iPad, android phones, and tablets. The beginning descriptions were very insightful, dramatic, and well-written. For example, in chapter three, Vogelstein describes an incident where Steve Jobs receives harsh feedback when he reveals his brilliant iPhone plan. Despite the harsh criticism Jobs received on his product, he still pushed forward, and in turn, create a whole new meaning to the word &amp;#8220;technology&amp;#8221;. I was able to take that situation and use it toward my own business.While the first part started off strong, as the book continued, I began to lose interest as the main topics originally stated began to disappear.  A lot of the ending points discussed we confusing and in a since, off topic, making it difficult to draw out the underlying meaning to the book.Overall I think the book was an ok read. While the book defiantly makes some interesting points in regards to starting and owning a successful business, I don&amp;#8217;t believe that the booked help me at all. I say that because my particular business is real-estate, something totally different form technology wars and inventions. I would have benefited more from reading a book that focused on the actual structure and maintenance of a successful running business. I do however, think that other Entrepreneurship students, looking to dominate the technological world can benefit heavily form reading this book."
"Excellent movie, great quality of Blu-ray.Great price for quality.Glad to had bought it as a gift, we'll buy the last one."
"The Price of a Gift is  a super good book!!  The author did a great job with character description and the relationships! As I read I honestly felt like I was there with them. Very easy to follow, I couldn't stop reading! The author draws you in instantly!!  Great read for teens and older!!  I can't wait for the next one Ashley Drake!!!!  THANK YOU!!!"
"This case offers great protection (I've dropped my phone dozens of times w this case and no phone damage yet) and it is sleek so my phone gets to stay thin and cute! The kickstand feature is convenient and snaps back into place magnetically."
"Well written, just as the previous book. I loved this one just as much as the first. I look forward to reading the next one, but for now I'm giving myself some time to read some other books ;) They're just so looonnnng :P Maybe not for some of you, but hey, it was worth it."
"Another amazing series from Dalglish, and more than worth the money I spent on it. The story is easy to follow, and a good one to boot ;) I don't want to look like just some fanboy, but I am. Either way, it's a great series, It's perfectly fine to read as a stand-alone, but it's easier to understand if you have a little bit of Dalglish back-story. Either way, it's as good a place to start as any :)"
"I have had a hard time reading this book, as well as the one before it. I wouldn't consider my experience &amp;#34;trudging through&amp;#34; the book, but rather, chugging along. I've read the first book of the series, the short story, along with this one, and I believe this is where the experience ends for me. If you're a teen reader under the age of 16 or so I'd recommend this book. It's a decent starting read with almost nothing in the way of complexity. Easy to follow &amp;#34;plot&amp;#34; The If you're at least a semi-serious reader of fantasy novels then don't waste time on this book. It's not that it's not good, it's good, but there's much better books out there to spend your time on. The book just doesn't flow well in my opinion, it has ups, it has downs, and it has bumpy patches that could have been smoothed out. Some parts feel like they could be fleshed out more, and others like they last a little too long with not much to keep the reader interested. If you loved the first book, read this one, if you had reservations after finishing the first, find something else. I hate to give it 3 stars, but the way I rate books, 1 is terrible, 2 is bad, 3 is good, 4 is great, and 5 is for only those few authors whom I feel truly deserve a 5 star review."
"I finished this book in a single sitting so I'ts not the biggest book around, but it was well worth the time and money I spent on it. I feel like the writing could have been a little stronger to make the &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; moments a little more &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34;. That being said, there is some decent suspense. I feel like it could have been fleshed out to a couple hundred pages or so to make a full book. Maybe giving some back-story, and maybe flesh out the characters. But who knows, it's Dalglish, maybe after &amp;#34;The Breaking World&amp;#34; he'll make the backstory ;) Either way, another quality piece by Dalglish."
"After reading the first I immediately came and got the second, and I am the better for it. I can't wait for the second to come out. This book has its issues, as do all books. But It's well worth the money, and the time it takes to read it."
"The story was very interesting and kept you wanting to keep reading.  Would recommend to mystery readers.  Author did a good job in keeping you wanting more."
"Had twists and turns.  Did drag a little bit but was OK.  Would recommend to read for mystery lovers.  Thank you!  B"
"I  bought this phone for my mother, who needed a new phone  no voicemail call waiting.just a phone. Nice phone worth out of extra carp. This is a basic phone . She has NO interest in Celll iPhone or cordless. THANK YOU. Roman"
"After 2 weeks of just normal use the binding is coming off/ the magnet has fallen to the side and will not close. The stitching is coming out. Just a bad product!! DO NOT BUY!!"
"Covers all important topicsContains good set of questionsDoesn't go out of scopeGOOD BOOK IF YOU ARE SHORT ON TIME AND WANT TO PREPARE FOR A TECH INTERVIEW"
"Easy, simple and looks just like the picture. I like not having to carry much and this wallet does it all."
"Fits well, doesn't slip or stretch off. Has done a great job protecting my phone from drops and falls. Looks just like the picture. The buttons are a little slow in response but it doesn't bother me."
"No words can describe this! I was so pleased when I opened the cute pouch to reveal this beautiful pink crystal pendant. Breath taking and so blingy! Would so recommend this to anyone looking for a gift for adult or child!"
"For appreciative lovers of the Art Nouveau era, a particularly nice book. Illustrations are very clear and beautiful. Would like to see more pictures in color."
"Story is written for highschool age readers.  Very inspirational themes particularly interesting for school students looking for ways to reach their own potential."
"This handbag fits on the shoulder without being too big and yet has room for all of the items I usually carry.  I love this color and will consider getting the same purse in a different color.  Sturdy and comfortable!"
"great"
"As a mother who loves eggs and chicken, I found this very informative. I want chickens which evil give me tons of eggs and a good amount of meat when the time comes. I also want to know my son will be able to watch and learn about chickens with less worry. This book provided me with that information and more."
"I'd been wanting to read this for a while now, glad I did.Now I keep wanting to shout, it's a warning, not a Damn blueprint."
"The author offers a simple and achievable plan with links to relevant info. However, his solution to cooking and heating water is propane. I would have preferred to hear about other options which would not require purchasing fuel, such as a solar water heater."
"I love this game. I'd have given it five stars if I could skip hunting predators, especially the ones that are struggling to survive as a species. It simply goes against my grain, but in order to progress I need to."
"When you read a thriller, you root for the good guy and hang onto their coat tails wherever the wild ride takes you.  With Liz Raci's book, you hang on for dear Life, and this time the bad guys are those nameless hateful people at B of A.  I laughed so much when I was reading it, It almost helped me to not hate the all powerful B Of A.  Almost, but not quite.  Who wouldn't crack up reading what is unarguably the most unromantic proposal in History.  I quote, ""We had been living together for a few years when I finally said, ""Are you gonna marry me or what?""  His respnse was, ""If I have to..."" Freakin funny! How our heroine gets out of this process with her positive attitide still intact is downright inspiring.  My own home was in foreclosure several times before we were finally successful, and each one of us could write our own story, but it wouldn't be as funny, encouraging and enlightening as this one.  In my heart of hearts, I hope Banks like B of A suffer for their greed, But after reading this book, I think I'll leave that up to God."
"I just received and set up the lighting studio. Directions were lacking simple, step-by-step walkthroughs for set-up but fortunately a lot of the stand equipment is modular and easily figured out. I did have a broken 105w CFL due to handling issues which I do not attribute to ePhoto and Amazon was great to refund a discount to my account to procure a replacement on their behalf. As far as the lighting is concerned - I was skeptical of using CFL for my main lighting but I have since changed my mind. I was pleasantly surprised at the intensity and saturation of the light. There are 4 combinations of lighting using the inner diffuser, outer, both or none. My 4 star rating is based on a decent product of good quality but lacks simple, comprehensive installation instructions for all the equipment in the kit."
"Its not creamy at all.. Hard as a rock! But once you get some crumbled pieces and warm it up in your hand its good! Jut not creamy like i would like it to be."
"So, I'm a mommy with a three year old.  This product is so much better than a purse, that it's almost hard to describe why until you wear it.  Due to the way it's hanging on your body (like a sash or seat belt), it's very ""stuck"" in place.  You can bend over, pick up your three year old, get them on your hip, and carry the groceries in the other.  All while your purse stays right where it is.  The shocking amount of time you waste messing with and re-positioning your purse becomes apparent, once you don't have to do it anymore.  Since you always have two hands free, the number of tasks you can preform while wearing your purse skyrockets.  Nothing falls out - ever.  Zippers and pockets and magnets and loops and snaps and everything!  :)"
"Nicholas Sparks can be depended upon  for a good story and this one was more satisfying than some since it ended on a positive note."
"I purchased this item after incresing my fitnesss level and needed some device for iphone 5. This did not disappoint .With its adjustable strap it can be used on any arm. Would recommend."
"The pieces were very nice and with high luster and detail.  I will certainly be getting her some more of these little gems."
"This album is great, it has that classic sound of early Johnny Cash.  Their voices are crystal clear, as well as their harmonies.  If you are looking for some new music with the old sound of earlier times, than check this album out."
"Amazing story that I couldn't put down.  A must read!!!  Two damaged people finding each other and the skeletons in their closets.  The details of their sexual encounters is tantalizing.  I loved it and recommend to anyone that loved 50 shades of gray!"
"Great love story with an innocent female and an over the top dominant rich male.  Looking forward to book three to see how their story ends!"
"The story keeps you on the edge-I couldn't out the book down .. Amazing is all I have to say."
"I just finished  3 and love them!  I can't wait for the next one!  I love that the story keeps you turning the page and wondering...what's next ."
"Great love story with suspense!  I love it, kept me wanting to read the next page and the next page! I couldn't put it down.  The steamy love scenes were the best! It's a must read...."
"Ok, so I liked the story but was a bit up and down and the ending just left you there....."
"I choose a five star rating ***** because this book traps you so that when you have to go to the bathroom you rush because it's that good! I like that she compared the story to her life she had staying in an academy school. Dislikes- none! I'd reccomend this book to people who went through hell and sunshine who've had their hearts broken and need to cheer up. To people who don't know the identity of one of their parents. YOU SHOULD READ THIS!!"
"i liked this purchased, this only issue i had was it seemed to take more than average time to receive the product. thanks"
"I got my guitar today,the packaging is really good. The sound it great and it comes with everything that is in the picture. Great for beginners for the price it is a great buy i would  totally recommend this to anyone"
"heats up fast, works well. I would recommend to a friend.  can be used to heat water for many things."
"You must treat yourself to a copy of Lewis Crystal's newest book of poetry!""Heritage"" is a wonderful collection of the author's fruitful harvests!A ""...Go with the flow of the Euphrates"" that tells his story.  Crystal is upfront and bonzerly blunt, and quite the hippy reminiscing the people, places and things that permeated his ink! A Jewish kid from Brooklyn who had his heart open, his eyes peeled and his soulful pen ready!  This collection will grab at your heartstrings and your smile muscles all at the same time! I've added this to my library, fer sure!"
"I purchased this because of reviews on this and similar products. I bought it used since I don't really care about the look of a book as long a s its reasonably useable. The seller I chose for ratings as well, and they gave themselves a large window for delivery,  but it came at their earliest projected date. That said, the book was in gently used condition. I've only just started to read it and so perhaps I may come back and provide a more in-depth look at its content and  information quality."
"This product is as described. It may be my hair, or maybe the shape of my head , but it tends to slide back. Also my forhead gets itchy because of it. I can't seem to find a comfortable alternative. Recommendations welcome."
"I am a Leatherman fan. I hate the old, original tools, but find that their new designs more than meet my needs in a multi tool. When my wife saw what I'd gotten her for Christmas(2012), she all but squealed! Made me happy that she was happy!I strongly suggest researching each tool before buying one. Chances are super high that they have one for your lifestyle, but don't buy one based on price or &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;factor."
"When I ordered these pouches, I thought they had elastic loops in them to hold the ammo in place. When they came, i was a little disappointed at first,  finding that they did not. My attitude quickly changed and I plan to order several more! I'm not in the military, nor am I in security.  I own a handyman service. These pouches are fine for holding batteries(which is why I purchased them in the first place). I found that they also easily attach to a belt for convenient carrying of small items you need every day! I regularly keep my Leatherman and a flash light in mine. I've also used in as a change dump when I'm paying cash at a drivethrough. I highly recommend these pouches."
"I used this on bedbugs in a friends wheelchair(seriously! I'm not making this up) and all I can say is,&amp;#34;holy crap! Don't use this indoors! Certainly not in a small room! I didn't get any on me and I was almost incapacitated! I was coughing and eyewatering, and my poor friend who couldn't walk and stuck in the room with the vapors! If you use this , be ready to deal with the consequences!  Good stuff!"
"Extremely entertaining! There are a few things I'd change, because,  it's WAY to easy to hit buttons on the screen while trying to accomplish the goal, interrupting your progress.  Fun overall, though, and extremely entertaining!"
"Excellent book. Must read for all people as the points discussed in book can be applied in life. It has ability to change your perspective about the way you handle situations."
"my brother like it very much and the fabric and color is good.. it let him looks young it is good goods.This jacket price.. OK.."

"bought this for my nephew and he loves it!"
"had a hard time to grow these but i have more that I will try again"
"I read the book in a day. It was very infromative. It tells you why you should start the cleanse and what steps you need to take to be successful during the cleanse. It also breaks down how you may feel physically. This was very helpful for me. When I went through some of the withdrawal symptoms I knew how to cope with them and to keep pushing through the cleanse. I lost 10lbs during the cleanse. I also lost inches. I'm thankful for being able to break my sugar addiction and start a new healthy lifestyle. Great Job JJ Smith!"
"These Skechers are very comfortable and are my go to shoe when I am in a hurry.  I love the taupe color with a little bit of sparkle in the trim."
"My hairdresser uses this mousse on me and I really like it.  I was able to get it at a great price on Amazon."
"I love the top of this shoe.  Not sure if the wedge is too big for me.  Size 6 1/2 was not available so I bought a 6 which I can sometimes get away with in a sandal.  I have to wear them around the house to see the comfort level.  I really want to keep them."
"I liked the look of this shoe until I tried it on.  It felt somewhat heavy and the front strap cut into my foot.  Unfortunately, I returned them."
"I have looked at this book and it has a lot of very useful info in this book. It has answered question to a few things i was wondering about with my camera!"
"I have also let my friend borrow this book and i have been told it is very good and has lots of info in it"
"I found it to be very good once I got to sit down and read and there wasn't something going on! It took a little time for things to get rolling but once it did look out!"
"Looks just as advertised. Some slight cosmetic damage, but in great shape.  Can not wait till we use it tonight."
"I bought this DVD for my boyfriend to watch while recovering from rotator cuff surgery.  I'm glad I did.  It was it great condition and my boyfriend (a punk rocker from the 80's) loved it."
"I originally gave a bad review due to shipping. However, this is a GREAT price for both products! I love the sweet gesture of baby dust and my Husband feels more energy after only a couple days! This is well worth any shipping issue I had. Thank you and fingers crossed~"
"Character development, decryption of surroundings , were all wonderful. I felt that I knew the people and where they were and how they felt all thru out the story."
"Nice quick read, likable characters, with a different perspective, though not quite believable. Would be a great young adult read."
"Cat Byrd, you are an amazing writer. Thank you for your gift of a free book. Please allow me to buy another novel."
"Do I have a regular basis of the first tome typically have it is the first tome this is thenest of"
"I've had this camera now for about a month and used it extensively in the garden and traveling.  The pictures are crisp and clear and the amount of functions are amazing for this price range.  It took a while to get used to the function dial, but I really like being able to toggle between auto and specfic functions like 'vivid'. The view finder is a little off but I'm so glad to have it as an option to the screen. It was really hard finding a camera in this price range with a real view finder.  Thankful to come across this camera. Totally enjoying it and the batteries last well when not in movie mode."
"This book was fascinating from the first chapter on.  Jacob pulls you in with his &amp;#34;teen angst&amp;#34;, and softens you up with his relationship with his grandfather.  It is full of unexpected twists and turns, and the photographs add an extra mystery to the whole plot line.  Want to see more from this author!"
"love the game. bringd me back to childhood.is somewhat challenging and addicting. I would recommend to all to play. easy to play and my daughter and I love to play the game together."
"This ring is super pretty and has the ""look"" of being close to authentic although the stones around the center are small and need cleaning often. I would definitely recommend to everyone to buy CZ and not real diamonds. Real diamonds lose their value and you'll never get retail price or even close. Save your money! The issue I have with this ring is after 3 months, the center stone fell out. Just looked down one day and it was gone. Make sure to check the prongs regularly and don't expect much from a ring under $50."
"I love it It meets all my expectations. It is easy to use and the battery lasts a long time."
"EatSmart Precision Digital Bathroom Scale is the great scale. As advertise, the weight will show up in a second and accurate. Compare the price with other scales in the market, this product is the best with the technology and quality. I recommend it."
"I've had this flat iron for a few weeks now and I love it. I haven't had any problems with it. I usually set the dial half way to 450 and that seems to be just the right heat setting for my thick, wavy hair."
"This is a gorgeous book for anyone.  Whether your a child or a child at heart you will enjoy this beautifully illustrated, well written book.  It is the story about a little girl, Princess Jasmine. and her older sister, a dog named Moo.  They get to travel all around the world to meet Moos fur-riends and on the way learn valuable life lessons that every child should learn.  I loved the book just from the illustrations, love it more when I read it.  I feel this is one book that you will love also.  I just hope Dr Debbie Mamone continues the series and graces us with another excellent book of her ""Once Upon a Rose Princess"""
"This is a great story no matter your age.  It it beautifully written and illustrated by a mother and daugnter team, Gabriele Mamone and Dr. Debbie Mamone, a Pediatrician.  It is about all of these fur friends who have met from all around the world and yes, they really do exist.  They have all gotten together, well, buy the book.  You won't be disappointed and you will be able to meet all the characters and see their real pictures in the book!  And if you didn't but the first Once Upon A Rose Princess buy it also, you'll love it. &amp;#9829;"

"Very adorable, kids abosuletly love it! Perfect for crafts and dining."

"This game is a waste of space on my device in my opinion and would advise nobody to get this wierd game unless trying to do some kind of prank. I deleted this game right when i got it and i bet that is what everyone did who got this pointless game. You should definitely not get this game."
"Injustice is a fun filled upgrading, fighting, and challenging game that involve the majority of all Warner bro action figures. This game is by far one of the most fun and challenging games that I have ever played on kindle."

"A good romance . Not all the  characters developed the way one would  have liked but Worth the read as said before."
"The story was good was not the simple girl moves to new town and meets boy story.  There was intrigue the personalities of the characters were developed and the setting one could imagine.  One could actually see the movie.I really enjoyed it."

"They are pretty flimsy but at $2.00 apiece they accomplish what I bought them for. To heat things up in the microwave."
"I mean what is there to say about the best fishing reel ever i mean ever i have been useing these for years and i won't use any thing else. I have landed a 75 LB catfish with one so do i need to say any more. Just get one you won't be disappointed with it."

"Found this book quite boring but I had to read all of it to make sure. Not really my genre but the cover pic was gorgeous."
"Unfortunately I found it a bit long winded and boring. I finished the book but now cant really remember what it was about so that has to tell you something."
"My absolute favourite from this author. She is funny, quirky and this was another Kristen Ashley tale to get caught up in"
"This book is a very, very, very close second after Dream Man. Thoroughly enjoyed revisiting all the characters from Dream Man and falling in love with some new ones."
"A great insight into motorcycle gangs and how the brotherhood works. I was intrigued but felt there were a couple of things unfinished and not explained fully."

"Delivery was quick. But the material tore really easily. All she did was pull it up and it tore. It was hard to keep up in place."
"i bought it originaly for the price, but now i have it i very stisfied as good as any product i found in the retail store at half if not more off!"
"I love that you can build anything, I think it's the most addictive game, and you can build anything that you want to because I've done that. There are so many levels in campaigns that I will be playing for months.can't wait for an update!"
"i like this phone..Not alot to complain about except the lack of directions given with the phone.basicaly they cover how to get started on the phone...but not things like how to move and store things like pics from text messages oe multimedia messages. I still cant get my blue tooth to connect with this model phone and there is no trouble shooting for this in the manual either.i have a plantronic bluetooth.  The apps were easy to dwnload although i dont have a need for all of them....This phone clearly was made for people that have a wrking knowledge of android phones and their apps."
"I just got this today. The massage is somewhat good, but not great. It is more like a low rumble than anything, but I didn't get it for that only. That was just a bonus. As a lumbar cushion on its own, it does a good job. I can already feel the effects of it after sitting at my office chair for a few hours. My spine feels aligned. I also like that it has a strap that you can tighten to tie down the cushion in place.My only concern is the durability of the battery compartment. The outer construction is fine and the foam is fine too.The color is also black, not a light grey as shown in the pictures.Also another poster mentioned something about the massage not functioning even with batteries in. The reason could have to do with the batteries not touching the positive terminals. I had the same issue, but after nudging the four batteries towards the positive terminal, it started working."
"Fellow law students (also medical, engineering....anyone who spends their days reading out of giant books), this is the book stand for you.I'm not much of a reviewer usually, but this has totally changed my life so I couldn't help myself.Pros:No more stiff neck...worth the purchase on this point alone.Makes typing while reading, which used to be a time suck of shifting books and looking around, as simple as could be.Now this is true of any book stand, so why this one?- 1st of all, sturdy as can be AND tiny. No trade off here. Can hold even my biggest textbook (I'm looking at you, Cherminsky).-The clamps are really sturdy, but easy enough to move out of the way for turning pages, so no additional time wasted there.-Like I said...it's small. Smaller than I expected, so I was a little nervous, but it does all it claims to do and takes up less space doing it.-The adjustable back is great. Never realized how useful it would be to be able to change the slant depending where I was using it. Even found the appropriate angle for reading in bed, which was an unexpected benefit.Cons:You may have noticed that I only awarded four stars even though I can't stop rambling about how great this product is. As much as I love it, there are just a couple more things I would look for in my ideal book stand:- First, portability. Yes, this is small, but something foldable would be better for taking along to the library with me. Most of the foldable stands out there can't hold paperbacks and aren't adjustable, but a stand just like this that you could fold up and toss in your bag would be great. Wishful thinking? Sure. But the heart wants what it wants.-Second, with a bigger book (still got my eye right on you, Cherminsky), it's hard enough to use this when you're too close to one end of the book that I just don't use it at all. Basically, with most of the pages on one side the clamp can't hold it in place. Yes I'm talking about 1,000 pages, but since the clamp slides to hold almost any size anyway, I don't think there's any reason it couldn't be a little larger.TL;DR: I love this book stand... if you need one, buy this one. Totally adjustable, small, sturdy and useful. Love you, Actto!"
"Love it but it runs too big, try a size smaller. The style is so feminine and the fabric is to die for."
"So I've order the Super Nail line, from cuticle remover to powder, to primer and I have got to say that 8oz is more than enough to get my started on my &amp;#34;nail journey&amp;#34;."
"I wear size 15 wide shoes normally, but they only had these in 15 at the time. I needed new running shoes so I ordered them anyways. They were only $38 and they arrived at my house in only three days. They were snug at first, but most new shoes are, they fit fine now and are comfortable to run, walk, and lift in. They look good too. Highly recommend them, I will most likely buy another pair when I need to in the future."
"A good book. Could not put it down. A good easy read book. Can't wait to read the next novel."
"A very fun game. I can not stop playing it. It is all I can do. I can not stop playing. Must give a try."
"While the description of this product clearly states that it fits the Kindle Paperwhite, etc. the labeling from Kate Spade, the manufacturer, states otherwise.I know this because it says so inside the cover ""This case is made for the Kindle Fire only. enjoy!""I assume that's why the review written before me also complains that the cover is too big for their Kindle.Amazon has opened a ""research case"" in reference to the mixup since I called customer service.It is a very cute cover and seems very well made, unfortunately if you order it for anything but the Kindle Fire, you will be disappointed.  That is the only reason I gave this one star.  Otherwise, it seems great!"
"Great quality cat loves it easy to put together and sturdy.  and was priced well compared to the pet stores"
"A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!  If you are even remotely interested in this book, read it.  You will be happy you did"
"Great case, feels great in the hand! Doesn't add much weight at all to the phone. Doesn't fall apart, much more smooth feeling than the normal silicone case covers. Volume and power buttons are still easy to get to."
"This is not for an Ipod touch 5.  It's designed for an iphone.They would not take it back even though its not what I ordered."
"Excellent DVD!!!!  Git it while its hott folks!  This dvd is out-of-print!!  You know you want it for Halloween!  Spooknasty."

"Love this bedspread, perfect weight, quality and fits our king size bed perfect. Very happy with it and will be purchasing another for the spare bedroom."
"This item worked great on my 1994 Ford f150. why the need of spending all your money on different rim when you can just get these."
"I use this headset on a desktop land line phone with a headset jack.Pros:Comfortable, clear sound, no issues with microphone.Cons:No mute of volume adjust on the cord. The cord could be a tad longer.Overall I would recommend this, so long as your phone has built in vol and mute features."
"My second pair for work.  In between I have tried Danskos and Alegrias.  Did not like either.This shoe works much better for my feet."
"I REALY LIKE THIS GAME IT'S LOT OF FUN TO PLAY. THE MUSIC IS GOOD . I LIKE THE BONUS PART OF THE GAME THANK YOU"

"Let me say that I'm a huge Adidas fan.  Have been loyal to them for over 20 years.  Started running last year and have loved all of the Adidas running shoes I bought.  There are some runners at work who love New Balance so I hesitantly decided to try them.  I love them.  They were so comfortable right out of the box that i wore them for hours after I received them.  They fit perfectly.  I'm a size 8.5 in Adidas and same now for New Balance. I def found my new running shoes and will def be buying New Balance again.I just purchased my second pair! I love these shoes!  No more Adidas for me!"

"I'm not sure about this book.  I liked it yes, but there were parts of the book that I was like WHAT????  They go from no sex to a sex marathon and then they are having sex while eating breakfast.... I didn't get that part.  Also is the author not from the state's?

"Exactly what I want it. Highly recommended. Good quality product. I used it many times and it serves it purpose."
"Its ok I guess for the price. Is a good kit for amateurs that want something out of the ordinary. Just keep in mind that the glass will scratch easily. Besides that, everything else is fine."
"I took a little drink every monday after 2 days weekend.It refreshes me well and keeps me energetic.Love grape flavor. No sugar added"
"I purchased these for an upcoming dinner party. They arrived on time and in great shape (they were packed very well to avoid damage). The plates are classy and gorgeous. The forks are very unique. I plan to purchase more that I have seen them. It's definitely a great buy for the purchase price."
"I bought this doormat to ensure I wasn't tracking any dirt unto my newly shampooed carpet. It picks up everything. When I opened the door this morning, it had a bunch of blown leaves stuck in it. If it can catch leaves, it can definitely catch dirt, when I wipe my shoes. Nice buy!"
"I have always loved this song from back in the day, and I truly think that its so upbeat that it makes you want to dance, or changes a sad mood into a great one. Great cleaning music for around the house as well!"
"I purchased these for my office. I wanted a classy set of coasters to utilize for my customers. I had already purchased the Godinger Crystal Plates &amp; Forks set,, so this was a nice addition to match them. They arrived on time and in great shape. They are very classy and gorgeous. I plan to order more."
"It was an educational movie; however, I am uncertain that it's 100% realistic, as many people aren't vegetarians. It's a difficult task for those who especially never liked vegetables to begin with."
"Great inspirational music and motivating to anyone who is looking for good traveling music, work music, or just to be uplifted!"
"Nice study package to encourage and inspire to never give up on goals from small ones such as weight loss, to bigger ones like running a business, etc. Great study! Great combination of reading, viewing videos, and completing weekly workbook lessons."

"I tried this with the Colon Cleanser. I wasn't sure with the combination if the Garcinia was actually working, or if it was just more of the Colon Cleanser. From what I can tell, it worked ok."
"I could not stop reading. It's a page turner. I like that Michael Jr. didn't turn out to be just like his dad. I don't like that fact his father keeps getting away. He's just too evil. I think he's really the DEVIL. Can't wait to start book three. I recommend this book to anyone to read. I take that back, not no Christian. Lol."
"GOOD read!! She has to get her life together. Instead of her mother protecting her she should of took her for some help."

"The story line was good but the way the people acted was very awkward.  The conversations and confrontations were just bizarre since very few people actually act that way. It's almost as if the author hasn't been exposed to very many people."
"I really do love this game but I have to reset my kindle every time I use it. It's a big pain"
"This is one of the few albums where the musicians have actually gotten better rather than just trying something new. I was nervous of what Chris Adler would bring to their sound but if he has done anything, he has brought a solid foundation to their sound. It is somewhat overpowering at first compared to earlier albums but after the first few songs, it melds so damn well with the band. I love the direction they went while still doing the shoutouts to the styles from Kezia and Fortress. They kept their progressive sound and overall style while still doing something removed from what they have done before.My best friend put it best:When I look at bands today, I ask why, with all of the influence that they have, do they choose to sound like they do? This is the first band I have heard in years that has taken influence and created something new, imaginative, and so God damn good.If you have a mind for musical experimentation, an appreciation for raw talent, and a need for a new direction in progressive metal, buy this album twice."
"Works just like the one that came with my Vizio TV i had lost the original didn't know what to expect when i ordered the remote control but  i  recieved  it on time and it works great,  i am completely satisfied"
"I think it is a good app but it does not have sound. I got this for my little one who cannot read yet."
"She loves this guy, i have the extreme opposite taste in music but she likes it so i guess it was a good gift."
"was a little slower to ship than the rest of my order but for the price it was worth the wait. its hard to find a decent cell case for a guy that isnt just black for the droid 4. stands out and people seem to like it. i kind of expected it to be a little more rubbery since its &amp;#34;rubberized&amp;#34; but id definitely buy from this company again."
"I have always consider myself politically of the mind of W.E.B. Du Bois but after reading this book I had a deep look into the soul of Du Bois and what makes him tic.  He was a DEEP intellectual who I feel felt like he could never truly be understood by his peer because I don't believe he felt anyone his equal."
"I really love this case.  It has exceeded expectations.  I highly recommend this case to anyone that is in the market."
"Great deal. Quality was much better than I expected for the price. Color is perfect match. Very hot although I did expect that as satin always is. Better suited for winter bedding. Looks great"
"Super cute! True to size and colors are as bright as they appeared. Comfy fabric but may require ironing.... Not that I'd iron baby clothes!"
"Its a really great book the way it was written it makes u feel and imagine wats going on and its gets u excited i really rocommend this book trust me you wont regret it"
"I did alot of research on this unit and others before I made the purchase and what I found out is alot of ppl install it them selves rather than getting it installed professionally. So those ppl had alot of problems with different things. Since I saved money on the unit I paid best buy to intall it.  So far I've had no problems with it. Everything works great!!"
"These 3D lens are build very well. They are sturdy. They fit well over corrective lens. They are comfortable. I'll have to get the red/cyan if they have them. Good product."
"I disconnected it because it does not do the job.  It's just sitting on the cabinet where I have the TV.  I thought Sony was a good product but my TV is a 42&amp;#34; Sony and between both of them the sound is not very good."
"Only reason I gave this story  four stars was cause I wished it was longer. Very funny. I recommend to anyone looking for a quick read."
"&amp;#34;Pokemon Charmander 4.5&amp;#34; Soft Plush Stuffed Doll &amp;#34;It is just like on the picture. It was perfect as gift.Thanks."
"This has got to be the worst game that I have ever played. When accessing some of the puzzles there is no way to back out of the puzzle if you are stuck and out of hints. This game will immediately put you to sleep. If you are given an alternative to die for play this game, take the bullet it will be a lot less ppainful."
"great stuff, great taste, blends easy, low carb and sugar, add a little pb for an awesome shake, you will love it"
"I love my mouse pad and my friend likes the one that i got for him. The only problem that I've had with it at all is that it has a weird smell to it and it has a tendency to make your wrist smell as well. With out the smell it would have gotten 5 stars."
"Very realistic. Romance parts a little too long for me.Well written. Would recommend to anyone who likes a war story."
"Well written/ did not want to put it downVery realisticLots of details and interesting facts tsThe end"
"Bought these at Wal-Mart the other night. They seemed like they'd be pretty cool, but instantly had the black plastic piece on the smaller knife fall off on me. Easy fix but they could have put more effort in securing that piece down besides a single strip of (barely adhesive) glue on the back side. Then, the next day I had the screws strip out on the belt clip on the larger knife. Keep in mind I hadn't used these knives at all except to clip onto my trucks headvisor. You get why you pay for. Other than that, the blades on both knives are very sharp! And the belt cutter and the glass breaker are definitely a great add on (main reason I bought this set)!"
"It Was Just What I Needed FOr My Mother Home Her Door Ways Are Small And I Could Fit It Just Right"
"The fan fit perfectly in the fan hood and works great.  I am concerned though, with the fact that the stator is considerably smaller and light weight in comparison to the original."
"Great book to read on the kindle! Continue the adventure with a new, and very enjoyable plot. This is my favorite book in the Harry Potter series."
"This book is a definite keeper. I recommend it to all males looking to get over their boring lives. Read it!"
"This game is quite innovative in that it combines multiple genres including a variation of the point and click detective adventure, grand theft auto, and the Phoenix Wright-like choice dialogue system. The main issue I had with this game is that despite the great job with facial features, tone, and what not, that give you clues as to what you need to say. Throughout the game you are supposed to use these human features to determine if they are telling the truth, lying, or if you should doubt them about a piece of testimony. It can really be random, kind of like in Phoenix Wright games where the dialogue does not make clear at times to what you need to do, especially since human aspects that indicate you should pick lie, or pick doubt, are quite similar. Luckily, if you are a perfectionist, there are plenty of guides. However, this is the type of game you really can't enjoy the first time unless you don't use one. Another thing, and this is for the xbox 360 version of the game, before you buy, you should know that the game is 3 discs due to hd dvd's terrible storage capacity."
"Save your money. You can easily find these exercises on the internet. No need for the book. -certified international sports science association trainer"

"can someone please tell me how big this one is how wide is it because i bought oneand it was really small"
"Very nice book. One thing lacking...how to make suet. Love the extra info in this book. Great info for habitat and landscaping preferences for the birds as well as high of the bird feeders, the types of feeders, and even how to make a feeder. All very wonderful additions to a fun book of recipes for bid food. Except that most of the recipes call for suet and the book lacks a basic suet recipe. I can google that and the book still had valuable info."
"What a beautiful book. Full of life and humour.  I found myself highlighting so many of the authors bites of wisdom. Totally surprised by the quality if the story and its gift of insight. I've never read a torode  book before and now I'll buy more.  Thank you."
"Well done. The book has a good layout. Each section is informative and flows well into the next section. Very good book if your into our just discovering astrology."
"Not what I expected. I thought it was a story about one of my. favorite  characters but as it turns out it is about a book of poems and. Life lessons still a good read. But not like the dirty parts of the bible."
"A fun book filed with great ideas. Non of these were to difficult and each idea included pictures as well as simple instructions. This is the first ""homemade"" type book I've bought and I had an expectation it would be short on graphics so I was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of pictures."

"Would have to pay a lot more money if I would have to use the company that put the fence in"
"The batteries are the same as the company that put the fence in,but the price I paid thru Amazon for 4 batteries is what I'd have to pay for two.  So why pay $40.00 for two batteries when I can get four for the same price no brainer."
"Unfortunately it did not work due to extra notches on it. Can't get it to snap together. Would've really liked it if it had fit."
"I got my case yesterday and it fits very well. I have 2 complaints though...I don't know what it's been kept in or what but there's an odor that's almost unbearable! The other thing is I'm not fond of the stylus pen. I think it should be easier to use like the one that came with my Samsung Galaxy Note II."
"I gave this norelco powertouch to my brother for Christmas. He said that it is so much better than his last one and highly recommends it. You charge it for one hour and it's ready to go.  He just loves it!!!"
"I was very happy with Amazon when I found this in the selection of movies that were free. Thank you Amazon."
"This is a amazing game! It's so addictive I can't stop clicking and clicking! I love this app and I reccomend this to everybody!"

"It was a beautiful dress, I'm just too fat!!"
"Its a really good case...but doesn't last long.The corners start to tear after a few months of continuous use. But its not horrible by any means and it covers my nook well. Just minus the tearing in places its a decent products"
"Nice and simple design! Love the bright green color! Fast shipment.  Has some light scratches on the cover but you can's really see it after you put it on the phone. I'm satisfied."
"The venue I rented only had rectangular tables, so I had to come up with something that worked and looked beautiful.  I used 2 of the 60X60 Square Table clothes for each table and underneath I had plain white full rectangular tablecloths I picked up cheap, so I placed the 2 tablecloths on each covered table and it was magnificent!! I got so many compliments on the decor.  I had 3 table cloths that had small stains after the reception and I put regular dish soap on the back side of the stain, used a delicate brush and rinsed out the stain, worked perfectly!!  I highly recommend these table cloths!!! They are absolutely gorgeous! Tried posting a picture, but amazon will only allow video and I do not have video."
"I think she likes it but the verdict is still out on whether the cloud is better than storage on the computer. It is fast , new and efficient."
"It was a gift. She loved the color and protection. That is all I know since it isn't mine. End."
"Shows are laugh out loud funny!  So good to see these ladies together in one place, and no one is a diva.  They genuinely like being together, and it comes through in the shows."
"So far it works very well.  Have tried it USB and also eSata and both work as expected.  Being able to swap drives with ease is a must for anybody who repairs computers."
"I bought this belt for my husband because he goes thru belts like crazy. I figured I was going to buy a good one that would last. This is it! I will never have to buy him another belt! He has had to adjust to it and get used to how it goes on. (He complained that it took longer to put it on than a normal belt.....big deal it takes an extra 30 seconds!) Anyway, Im so glad I bought it!"
"Size is true. Colors vibrant. My husband will look like Magnum at our 80's party.....as long as he can grow the stache ;)"
"The clips were great. But the only thing I hated was the fact that the tangled very easily and they were so thin. Other than that they were pretty good. They also arrived wayyyy before the were suppose to"
"Although it doesn't have that snug fit I was hoping for its still a great product to me. It arrive 2 weeks early and I'm loving it"
"There were a couple other reviews under the Glock front sight removal tool that suggested this one instead.  For the price, in comparison to the Glock tool... this thing is exactly what I needed at less than a quarter of the price.  I couldn&amp;#699;t justify getting the Glock tool...especially when I&amp;#699;m only going to use it maybe once or twice in the next 5+ years!!!Buy it...you won&amp;#699;t regret it.  It fits, it works, and it&amp;#699;s worth it."
"You know... you can actually just use a small punch to push out the pins on your Glock, but it wasn&amp;#699;t very expensive, so I bought it.  I like it, because I know which tool to use when I&amp;#699;m cleaning my glock lower and don&amp;#699;t have to figure out which one of my punches to use.  I&amp;#699;d recommend it if you own a Glock and want all the Glock accessories... get it.  It&amp;#699;s not very expensive."
"I like it.  It&amp;#699;s a great tool.  I LOVE the open assist.  I&amp;#699;m going to buy one of their knives next."
"For the price, this is a great item.  I don&amp;#699;t really use the magazine pouches, but I put my Glock magazines in them and they fit great. I ended up putting the pouches on my backpack for things like a flashlight and glowsticks.As for the belt itself.  It&amp;#699;s made well. Buckle seems to be pretty decent.  It&amp;#699;s not a cobra buckle, but for the price, I&amp;#699;ll take it.  I use it as sort of a &amp;#34;duty belt&amp;#34; with kydex pistol and AR-15 magazine holsters on my left side, my little rolled dump pouch towards the back, a kydex Glock holster on my right, with my survival knife just behind the holster. I have enough room to even add a mini blow-out kit.Four stars for another good product from Condor."
"I&amp;#699;ve seen other reviews and I agree with everyone who loves it.  It helps with recoil, but it also gives an extra inch or so on the back end of the rifle and I like that alot.  It also looks pretty cool.  I&amp;#699;d recommend this to everyone who has a Mosin Nagant."
"works great with my Paache airbrush.  The original had a plastic top that the hose screws into.  The little tip broke after the 3rd use.  This one is made of metal, and the cap is also metal. I&amp;#699;ve alread used this bottle 4 times with great results."
"I was sort of expecting it to be a little small. But that&amp;#699;s my heads fault, not the product.It&amp;#699;s really lightweight, and looks good.  I think the brim part is a little smaller than expected... but good nonetheless."
"Not a whole lot to say about these patches. I got 5 different ones from Gladsen and Culpeper, and got free shipping.  I think the patches are decently made, with good stitching. The quality on the patches is good, and heavy duty enough.  Not incredibly awesome...but good, and for the price 3 bucks...5 stars because I got 5 patches shipped for FREE."
"Ok so this light is NOT 400 lumens.  I&amp;#699;m not sure how they&amp;#699;re getting that...but it&amp;#699;s probably not even 200 lumens.  My Olight T25 which I received in the same order is listed at 210 lumens, and it blows this 400 lumen light away. Next thing that was a little odd: This little flashlight arrived in NO packaging other than a little bubble wrap bag, which was inside of a brown shipping envelope.  There were no packaging or invoice paperwork, no directions, no nothing... But I knew that was probably going to happen based on other reviews I&amp;#699;ve read on this light.  The light is decently bright.  Didn&amp;#699;t blow my socks of by any means.  It&amp;#699;s compact, runs on a single AA battery, and has a decent clip on it.  The focus feature is...nothing really.  I just keep it on it&amp;#699;s brightest setting and leave it.  To cycle between modes you have to quickly press the on/off switch.  I like that it stays in the last mode you had it in.With that being said... I paid 7 bucks for this light with free shipping, and it arrived ahead of schedule, and in great condition.  I cannot really complain because I knew exactly what I was getting.  I gave it 3 stars because it&amp;#699;s just ok.  Nothing special.  Just a decent Cree LED flashlight that runs on a single AA battery.  I would probably buy a couple more to give to my wife/kids to keep in their car/purse/bag. It&amp;#699;s small enough that it doesn&amp;#699;t get in the way too much."
"I own a few Condor items: bags, pouches, chest rig... this was the first jacket.  I was a little nervous about buying it online, without actually &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; it and putting it on, but I did it.  And I'm glad I did.  I've only had it a couple weeks, but so far I like it. I think for the price, it really gives a lot.  I needed something that would be wind resistant, and offer rain resistance, that was lightweight and breathable. I think this jacket covers all of those needs.  I don't believe it is waterPROOF, but I think it's resistant enough for what I intend to use it for: Hunting, shooting, backpacking in Hawaii.As others have said in their reviews, the zippers as quality as I'd like, but they're ok.  I didn't see any frayed seams or anything like that, and the jacket seems to be well constructed.  For a sub $100 jacket, I think it's well worth the money.Don't compare this to a North Face, Columbia or Patagonia jacket...that's not what this is. You won't get THAT kind of quality and weather resistance in this jacket that's half the price!  Nor is this jacket mil-spec. Don't expect that either.It's an $89 jacket that offers a LOT for that $89 bucks!"
"This kit has all the stuff you&amp;#699;ll need, (and some stuff you don&amp;#699;t) and it wasn&amp;#699;t extremely expensive.  The only thing I added was an airway for CPR, and some extra bandages of different sizes, and a small tube of antibiotic. There are bandages and single use antibiotic packs...but I needed more.  I use this kit for a summer program in Hawaii, and our kids are always getting small cuts and scrapes because we&amp;#699;re outdoors quite a bit. So bandages and antibiotic are the first to go.I think it&amp;#699;s well laid out, everything is clearly marked, and the clear plastic helps a lot when you&amp;#699;re trying to find stuff. I also like the bright orange color and large print: MEDICAL KIT on the side, makes it easy to locate.  I would recommend this kit to anyone who is going to be outdoors on the water or in the mountains. I gave it 4 stars because I had to add those items, and I&amp;#699;ll probably have to add some sunburn treatment (aloe gel or other), and an instant ice pack or 2, but other than that this kit is good.On a side note... yes I probably could have put together a kit of exactly what I needed so there wouldn&amp;#699;t be any wasted space or unusable items, for about the same price or less...possibly.  But I knew going into this purchase that I was going to add a few things to supplement this kit for my needs so no big deal.  And I was impressed by the layout of the bag, and it&amp;#699;s content.  If you want to see what&amp;#699;s inside, Adventure Medical&amp;#699;s website has some really good video&amp;#699;s on all of their kits."
"It was a great read I enjoyed it very much .it held my interest right up to the end."
"You can't beat the price.  My daughter collects old cameras so I decided to get this necklace for her.  I was pleasantly surprised by it."
"i enjoy this CD for the music.  I like Marron 5's new music and I hope they keep coming out with this kind of music."
"It is so nice and in blue ray the picture and sonud is great. If you are a fan this is great."
"this item is exactly as advertised and works wonderfully. thank you for an amazing item :). Hope it lasts a while :)"
"Shipment was fine. Item was as described. I would recommend this dealer. It was a good deal on the shoes."
"If you like doing nail art, this is a great book! It doesn't have any tutorials, but if you know basic nail art tricks, you can easily recreate the pictures. The designs range from classy and elegant to fun and colorful. This book is a great resource when you're not really sure what you want to do with your nails! I really love it!"
"My wife loves these.  We are high school sweethearts that spent 10 years apart before reuniting.  We have now been together for just over 4 years and have been married for a year and seven months.  I have bought here one for every major life event they make."
"Easy to mount and is truly universal.  They also look REALLY good.  I recommend these for anyone wanting to make their surround sound look better."
"My wife and I had some really crappy wifi out of our internet provider router but now we can go just about any where in our house and still be connected.Setup: This item was really easy to set up. By plugging this into the wall and connecting using your laptop you simply type in the URL included in the manual and you will have access to all the settings of the device! This takes 5-10 mins to set up as an extender or router.Dual Purpose: This can be used as an extender as I am using it for or it can be set up as a new router. I have tested this as a new router, and it worked amazing. I decided not to keep this set up as a router because I was just needing internet on a single device. If you have multiple devices being used on your internet setting it up as a router would be a great idea.Design: This is very solidly desinged and also looks very stylish. It has indication lights to let you know it is working and also has a ethernet port that you can use to set up a direct wired connection to your computer after you extend the range of the internet.Overall this item is great and really helped me get my internet working around my whole house! The best part of this item is you can unplug it and take it to a different room without having to set it back up as a repeater. This is a mobile wireless point so you can always have the best connection possible without having to worry about losing internet!"
"I couldn't finish the book because I was flipping through too many pages because it was going into much detail about their sex lives. It is not necessary to go into all that detail, leave something to the imagination. I would not recommend this book"
"I loved this book! I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  I had a hard time putting the book down and when I did, I couldn't wait to pick it back up.  Kristen Proby is one of my favorite Authors."
"Hi,Very good job!!It was fast and accurate.I was even more surprised by the speed of the delivery.The computer was received in excellent condition and met all my expectations for the price I paid.I' am about to buy the same laptop as a gift for my son that will take place tomorrow.Keep up the good jobPhil"
"I love the book and the series, i do need and want the next book........ &amp;#128516; refugee made me cry at the choice Aria had....!"
"Thanks for your letter! I got it! It is a good present! LOLAnd hope you have a good weekend!"
"I am just learning how to manage cooking times, but, I love its portability and ease in cleaning. I would recommend for anyone who is not a big barbecue expert."
"Not typically the type of book I read but a friend was reading it and highly recommended it. I downloaded it and finished it in a day! I couldn't put it down (except I had to for work and my 1 year old) I loved this as well as the short book on Fallon. Can't wait for the next!!!"
"I thought this case would cover more of my phone but it only covers the back. Not very protective. The description also didn't mention it is sheer therefore making the design black and purple rather than white and purple like in the picture since my phone is black. You get what you pay for."
"Works great! No problems at all. Definitely worth the price! I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an extra nun-chuk."
"Invest in better goggles. If you want to see everything in orange these goggles are for you. Go photocromatic it is worth it. Julbo is fantastic So are Smith optics I/o"
"Super soft. A little warm though. If you like it really cool like I do ( I have my thermostat on 64) you may want a little lighter insert. overall really happy quality product"
"Great they fit like a glove. I would buy them again if I needed to. I have had the same one for a year and is still holding up"
"This duvet cover is extremely soft I absolutely love them to death. But there was one thing I didn't like the button that keep the insert in were not sewn on great when I put the insert in for the first time two buttons came off"
"Works great!!! Take your time putting on. Micro bubbles will work themselves out. Follow instructions its very important. Very strong. Note: I did have a problem with microbubbles the first one they worked there way out but left a white spot. I sent back to Amazon and received a new one. Amazon is great when it comes to returns. Overall you can never go wrong with this site I really buy verything but food from here lol"
"Fits like a glove. Not to bulky. Just enough protection for your phone. I have dropped my phone a few times and have had no problems"
"Small but does the job. I would get the larger one though. The make is top notch. Amazon is the best!!"
"Heavy and big it is not for petite women or for dressy affairs.. After saying that I really like it as it beautiful and very fascinating."
"Rough feel to it. The regular liner is better and easier."
"Nice neutral color but I guess I need a good primer as it didn't last very long at all."
"Great item my goodness we had a huge windstorm after setting it up and it made it through while our neighbors canopy ripped to shreds sadly. We put weights at the bottom if coarse as it was a bad windstorm. Highly recommend! Beautiful and sturdy"
"This was a very good and touching story.  Almost had tears n my own eyes at the end.  Keep up the good work."
"This is very cute and so comfortable, and for the price way way better. im very glad i bought this."
"The pijama is nice, but it says 2T and the top part came way to small like if it was for a new born and the bottom part wayy to big. Not happy at all."
"I loved this dress, exactly what I expected. The night i wore it all eyes were on me, definitely recommend this dress."
"Good human hair, exact length, the only bad thing is that I ordered black and they sent me dark brown."
"The Mynns' Mystery is predictable.  It's very hard getting into it, and I have yet to MAKE myself finish it!"
"I chose this rating because my book is in better shape then I thought it would be. Good deal!! :)"
"I LOVE Julie Lessman's new book, Love at any Cost.  This book is ANOTHER AMAZING, SUSPENSEFUL, and PASSIONATE work by Julie Lessman.  I have read all of Julie Lessman's previous books, and this one exceeds the rest.  This book is realistic, has twists and turns, and DEFINITELY NOT PREDICTABLE.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the book had my rapt attention during the whole entire book.  Julie describes everything and makes you feel like you know the characters and setting.  You feel as if you are in the middle of the book while you are reading it.  Julie has the AMAZING ability to portray the characters as if they were your best friends.  I truly love this book and recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Abby R"
"The lights are great! Awesome price. The only bad thing is that i got them 3 days later than sched."
"A+"
"Its a pretty awesome game especially if you have  the original dragons dogma game save to get the limitless ferrystone to fast travel."
"The book breaks an entirely new ground.  While the premise is plausible,  will others develop the rigorous theoretical frame work"
"Very Cute! And perfect for my 9 year old nephew to make his own Chocolate Milk with! I gave a 4 star because I am not sure the cup will last long. As it seems sort of weak. But it does its job for now!!! Great price for the Moo Mixer!!!"
"Love this oxo set!!! I am slowly acquiring all the sizes. They cost more than many other canisters but I find these to be unique!!!"
"For my first set of snap in hair. I bought two because it was priced so low. Im glad I did. I was able to cut six inches off one set and I now can make my hair look layered and thicker. I have had compliments on my hair both times wearing it!"
"I like it a lot...... it is very nice, nice color, good material and soft,and fit perfect!! looks amazing!"
"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HELP ME LOOK BETTER. SMALL HAIR ON MY FACE BE CUT WITHOUT HURT THE SKIN."
"IT HELP ME TO USE MY IPHONE LONGER. I CAN USE IT DURING MY FLIGHT AND NEED NOT WORRY OUT OF BUTTERY"
"I bought this for my 13yr old daughter and she loves it! She can prop it up with the kickstand upright or sideways for music videos, movies, and it keeps her phone well protected! I wish they made this for the Samsung Dart!!!! I give it 4 stars, would give it 5 if they made this for more phone types!! :-)"
"I liked this key chainChosed it for my black camaro ss keyNice materialRecommand it for people who like simple and modern design"
"If you like British murder mysteries, you will probably like P.D. James.  She has wonderful development of characters in her writing."
"Wall Street Journeyman is a remarkable book.  The novel takes us through the life and times of one man's journey to significant success on Wall Street trading desks and the subsequent decline in his career.  The vivid descriptions of his youth and the violence he and his family experienced at the hands of his father are graphic and chilling.  But his relationship with his father was very complicated and the specter of his old man haunts him throughout his life.  The protagonist is obviously brilliant and we hear his thoughts and feel his passion as he rises rapidly in the industry early in his career.  We see a man that is capable of great compassion and kindness, but also ruthless, aggressive behavior.  The protagonist is often quite reckless, but handles adversity with courage and conviction.  He is a man capable of twisted, decadent actions, but also someone that possesses a keen sense of humor and is brutally honest with himself throughout the saga.  The story is full of unexpected twists and turns with significant doses of dark humor.  The description and analysis of the financial industry is excellent.  The reader gets a first-hand look at the phenomenon that was Wall Street during the past twenty-five years.  We learn the kinds of money made by Wall Street professionals and the organization and business strategies of these firms.  We get a true inside look at the industry along with detailed descriptions of the crazy shenanigans and excesses these young, highly paid professionals got involved with.  Wall Street Journeyman is a triumph.  I strongly recommend taking the journey."
"This chandelier is awesome. I love it, love it, love it. It was easier than I thought to assemble. Great stuff."
"Very happy with the product and very inexpensive for the quality. And definitely love the colors very happy with my purchase"
"This mouse was a major improvement from my old dell wired mouse that I've had for years. It is very lightweight and have 3 sensitivity settings that were very useful. The mouse itself isn't very comfortable in your hand, but like with everything else, you get used to it. I've had this mouse about 8 months when it started to act up. The left and right buttons would start to double click or sometimes wouldn't click at all. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the actual buttons, it might just be that the sensor inside the mouse is going bad. It gets very annoying when playing games and greatly affects gameplay. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because you will not find a better mouse for the same price anywhere.P.S. The LED in the mouse stays on even when I turn off my computer which is very annoying and the mouse must be unplugged every night."
"The overall design of the mouse is great. It feels very good in your hand and the laser is very precise. Now what I didn't like about it is the weight and the lights. This mouse is noticeably heavier than all the previous mouses that I have owned, which makes it harder to pick up and move but you eventually get used to it. The main reason i gave this mouse a 3 star rating is for the software. It comes with a CD that has the driver for the lights and other settings in the box, but you need to change the name of certain files so that your computer can recognize them because they are originally in Chinese. Another option is to download the drivers in English from Overload Forums, which you have to make an account to get permission to download it. Once you finally get the driver installed, it doesn't even work! The only setting for the lights that does work is the one that cycles through all the colors, which I believe is the &amp;#34;demo&amp;#34; mode. I wanted to change it to solid blue to match my case, but that is not longer an option. Overall, it is a good mouse, but if you are crazy about the lights and being able to adjust setting on the mouse, there are much better mouses out there for this price."
"The wig is very smooth and brushes out well! The bangs have a lot of hair and will most likely be trimmed. The netting does not show in the wig and the length feels natural. The shine looks natural and the wig fits nicely. Great value for the price!"
"Its a toy. Would not want to claw my way out of a wreck with this thing... There has to be better."
"Mass produced Chinese mount - a bit sketchy. Different as pictured and does not have the bolt - only thumb screw. Was banged up pretty good as well with corners missing paint. Rock solid for kids airsoft playtime, you can do way better for real AR builds. Little GGG mount is bomb proof and made in America! Return was challenged by Amazon..."
"Very fast - straight forward install. Cannot comment on longevity. So far so good. Very good reputation on this particular drive with full 5 year warranty. FYI - cheaper Samsung SSD pull back to three years on warranty. Cannot comment on the whole warranty process and hope to avoid it!"
"i was fooled tothink that the bikini attachment was a shaving part as well as no where did it say it isnt. until i received the item and i saw that its just a trimmer and it didnt work on me at all"
"it looks nice in my kitchen and serves its purpose well. my bills are finally organized with 1 section for bills not paid, 1 for recent paid bills and the other for important documents to be taken care of"
"what a brainstorm! puts the magnets on wheels! my kids love this part as they place animals or people in the car and close them up with the window parts so it looks really exciting as they ride around the house! i'll definitely invest in a few more of these!"
"I loved everything! It had the best combination of love, drama, sex and thrill. It wasn't so far away from reality, as some other sex novels."
"This thing is wonderful. Razor sharp right out of the box. Deployment is uber smooth and makes the knife a joy to whip out. Nice and small, it fits perfectly in any pocket. The best part is the titanium handle, which makes it lighter than air. Solid knife by CRKT."
"Good solid knife. Decent steel, came very sharp out of the box. Nice G10 scales. Very simple, yet very elegant. Almost a &amp;#34;poor mans gentlemen's folder&amp;#34; if you could call it that. Very nice knife though."
"This is THE best budget knife on the market. Spyderco did us all a favor by making some affordable folders. I love this knife and I love Spyderco. Buy this knife!!!"
"This thing is amazing. Very solid lock-up. The liner lock is flawless, as Michael Walker intended it to be. Extremely sharp out of the box, with great G10 grip. The camo looks awesome too. This thing is BIG too, so make sure it's legal to carry in your area."
"Package arrived fairly quickly, which was nice. The case itself isn't bad; it fit my phone well enough. Not sure if long term use would scratch it or not because I only use it as a backup in the chance that my expensive case breaks.Good deal overall."
"This knife is BIG. Absolutely RAZOR sharp out of the box. Thumb hole (Spyderco's trademark) makes deployment easy as pie. Much better than a thumb stud. Spyderco is second to no one. Buy this product with confidence, but make sure that the size is legal in your state first!"
"I can now dance if I want to, cuz I left my friends behind. Cuz friends should dance and they didn't dance so I told them all to go to hell."
"This was purchased for a s&amp;w40ve with laser sight it does not fit. I ordered this especialy for this purpose."
"Even as a grandmother, &amp;#34;The Tomato Fairy&amp;#34; was a delight to read. The enchanting poetic verses tell a lovely story that ended by warming my heart. The bright and colorful illustrations are a delight to see on each page. &amp;#34;The Tomato Fairy&amp;#34; is the perfect gift for my grandchildren's birthdays!"
"I read the whole book and I think some of these jokes are pretty funny, I think I'll read the next book.:):):):):):):):)"
"Still using. Love it. One if my frst online shoppinh products. And if all are as great i may become addicted lol Will buy another soon. Hope u have camo ones lol"
"I love all the bright colors!  Can have a different color for every day. I would buy more! Shipping was fast and great pricing!"
"it shipped quickly, but when I got the earrings to put them in two of the studs fell out.  I did not yank on them so they were already loose."
"The toilet came extremely well packed, and was right on time.  It was easy to install, with high quality components.  Doesn't come with a seat, but that's not a huge deal.  Even though this was a little more expensive than some others, I'm very satisfied with the purchase."
"I got one from my mom and loved it. You can hold it with one finger. It closes tightly to slip in your bag, it fits in the car cup holder, it also is insulated so it doesnt sweat all over everything. But yes I dropped it while getting into my car and it broke, badly! I went back to order it from KMART and they no longer had them. I was sad, but I got the name off of my moms bottle and here it is. I love AMAZON! and am so glad I found my favorite bottle again."
"super soft, cups well formed. I actually fell asleep in it the other night which I never do with bras. I cant wait to buy another. Arrived quickly as well. Thank you"
"I absolutely love the fit. Levi's are the only jeans that I feel truly comfortable in. I never spend much on jeans or clothing in general but these are my splurge (may not be for many others) but I am on a extreme budget. These are worth every penny. love them"
"I am very disappointed because of the length of this item. The width is perfect but it is so short I will probably never wear it. The material is great but unless you are into belly shirts I wouldn't suggest it. I am 5'5&amp;#34; and weigh 140. was thinking it would be perfect but it isn't. Too bad because well made and super cute"
"This is not a very good facsimile of FB. The screen can not be enlarged. The display does not look like FB on a PC. The only positive aspect is the videos play fairly well."
"Three weeks into our new home and no one has knocked.. Of course when you couple this with a &amp;#34;do not knock, do not disturb&amp;#34; sign and a &amp;#34;go away&amp;#34; door mat it sends a pretty clear message."
"I spent a lot of time looking for a couple of decent desks for my daughters room. I didnt want the veneer covered fiber board that looks like crap in a year and takes 4 hours to assemble. I also didnt want to spend $500-$700 for a solid wood desk at the local furniture store. Unless you need a hutch or drawers I dont think this can be beat.  Four bolts assemble this and everything lined up, the legs went on in about a minute each, then one screw for the sliding drawer knob, thats it."
"having been overseas for over 9 years I didnt realize that this was sold in the local mega store( think blue vests) so unless you want to spend 3 to 4 times more like I did, do yourself a favor and pick it up the next time your in wally world"
"Mesa Tactical is the top of the line when it comes to side saddles. This is SOLID and mounts with no gap between the carrier and the receiver. I am very happy with it."
"I bought this for a guest bedroom so i dont know how it sleeps but it seems very comfortable. It is the third memory foam mattress that we have bought online. I think they are way overpriced in the furniture stores ($1000-$2000 plus) and it is the same exact thing, maybe with a different cover sewn on it.I also bought a mattress protector for this and I would suggest you do the same if you are planning on buying it. The only reason that i didnt give it 5 stars is because the cover is a little loose even after over 48 hours of unboxing.We have a 1 and 2 year old that cosleep and they have since birth, they love the memory foam mattresses, you can get up, or they can roll around without waking the other, thats not going to happen with a conventional mattress."
"I have bought taps, bits, and this tap wrench from Vermont American and ive never had a problem with any of them,"
"It fits perfectly and installation was a breeze. Securely holds my 4 piece brake to my M92. You really want this if your going to mount any muzzle device on your M92/M85 (as long as it has the indents)"
"It is good buy just if you are to strong watch the screws. Don't over tightened them because they will break off. Very easy installation."
"Excellent!  Goes well for my set up of the family history.  I hope there are more world Barbie dolls at an afforable price as this one.  If you want something for display--these dolls in their cases/boxes are great.  I like the price and if other world Barbie dolls prices drop I will continue to collect them."
"I may have read the information wrong but I did not realize that it came with 2 books of it. Best $10 spent on manuscript paper."

"Water For Elephants is by far the best I've read in months. Just amazing. Jacob is funny and entertaining, keeping your attention through the whole story."
"This case fits like a glove... I Love the color and the texture...it's super soft and is exactly what I needed."
"The wallet is perfect. Very small (heightxwidth), fits everything perfectly BUT with only 5 cards, it got really thick and can't even close. Imagina with 9"
"It had all the materials, but the DVD did not work so used is used I guess. Bought a new one"

"the picture is stunning definitely the HD it promises.  I was slightly disappointed to discover they no longer offer the special effects"
"but it was great and i saved a lot of $ by buying on line and it was brand new looked like  bought it at a store"
"i loved it and so did my bf it was the best gift ever and i couldn't have found better in the store"
"Great read. I love the subtle personal growths of Eve being displayed, how it makes her a more rounded character. Her evolution as a wife and friend plays into her relatability as cop and advocate."
"Cute, lighthearted love story that doesn't take itself too seriously. An easy read that was a good palate cleanse between my usual darker, murder mystery; thriller; suspense; detective story."
"It's a pretty decent game for free, but it does get a little mind numbing. All in all this is a fairly good game."
"This movie is a masterpiece the visuals which were a big part movie were done beautifully the tiger BTW is all CGI something I was astounded with the acting was done perfectly and the storyline is fantastic sometimes it feels a bit slow but its pprobably because I've seen it a few times all in all this movie gets a 4 out of 5 and I would highly recommend buying on Blu ray if you have a Blu rau player to appreciate the visuals this movie offers."
"I was very disappointed, they were a lot smaller than I anticipated. The picture was very misleading, need a reference to show approximate size... maybe a dime or a quarter beside it. The quality appeared to be ok."
"Totally disappointed, they sent me the wrong set for my phone. the plug-in does not fit my phone a Pantec Breeze 111 p2030. I did not bother to return it because of the cost in paying S&amp;H to/from. Very disappointed, I was really looking forward to getting a quality product that fit and worked."
"Great product, it was more than I expected, I really liked the texture and custom fit. Perfect and great price.Highly recommended!"
"The information here was good but it's way to much money to pay for it.  Another guide book I read had include the same cartoon strip information but all so had many other chapters with more detail.  This book costs way to much."
"The candle warmer does a nice job and it was shipped promptly.  I only wish the light could stand a little taller so I can get larger candles under the light, in order to melt some larger candles."
"I bought this product in June 2014. The filter just lasted for 1 week and then the water started tasting like lime. I complained to the manufacturer but the delivery of the filter was delayed by almost 20 days. We got a replacement filter but within 3 days the water is again tasting sour. I am going to return this product and look for some better product."
"Was searchin on the actual fathead site and decided to look for this on Amazon instead.!It was exactly what I expected. It's big, good size and smooth. Worth it!"
"Love the MJ and love dancing if you love both i recommend they have a wide variety of  MJ songs"
"Bought it Large but bf said it fits like a medium. He said he does like the image on it so i guess that makes up for it."
"i digged everything just not the bridge. had to order a new one online. also i didnt like that the bridge kept popping out everytime i kept tryin to tune it. overall i like the body work, color, and style!"

Makes me look like an awesome gf :) Ladies I strongly recommend getting this for your loved one ...well if he likes this type of hair products"
"I never write reviews but this one deserves it. After spending actually wasting money on primers I finally found one that works!! It keeps my makeup on all day and doesn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts. I use it before and after makeup and still use a setting powder after. Very happy with this, will definitelybe using this forever."
"It was  good would've liked different styles, but it was good over all I really liked the color same as the pictures"
"I was slightly disappointed with this product because all the lipsticks look the same on me... bright pink. They are good in the fact that they moisturize and stain my lips for a long time. They are good if I wear one and then apply a real lipstick over it so if my actual lipstick fades, my lips will be stained from this product."
"Some inspirational mantras in this book but I certainly found more than just one simple thing to keep in mind."
"Throw all my favorite Disney movies in a mixer, add the talents of a great writer and some dystopian dust (you know, like fairy dust. Haha.), mix it up and voila! I got myself a brand favorite book of the year that makes my inner child come to life again (aka run around screaming with her arms in the air in a pink princess dress and a fake crown on her head). Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: THE SELECTION!""I hope you find someone you can't live without.I really do. And I hope you never have to know what it's like to have to try and live without them.""I think it's obvious already that I loved this book. In case it wasn't, well, I did. I do. I love the story and the characters and everything about it! America is such a great main character, someone I could relate to in many ways. If I were to live in her world, I would be like her. A five. Only three steps up from nothing. But while she doesn't want to be a princess, I have always dreamed of it since I saw my first disney film so many years ago. I loved her and she would make a great Disney princess! (This book would be awesome as an animated Disney film, too.)Now I shall talk about the first fictional character ever I fell in love with. (Seriously I shed a tear because I knew he wasn't real. Sigh.) Of course I'm talking about Maxon. He's so... Maxon. Sigh again. Maxon.Okay moving on. Aspen. I loved him at first. So romantic and loving and caring and then... a complete stupid douchebag. I hate him.Speaking of hating someone... I hated Celeste. She's so mean and stuck up and bleh. But I loved Marlee and May and all the other characters!As I said, I loved this story. We got to know America while the story builds in the beginning until the inevitable moment she gets chosen for The Selection. She stays true to who she is and never forgot where she came from, another thing I loved about her by the way. She's different from the other girls in many ways and refuses to change for anyone. I loved how the relationship between her and Maxon grew along with the story and I fell for Maxon along with America. And when they kissed my inner child was so happy she fainted. Yes, that happens.But not everything is rainbows and sunshine in the palace. There are these rebels, what their purpose is we have yet to find out, who form a threat to the royal family and I liked that. That's what gives it an extra dystopian touch. But life goes on in the palace and I loved every part of it! Until that douchebag Aspen came back into the story and messed things up again. I hope for him that he doesn't mess things up in the next book or else... Well not much he is a fictional character so I can't do much... But if he were real, I would kick is ass. For sure.So in the end, this book is everything I hoped it would be and more. I can't wait to start the sequel (luckily I don't have to since I just got a copy from Netgalley, yay!). Great job Kiera! I LOVE YOU!"
"Oh my god. That's about the only thing I can come up with now. Oh my god. This book was so... Brilliant, original, heartbreaking, sad, happy and full of love and friendship. I may have a new favorite for this year!This book is about Addie. She lives in a Compound, a place where people with abilities live. It's top secret and the Norms, normal people, don't know about it. Addie can see where certain paths take her in the future when she has to make a choice. When her parents tell her they will be getting a divorce, she has to choose to stay with her mom or her dad, who is leaving the compound to live in Norm world. In one future she is pursued by the hottest guy in school, Duke, but she never wanted to be a quarterback's girlfriend. In the other one she's adjusting to live outside the Compound with her dad. She meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive and sweet artist and he understands her. But when her father is asked to consult in a murder in the Compound, she's drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything and everyone she loves. Love and loss in both lives, but she has to choose which one she wants to live through and who she can't live without.This was such an amazing story. The writing is so great and the world where Addie lives in is so original. I loved how the author chose to indicate which future it was at the beginning of each chapter. This story was build so great and both futures blended together in so many ways, especially near the end and I know she must have worked on this a long time and thought it through about a hundred times. So amazing! The romance in this book was beautiful. I believed it and there was no insta-love or anything like that View Spoiler I loved the characters too. Addie is so cool. I wish I had her power sometimes. And I feel for her too, but I know she makes the right choice in the end. Laila is such a vibrant and funny character! And Trevor may be my new book-boyfriend. All of them were great, even the bad ones, who I still hate. Well developed and surprisingly realistic for people who have abilities (well, not all of them of course). Awesome.I highly recommend this book to everyone. It's a must-read for sure. And I'm so glad I have the hardcover because I will re-read it many times in the future and I love the cover too. Just awesome. And Brilliant. And breathtaking. Read it. NOW!"
"4.5 starsKasie West has done it again. She just blew me away. Although in a way, I think I expected it. Pivot Point was so great that this one just had to be great too. It's awesome and made me feel all fluffy and light. Seriously brilliant. The characters, the writing, the story... Amazing!The Distance Between Us is about Caymen and Xander. Caymen is an only child and lives with her mom above their doll store. They don't have an easy life and it's hard to get around with the little money they have. Now Xander, he's the opposite. He's pretty rich and handsome at that. But you know what they say... Opposites attract! But will it last?God, what can I say about this book that hasn't already been said in other reviews. This book was so great. I loved all of it. I knew the writing would be really good. I mean, it was great in Pivot Point, so. And I expected the story to be good too. And it is. It's sweet, romantic, breathtaking and full of cute moments. Those dates Caymen and Xander went on were so weird and original! Well, they didn't call it dates, but that's what they were. And I loved that. And it wasn't insta-love. Their relationship grew and when to romance finally came, it was sooooo amazing. And they don't tell each other `I love you' immediately, which also is a great thing because I don't like that very much and it's not realistic. But this book was!Of course I loved the characters. Even the minor ones. I mean, Skye and Henry were awesome and so funny! And Mason... Yeah he was okay, but I didn't really like him that much. I didn't know whether I liked Caymens mom or not. Sometimes she was pretty annoying, but in the end I got why she acted the way she did. And I liked Xander's family!I loved Caymen. I really did. Her humour was just... hilarious. Probably because mine is also dry and sarcastic, so I got all of her jokes and I laughed out loud a lot so. She's *exceptionally* good at it. And she was very relatable, which made the character more real! But there was one thing that really bugged me. Her attitude towards rich people. Actually, that bothered me with her mom too. They made it such a big deal and the stereotypes were just stupid. So he's rich, so what? But hey, that's the only thing in the entire book, so. And Xander is awesome. He's so perfect for Caymen and I really loved him. He was funny too! Their conversations made me laugh and giggle out loud. (Not fun when I was reading on the bus and people stared at me...) Guess first impressions aren't always right, which is kind of the message in this book I think.Amazing book with a breathtaking, sweet and cute romance. But not just love, also friendship and a very good message about how first impressions can be very wrong. Kasie West, I won't think twice about buying one of your books ever again. I'm just going to do it. So is my copy of Split Second on its way already or...?"
"This review contains a few spoilers for the first two books in the series, Cinder and Scarlet. If you have not read them yet&amp;#8230; I suggest you do that now, because you&amp;#8217;re missing out. There also may be a few minor ones for Cress.Oh my stars, this was awesome. This is by far the best book of the series so far, for me personally. I loved it so much! I read it the minute I got it in my mail and I finished it that same day. Could not put it down. Cress is a action-packed, brilliantly written, amazing, wild roller coaster ride. And as soon as all of it has processed in my mind and I have written this review, I will go and cry because I will have to wait for a whole year for Winter.Cress is the third book in the Lunar Chronicles. In it we first meet Cress. She is a very talented hacker and has lived in a satellite for years as a prisoner, working for the Lunar Queen. But she has other plans and calls for help from our beloved gang. Cinder, Thorne, Wolf and Scarlet go to her rescue, but stuff happens and they get separated from each other. Cress and Thorne are catapulted down to Earth in the satellite, Scarlet is taken by Cress&amp;#8217;s mistress, Sibyl to Luna and Cinder and Wolf manage to escape in their ship to Africa where they meet with Dr. Erland. The clock is ticking and they have to find each other again and make a plan to stop Queen Levana.Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. My heart was racing the entire time and I just had to keep on reading. While the other two books were a bit predictable, Cinder more than Scarlet, this one was not. Which had me sitting on the edge of my seat for all of the 550 pages. I think that&amp;#8217;s why I loved this one the most so far. The writing is still incredible and really, I bow to you Marissa. I really do. There is not much of a recap, so if it has been a year since you&amp;#8217;ve read the other books&amp;#8230; shame on you! You could&amp;#8217;ve done a marathon and then crawl to a corner and cry like the rest of us because of the long wait for Winter. Seriously though&amp;#8230; A year? I don&amp;#8217;t compute.So stuff happens when they rescue Cress and they are separated. Scarlet is taken to Luna as a prisoner and even though she didn&amp;#8217;t have a lot of story in this book, it&amp;#8217;s still really intense. Especially towards the end. My god, Marissa, you are merciless! Which brings me to Thorne and Cress. When they crash to Earth (of course they don&amp;#8217;t die, the book would be over if they did, so it&amp;#8217;s not a spoiler), something happens to Thorne which makes him blind. At first I was raging mad at Marissa for doing that, because well&amp;#8230; we all love Thorne. But he still is the same arrogant handsome jerk we all hate because we love him, so it&amp;#8217;s all good. They are stranded in the desert and I loved how they bonded. And Cress&amp;#8217;s first moments on Earth were actually pretty funny, because it reminded me of Rapunzel in the Disney movie Tangled when she first came out of her tower. (Yes, the song would fit perfectly for that moment in the book too.) Overall, Cress was pretty similar to Rapunzel from Tangled, which I loved because I love that movie. You know, she&amp;#8217;s a bit awkward around other people because she&amp;#8217;s been alone for all those years except for a few visits from her mistress. She&amp;#8217;s funny and yes I can picture her defending herself with a frying pan. But she&amp;#8217;s also an amazing hacker and a really great character and I loved her.Then we come to Cinder and Wolf. Wolf also doesn&amp;#8217;t have much of a story because he&amp;#8217;s knocked out for one part of the book and practically a zombie the other part. He worries about Scarlet, which does give him some character development. Cinder has a lot of pressure on her shoulders and in this book, she&amp;#8217;s really scared and worried. What if she can&amp;#8217;t save the world? What if her plan goes horribly wrong? And I loved that too because it means that she&amp;#8217;s no Mary Sue and it makes her more human too. But of course, she&amp;#8217;s still a bad ass cyborg Lunar princess so she kicks ass when she has too.That leaves us with the other minor characters. There&amp;#8217;s a new one (sort off), Jacin Clay. He&amp;#8217;s a Lunar Guard who actually helped Cinder and Wolf escape from the satellite. He&amp;#8217;s mentioned in the first book too if I remember correctly. Then we have Dr. Erland, also from book one. He&amp;#8217;s in Africa, where Cinder meets up with him and he also has a storyline, which I&amp;#8217;m not going to talk about because that&amp;#8217;s a spoiler. So I&amp;#8217;ll move on to Kai, who I love again! In Scarlet, I had a love-hate relationship with him, but not anymore. He&amp;#8217;s a prince and he&amp;#8217;s hot and he actually does things right in this book. Well, for the most part anyway. That leaves us with&amp;#8230;. Levana. Yeah, still hate her. I&amp;#8217;m not going to talk about all the other side characters, but I do want to mention one of them because she has a pretty big role in the fourth book! Yes, Winter makes an appearance towards the end. I won&amp;#8217;t spoil anything about it, all I&amp;#8217;ll say is that she&amp;#8217;s not what I thought she would be, in a very good way. And it makes me even more excited to read the next book.Stars, it seems I have a lot to say about these books. They are just so brilliant and I love them so much and I try to avoid thinking about how long the wait is for Winter. But time goes by very quick for me these days, so 2015 will be here before I realize. At least, that&amp;#8217;s what I hope. Of course I recommend this book! Fans of the series so far won&amp;#8217;t be disappointed and if you are&amp;#8230; I think you read another book. So if you haven&amp;#8217;t had the chance to start this one yet, brace yourself because you&amp;#8217;re in for a wild ride!"
"So a guy who hunts and kills murderous ghosts with an athame and travels from city to city with is witchy mom and scary cat. Yeah, this guy reminded me of someone I know from TV... Dean Winchester?Exactly. But I didn't mind. Not at all. Because I really loved this book. I really really did. It was way better then I expected. I haven't read much horror stories before. Thrillers, detectives, ... Books like that I've read. But never something like this. This book was scary, sweet, heartbreaking, gross and scary again. It made me sit at the edge of my seat clinging to my eReader. It hooked me and I couldn't shake it off. I was thinking about it when I was trying to sleep. I'll have to start reading another book and even then I'll still be thinking about it. That's how good this was. (And scary. And gross.)Come on, be honest. That's enough to make a person curious about the book and that's just one sentence! This book starts of with a bang. A scary and gross bang, but still a bang. It had my attention immediately. It builds up and even breaks your heart sometimes. It definitely isn't a story for the faint hearted. So if you're easily scared and don't like gross details, don't read this book because it has a lot of gross and scary parts. Seriously. Gross, scary, what-was-the-author-thinking parts. And the ending... Geesh... The ending. It broke my heart again.Now the characters. Like I said, Cas really reminded me of one Dean Winchester, but that is not a bad thing. Cas is badass, sweet, caring, funny and he isn't perfect not at all. He is insecure and scared sometimes. Of course he is. And I really love him for that. And I love his mom. She's not just another random character. She really brings something to the story and she is so cool! Oh and I have to say that I love Thomas and Carmel too. They are the first real friends Cas gets in his life and I really like them. They too, mean something in this story. I love this book for that. No characters just to fill up gaps. Every character means something!And yes, I'm going to talk about her to. Anna. Anna dressed in blood. I'm not going to give away anything about her story, you'll have to read the book for that. But it broke my heart. I love Anna and I feel sorry for what happened to her, even tough I had nothing to do with it and it didn't even really happen.So if you love these kinds of books, you'll certainly love this one. If you're still not sure wether or not to read it, I'd give it a try if I were you. It's worth it. It really is."
"Short review for a pretty short book.Even though the idea of this book was something that I quite liked, the book itself didn't do it for me. The writing wasn't great, not good enough to suck me into the story. And the main character was a bit annoying. I'm sorry, but this book is not as good as I hoped it to be. Allison acted way to hard-to-get with Ethan, which was the main thing that annoyed me about her and I just didn't get any feels in this book. (That's a must for me. I need the feels.)The concept of the Danaans, the fairies from Ireland, was interesting and for that I give the book credit because it's the only thing that made the book good. But for the rest, it just wasn't for me. Sorry!"
"3.5 starsThis book was better than I expected. Yeah, the fact that it's about elemental powers has something to do with it and the fact that the main character has the power of my favorite element, fire, has a lot to do with it, but it was just a good book overall.Yeah, I think this review will be a bit short, but I don't have a lot to say about it, so. And it's not a bad thing! The story was good, the writing was good, the romance was good. It was just a good solid book! And yeah, pretty original too. And I'm happy the author gave me a chance to read it. I loved the world she build in this book and how she handled the paranormal stuff in it. Yeah, elemental powers are a weakness of mine, so it was hard to not like this book. But if it wasn't that good, I would've been honest about it. Not everyone can get it right, but Jessie did.I liked the characters, they were pretty well-developed and I liked most of them. Kiarra is cool, with the power of fire and all that. Wish I was her. Or rather, wish I had her power. Jaxton was.... yum first of all. He was cool and I loved getting to know him. And I loved Neena too. Again, all of the characters were great. And I can't wait to see what happens next, what their new adventure is.The book is the start of a new series and I'm pretty excited about it. I want to know what happens next! So yeah, I liked the book and I'm going to read the next books in the series."
"Wow. I just have no words. I've been sitting here for a few minutes, thinking about what I was going to say in my review. Still have nothing, so I'm just going to ramble a bit and sometimes these kinds of reviews are the most fun to read. But I did love this book. A lot. And it might just have a place in my top 14 of this year already.First of all, this is such an original story. I'm not going to give a summary because of what I just said. My thoughts are all jumbled up and I can't get them straight so. But the main character is pretty cool. The story is cool and the idea of The Archive is so original. I was sucked in from the first page and I just read it pretty much in one sitting (with some breaks here and there). There are two kinds of narrations, both Mackenzie. One is just the present and the other is I think the past. It's like her diary to her dead grandfather who learned her all about the Archive and all that stuff. It was pretty cool and it wasn't annoying, it really helped the story along. There is a bit of a romance, but it's secondary and I loved that. And it wasn't really a big romance. It was nice because there was a lot going on for Mackenzie and she has more important stuff to do.I really liked the characters in this book. They were all important to the story and I wanted to know more about them. I just... I was sucked into that world with those people and the mystery in it all. Mackenzie is a great main character. I loved her. And I felt for her. I also loved Wesley, he's cool and awesome. I'm not going to say to much about the other ones, but they were all great and I loved them all. There is something wrong in the Archive and it's someone in the inside that does bad things and I suspected someone the whole time but in the end I was wrong and I like that. It wasn't predictable. God I'm really jumping from one thing to another here.I'll sum it all up by just saying that it's really good, I'm going to buy the hardback copy of it next month because it's just that great (and duhh, cover love!) and I can't wait to read the sequel. I'd recommend this book to people who loved Anna Dressed in Blood or even the TV-show Supernatural (first season). It's really original and definitely a must-read for fans of the YA Paranormal genre. Schwab, you've got a new fan!"
"Wow. This story was... Yeesh... It was great! It was romantic, dramatic, and hot. Yeah, seriously hot.In this book we meet Erin at a very hard time in her life. The first chapter, the prologue gave me tears in my eyes already. And then suddenly we're a few years later and Erin has promised herself not to love again in order not to get hurt again. Makes sense, right? I thought so. Love can be a bitch. But she didn't expect to meet Alek, who turns her world upside down and tries to break down the wall she build around herself.The story started out good, as I already said. But the first two chapters after the prologue didn't really get my attention and I was easily distracted from the book. That changed when I started chapter 3 and the story began to get more and more interesting every page I turned. The double POV really helped in that. It made the story better and it got to me more and more every chapter.The relationship isn't rushed and that is a very good thing. It's not an instant love kinda thing. It builds and grows as the story goes along and I loved that. When I was about 70% into the story, I got a feeling what was going to happen and I didn't want to be right, but I was and I was crying and sobbing and then the end came and I was crying happy tears. So it's an understatement when I say this book is an emotional roller coaster.I really liked Erin. She had a tough time when she was young and that made her shy away from anything new and avoids love at all cost because she doesn't want to get hurt. So when she meets Alek, she kind of tries to avoid him because he is a huge new thing. (A delicious and handsome one at that.) She doesn't want that in her perfectly organised life. But she opens up to him and grows. And I loved her in the end. Alek was... omg Alek. He's yummy. He has issues and a past but he also grows and opens up to Erin. They help each other and learn each other how to love again and that was one of the best things in this book in my opinion.I hated Lila, by the way. God what a *beeeeep*.So Kas, I really really REALLY loved your book and I hope I get more of Erin and Alek in the future? Or anything else from you in this genre is fine too.This review will also be on Goodreads, my blog and Barnes &amp; Noble."
"2.5 starsWell... I'm sad to say this but I'm so happy I finished this book because I didn't think I'd make it through it. I didn't like it that much. There were some good elements, but for the most part I was frustrated, annoyed and bored. And I'll explain why.This book is about Hailey. Hailey has been famous and in the spotlight for as long as she can remember. But she's getting tired off all that. So she's going to college. Start over. But that's easier said than done. Classes are harder than she thought they'd be and her mother is determined to ruin her life because of her choice to leave Hollywood. And there's Caleb Fox, the guy she never expected. He doesn't want her for her fame, he just wants her. And Hailey isn't sure if she can give him what he wants. And what if he finds out the one secret the tabloids don't know yet? Will he still be there?First the bad things. Get it over with.1) I didn't like the writing that much. It was pretty simple and there were a lot of cliche things in the story. And some of the things the characters said were just... No. Just no. I can compare it to the writing in Fifty Shades. Not exactly the best I've ever seen.2) Hailey was SO annoying! Most of the time I was thinking: `Why do you have to be that way? Seriously! Why???' Whenever someone wants to be friends with her, she immediately thinks they want that because they're famous. Yeesh. And when she walks into a room at school she's like: `Oh hey nobody stops and stares. That's weird.' Again... No. Just no. On top of that, in the blurb they mention some secret and I thought it would be something big that would make the story a whole lot better but when I read what it was... I was banging my head against the table. Such a stupid stupid thing. Why would anybody hate you for that? It's not like you're the only one in the world to have done that. Seriously. NO. That's all I'm going to say about her for now.3) The insta-love. Well not really love but they do have an instant attraction to each other and even before talking to each other, they NEED to have the other person. They just NEED to kiss and all that. Yeah... Also a no for me.Now the good.1) I actually liked Caleb. He was a sweet guy and cares for Hailey (even though I wouldn't understand why...) And I liked most of the other characters too. Griff may be my soulmate.2) The story itself wasn't that bad. If the writing had been better, I probably would have liked the book a lot more. And Hailey too.Okay that's it for this review. I'm sorry I didn't like it, but hey that's the way it is sometimes."
"What's up with the dystopian novels these days? Almost every single one I've read in the last month were great. I've read some bad ones in the past and lost hope a little for the genre, but David Estes' The Moon Dwellers gave me hope again and since then, my hope grew and I can now officially say that I love this genre once again. And this book was no different. I really liked it!Two Thirds of the world's population is wiped out after the worst war ever seen on the planet Earth. One of the survivors is Charlotte, a girl that can read minds. After losing her family, the New World leader takes her with him and soon she becomes his secret weapon. Her job is to make sure the rebels stay down, where they belong. Until one of them sneaks past her defences and makes her feel things she never felt before. But will this love save them or end them?I don't know why I've read anything by Janelle before. I mean... I wanted too, but never got it. I even won a copy of Eden in a giveaway a few weeks ago. I just didn't get to it I guess. But I will soon, because I love her! She's a great writer and I love her style. I'm normally not a big fan of writing in first person, but I didn't really mind in this book. But it is one of two the things that kept this book from being 5 stars. The second one being the fact that the double POV was a bit confusing in the beginning. I was really invested in the first one, Charlotte's, and then it switches to another person. And it's because of that first person writing, that it was so confusing. But that's really the only bad thing I can say about this book. I love the way Janelle created the world the story takes place in and I just love Janelle. Next to talented, she's also a very sweet and nice woman.I like the characters too. Charlotte is pretty badass. I'm sure she can kick some ass if she needs to. Yeah, she's beautiful, but they don't really use that as a weapon. She has to wear a mask to keep the fact that she's a girl a secret, so that's another thing I liked. She grows a lot in this book and even though she is a badass heroine, she's still vulnerable. That makes her human and relatable.I liked Pete too and Ramon and Ludwig and all the other characters, but Charlotte's my favorite, so.I am going to read the sequel when it's out and I definitely recommend it to everyone who loves dystopian novels."
"A great read for every parent of a college bound student.  Too often, parents have blinders on - they really don't want to know what college is going to cost.  Dr. Ronstadt shows the true cost and then many strategies to reduce it.  His sections on College Success are amazing."
"This is perfect for any car. Now, when I change my oil, I easily save 5-10 minutes. The ramps are extremely light weight which is great for handling and storage purposes. Product quality is awesome!"
"The filter and o ring fit perfectly in the aluminum canister. Great product, great price! I will definitely buy again."
"Great gameplay an story, if you're a fan of the comic, this game is great, once I started playing I couldn't stop"
"Awesome game, if you love superheroes, keeps me busy when I'm bored an my 6 year old likes playing it"
"It works very good! Dropped it a couple of times already &amp; it keeps my phone safe! Satisfied my needs"
"Are you tired of your life? Do exactly the same Mondays and other days of the week don't make sense to you? Do you feel that there is something more waiting in life for you? If you have such or similar questions I believe this book can be an answer for you! But just reading it and not practicing is not going to make any changes in your life!This book is sequel to Robin's bestseller The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. Basically it's very similar to the mentioned book, but everything is expanded and explained in more details. The plot is simple, the same monk who sold his Ferrari is sharing his wisdom with the man who has everything in life, but lost meaning of it. He almost ended with a suicide, but accidentally something stopped him and that something became a breakthrough in his life.What I like in this book is that Sharma takes us step by step through all 7 steps of self-awakening. In a story telling way he explains us why they are important and how you can master them. He gives us many advices and insights that can help to transform anyone's life. To make those steps and advises more emphasized the hero of the books teaches his apprentice one step at a time, by showing a lesson each time and making him to experience everything by himself, not just to hear the advice. That makes this book more practical to use for everyone who want great changes in their lives.I believe there are many lost souls in this world and this practical book can really help to find a real yourself and a real meaning of your life. Even if this one book won't help, I believe it will be a first huge step to discover your destiny!So, is your next Monday going to be the same as your last 30 Mondays?!"
"Amazingly shocking and mind-blowing! Masterpiece that you won't forget for a long time! Very futuristic look at the utopian society, technologies and lifestyle. This book really blow me away! It immediately became my favorite novel I've ever read.Brave New World takes us to a very far future, even though it was written about 80 year ago. Aldous Huxley really made a fantastic work, which I was so much surprised and amazed to read. This book got my attention from the start and I couldn't put it away till the end. Life and society are much different in Brave New World. They live by different mindset, values, purpose and meaning than we do in today world (or it just might look like so from the first sight). Everything is based on the idea that everyone belongs to everyone else and happiness is the main priority which should be gotten right now.First of all, people are born artificially and divided into the groups. There are 5 castes in New World's society: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon. You might understand that alphas are the highest and epsilons are the lowest caste. The main beauty of that is that all society lives in peace and happiness and that is achieved by shaping mindset from the embryo. So everybody is happy at their positions and never thinks about any other opportunities. Artificial drug helps everyone always be happy despite any bad situations. There are no relationships, families or any other factors that might disturb the order. There it is vulgar and unethical to have only one partner.Such life might seem very amoral for many people, but as I said before it just seems different and unacceptable for our world. As I wrote in my previous review about 1984's, it's just a mask, matrix. Look deeper and you will see that our society is not much different. Starting from marriages, most people do that and it's almost never permanent not even including cheats on partners (I mean that cheating is end of the marriage already). Agree? You should. Furthermore, let's take castes. In our world most people think that they have a choice. The true is they don't. Yes, actually everyone has a choice, theoretically, but practically not. Just take an example of riches's children becoming rich and broke's children becoming broke. It's not because of any other conditions or circumstances, but the programming parent's give to their children. So here we have a choice, but everything starts from teacher giving right lessons to the student. So, if you have a successful mindset, you will pass it on through many generations and will get alphas. If not, you will get epsilon generations. I don't want to be mean, just trying to get your attention that everything is possible you just need to start from yourself and there is no time for laziness or any excuses. Let's take one more aspect from the book, like ""I want now and here to get and be happy"". What can you say about our society? It's mostly the same. Most people do something small or worthless now to satisfy some needs not thinking much about the result in the future. I hear a lot ""I want this now, I need this now"" and something really important and meaningful or valuable they delay for a lifetime. The typical culture of consumerism and ""fast food"" (fast life). And I don't mean that it's bad, I mean that everything could be used in a good way and in a bad way. You choose!One more interesting aspect for me is the governance of the society in New World. There should always be a cowboy to supervise the herd. The role of the cowboy in this book goes to world governors. There are just couple of them who supervise all the world. They are the creators of everything and the interesting part of it, that in order to become one of them you should get out of the rat race! But before that you have to realize that there is a rat race. One of them told his story, that when he realized there is more in life, had a choice to go to the island or to train and become one of the world's governors. And the island is the place for people who want to create, explore and escape from the society they are in. All of this is just one more example to see that our world is the same. Most people are so busy with their day-to-day routines that they never realize there must be more in this life. I must say WAKE UP!!!Lastly I would like to look over technologies operating in the New World. It really surprised me that the author who wrote this book in 1931 had so futuristic vision. Mass production cloning, sleep learning, flying cars, artificial drugs with no bad feeling really surprised me.So are you alpha or epsilon? But the main question in not ""what"" you are, it's who you are willing to become!"
"Involving till the last word. Beautifully designed dystopic world, which rises a lot of questions about human existence and purpose in this world.Big brother is watching you!""1984"" is classic novel by George Orwell written in 1949. For me it was very interesting to see how author sees the future (as I know now it's the past), and as the world shown in the book is totalitarian that means no much technology or life development or improvement can be expected. The most interesting technology for me was an all seeing eye, a screen in every place, which is watching every move of every person.The book shows the world after some nuclear war. There are just three countries in that world and they are always fighting. The described country is called Oceania. Winston Smith is the main character of the story. He is working to rewrite/correct the history of the world. The past is rewritten every day, because the system (Big Brother) must be always right. The world without the past or future and without any meaning. People are doing everyday work without even realizing why they are doing that.I liked ""1984"" because it was involving till the end. Even though the time author wrote this novel was the time when all kind of ideological systems were developing, it's still very interesting to see one of the most ridiculous version of them. I was born in Lithuania, where we had the system of communism, but I don't remember much of that because I was too little. But after reading this book it's easier for me to understand older generation, because they were part of that system. So probably they experienced many things written in the book and the consequences of all that are still influencing their lives.On the other hand, as I was reading the book I was thinking, even if that world seems so cruel and ridiculous through my eyes, could it be that we are living in the same world right now? No, not the same from the outside world, but the same from the inner ourselves. The values of the Oceania were: war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength. If we take the second one and try it on today's society, I could say that most people don't like to be free. They are looking forward to being enslaved in jobs they don't like and activities that doesn't make any sense also being scared to get fired, because it means that they will have to use their brains to find or start something new. The third value is also very common among nowadays society. As I wrote in my previous post, most people simply ignore the information and feel good about that. The book is very worth reading!So, do we really live in a different world? What do you think?"
"Is Bill Gates who he is today because of the talent he has? Was Steve Jobs such a legendary creator because of his own persistence and visions? That's a good question that Malcolm Gladwell tries to explain in this book based on the opportunities and heritage they had in life. I have a little different opinion or maybe just an addition to his opinion what I think is very important as well!Outliers is the book about success. It's not another success story or a guide how to become successful, even though, after reading such book you can know more about success than you did before. It's a book with a lot of examples and experiments that were carried out trying to identify why some people are successful and some are not. Author tries to go deep into the surroundings that famous and successful people like Bill Gates, The Beatles, Joe Flom and others had in life. Malcolm makes an assumption that no one became successful by themselves, that the heritage and the society made those people into success stories they are. The book is full of experiments and explorations deep into those people lives, which sometimes take many generations before they were born. Author also gives us many statistics, to illustrate some of the facts about successful and not so successful people.What is more different in this book, that everything is explained based on the sequence of lucky opportunities that happened to those famous people. It's like, because of that it happened this and because of this there was a good time or personal character to do something. And like I mentioned before, sometimes it goes deep into many generations before. It might be true and I can't say contrary. Anyway, author agrees that to be successful you have to have certain character features and certain time to use opportunity. That's absolutely true. It's like starting to make a wagon for horse these days is absolute insanity when we are talking about the future of flying cars. But some time ago it was a chance. The same with character, of course you need to have certain features to become successful and author mostly says about why some people have one and other people have other features based on their background and life style. And the conclusion comes that some of them become successful and some don't.Everything there is true and I believe that couple hundred years ago not everybody had so much chances to become successful as we have now. Today really everything is possible and it doesn't depend on any character or background in the end. Yes, it depends at the start point, but the beauty of this is that we can change habits and character, because we have the information that it's possible and moreover we have methods and practices how to do so. It's possible to forgive person when he doesn't know something but it's not fair to do so when he knows the information but doesn't use it. And it's a choice to use or not, but the fact that we have it still remains. So every choice has a consequences and that's also known!Another ingredient to success story in Malcolm's book is opportunity. He talks about the opportunities that those successful people had. He admits that they were ready when the opportunity came, because they made right actions before. I agree one hundred percent with him too - you have to be ready to take an opportunity when it comes to you. And again, the beautiful thing in today world is that opportunities come very often. The problem is that most people don't see them because they are not ready or are too busy with their day-to-day routine. And to be ready is a choice of how you spend you time. Everyone has 24 hours a day, so it's just a choice what will you do during that time. Moreover, today it's possible to take or create an opportunity yourself as information is very easy accessible and everybody knows it!Considering everything that was said, it's a great book, which will help you to see success stories from a different angle. I believe it will help you to see what choices and surrounding can help you reach your goals and which won't. And as I mentioned before, the beautiful thing is that you can change and adapt yourself to become who you really want to be!So what is stopping you from success? Do you see many opportunities in life? Does your character help you?"
"I always hear people complaining about not having enough money, about having debts and how they can't do anything because of that. I'm really sorry for those people, because the biggest debt is in their heads. And the worst is that after reading this book most of them won't change anything. So for those, don't bother, skip this review and this book. But for those, who want to see what a really top class lifestyle and business means - there are 5 billion of reasons to read this book!Donald Trump is a great man. This is not the first book of his that I've got to read. He is one of those people I really admire and I believe everyone can learn a lot from this star of success.I really loved this book. First of all, it's not a tutorial on becoming rich. There is no magic or mystic in this ability. There are just certain things that can lead you to be successful and some that will never do. You choose that! Donald is the believer of hard work. I like this point of view, because nothing comes in easy way. You should understand that while reading this book.Honestly, I didn't learn anything about success from this book. Everything Trump says about success I've already read in other books. As I mentioned before, there are certain things that bring people to the dream life. All successful people use them and talk about them in their books. Just all of them do that in their own manner and from their own point of view. What I love about Donald is his point of view, how he does that.Some people might think that Trump is always praising himself. It might seem like that, but the main thing is that when you came back to the fortune from the debt of almost 10 billion dollars, you have a right to do so. Moreover, when you are creating the top class things, it's another reason to really be proud of yourself. I bet most people who say bad things about Trump are really low class and champions of excuses.Adding more to my fascination about this book, is that I saw all the greatness of creating a world-top-class buildings and other facilities. One thing is to build a small 2 floor building, another is to build a huge and marvelous skyscraper, not even talking about the quality of living inside.In one of the chapters the author describes his work week, hour by hour. It might look stupid, but if you look deeper, you will understand how successful people live and what they do (and what don't - that's very important too!). So after reading this chapter you can compare Trump's week with your week. If you are a billionaire, I believe that it will be pretty much the same. If not? You have where to improve..So, do you choose to live a top class life?"
"Simple story, simple examples and outstanding knowledge that will definitely improve your financial success and life! Rich Dad Poor Dad will uncover the non-hidden secrets of why some people are becoming rich and most are not. And the most beautiful thing is that you will be able to use that knowledge and become rich as well!Robert Kiyosaki is a wonderful adviser regarding financial issues. Rich Dad Poor Dad is his must have book in any home, because it will definitely improve your financial situation. I believe you will find many answers to the question why you are not rich yet. Robert tells his story of having 2 dads, one who was his intelligent one and the other, who was the rich one. The story starts from the childhood and I believe it's very important, because the knowledge you get being a child lasts through mostly all your life. And here comes very important question of what outcome do you wish to have in your life? This book is a great start of changing your mindset and start living a rich life!I've read this book twice and I think I will read it once a year, because even though some of the information is a little old or not as useful in different countries as it is in US, still the principles and the ideas are exactly the same. Every time reading this book I'm getting a little bit different understanding of what Robert wants to tell us, so I believe reading it once a year will still give me a very valuable new insights.What I love about this book is that it really explains differences between people's mindsets and how those mindsets are affecting their financial life. Mostly if the financial situation is bad, that leads to all other aspects of life to be bad. So by reading this book you will be able to understand the main principles why some people are rich and most are not. Another great thing is that Kiyosaki advocates education a lot. And by saying education he means not the education system, but the education itself, what means constant improvement of you. He really doesn't like the system that is used in many countries to produce just employees, without any knowledge of financial issues and any chance of becoming really rich! And yes, many people are still blindly following the habit, that you need to go to school an get a good education. It's time to wake up, because we are living in different times!And some WARNING at the end: This book won't make you rich - you will! This book will just give you the knowledge how to do that!So, are you ready to wake up, or you need to get your diploma first?"
"Launching a leadership revolution is one of the books I just finished reading this month. I have to admit I really needed it and I believe everyone who is leading somebody or wants to lead must read this great book.Two amazing authors Chris Brady and Orrin Woodward gives us an incredible opportunity to learn from their experience on leadership. One of them, Chris Brady, I met in live event about a year ago. I can say that this man is an amazing speaker, who made a big impact on me. So getting to read the book he co-authors was a great opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge in leadership mastery.I like it very much that everything is very clear. All leadership mastery is distinguished in smaller parts and it's very easy to determine which part you are in. Knowing this it is very easy to understand where you need to improve and what is the next step. Authors call this the five levels of influence and they gives you step-by-step instructions what you need in everyone of them, so it's very easy to see where exactly you need to improve and what exactly you need to do to master every level. Examples of the real people in every level of influence made this book really attractive for me.Launching a leadership revolution really helped me to understand which areas I need to improve and gave me the guidance what exactly should I do. That's why I think that it is really great book for everyone who wants to master the art of leadership. I think this book will help everyone despite of which level of leadership you are in, because a real leader always has where to improve."
"Dale Carnegie - the master of success! This book is one of his most popular books which had really changed many lives. One of the most important skills to reach your goals is probably communication and Carnegie beautifully reveals the secrets of this great skill. If you read this book and implement it, I believe your life will change to a great adventure!I've read this book twice and going to read it couple more times in the future. It's a book about one of the key skills in becoming successful. Human communication plays a main role in every situation including relationships, business, making friends, learning, creating and probably all other spheres of life. So mastering such a skill is extremely important in life and this book can teach you to do so.I love this book because everything is very easy presented and explained based on examples of real life people. Those secrets seem to be not secrets at all. All of you know them and might be using some of them sometimes not even realizing that if mastered and used properly it could change your life for better forever. You don't need to learn nothing new, everything what you need is to read this book carefully and implement those lessons step by step until it will become your second nature.I recommend this book for everybody despite who you are or how many and how good friends do you have. If you already mastered necessary skills of communication, it will be just a check that you are already a master of communication. But if not, you will discover a new life.Tell me your new life story after reading this book! Or maybe you have any other great suggestion?"
"Ever wanted a Ferrari? This book will help you get one, later on, it's your choice what to do with it!Robin Sharma shares his advises again. This book is a sequential book to the precursor The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. I can't say that it's better or worse than the first book, because it's quite different. Different in style, not in the primary meaning. This book is not written in a story style, it's more step by step tutorial  and all advises are distinguished and explained one by one. And because of this style, I believe that this book is very clearly and easy understandable. Stories are important as well and they help us to realize things easier, but after stories it's always a good thing to have a step by step guide, which will remind us the most important lessons.What I liked in this book is that author really emphasizes that money is not a bad thing and it helps you reach your dreams easier. I believe this is very important, because as I mentioned after reading The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, some people might get an idea that you don't need money in life. And that's not correct. So in this book author explicitly mentions that money is important, just you don't need to make everything only about money.I really encourage you to grab this book, read it and try it! That's very important, because sometimes we have the knowledge, but the only way to benefit from that is to put it in action!Waiting for your thoughts, share your experience while reading this book!"
"Change your mindset, change your life. Change your living place, change your..hmm..My interpretation of this story!Russell Conwell wrote this book/story more than 100 years ago. It's one of the stories that started a self-help era of literature. The book was born after many lectures told by the author himself. The story is short and the main idea is that if you want to be happy and successful you should look for that where you are. Russell talks mostly about people or emigrants who leaves their home and searches for the happiness somewhere else.I've read this book twice, but still can't understand it exactly. I have just my own interpretation. I don't think that you should understand everything word by word, it might be dangerous. I am cosmopolitan myself, and I look at the whole world as my home. Not the country, not the city. Maybe times changed and the world became smaller (in the meaning that today we can reach any corner of the world in some hours or talk to a person anywhere in some seconds), but I personally don't believe that we should stick to the place we were born at. I believe we have a choice where to be and where to live despite of the fact where we were born. I agree with the author on the idea that it's possible to be happy and make a success in any place where you are and you don't need to look for that somewhere else, but sometimes you just want to experience the world and find some other place to live and to be happier.My interpretation is that acres of diamonds is your mind and your mindset. I think that you should change it first to be happy and successful, because if you just change the place and your mindset will stay the same, nothing really good will happen in your life. You must look into your acres of diamonds first to find the treasures held in you. Of course, changes in life, living place, country or other circumstances sometimes help you to change your mindset easier and to discover you acres of diamonds, but still it's the first thing you should deal with. And this book is one of those which will help you to change your mindset!Do you have any other interpretation of this story?!"
"Very good science fiction movie, with beautiful effects and great acting! Of course, many scenes were made with a lot of help of computer and graphics, but that's the beauty of using the technology to create something great. I personally expected some more deep story line. For me it was similar like The Matrix. Just in The Matrix human's don't even realize there was a war and in Oblivion they believe they have won the war but they have to leave..One of the things that really mesmerised me was the house where the main characters were living. Amazing house with even more amazing pool. I wish to have such living place for myself:)This movie raised me a question about what we believe to be true. Do we really know that something is true or we are just taking the things other people or authorities are telling us and considering them to be true? As you'll see in the movie, there is no true, there is just a created reality we are living in. Even though the scenes in the movie are science fictional, the concept of human life is a reality which is happening around you every day just in different forms."
"I always was a fan of X-Men movies and Wolverine is my favorite character there, so I was very excited to watch this movie. Great fighting scenes, great acting and directing of the movie made it really very involving and interesting till the end. Moreover the end was really unexpected, it seemed that already everything is obvious, but it wasn't. Special effects are always a necessary part of X-Men movies and this time they are not the exception - they were great! Impatiently waiting for the next part."
"Steve Jobs is my favorite personality. I was very excited when I found out that there is going to be a movie about him. Of course, I read the book about Steve some time ago before the movie was released. So, after reading the book firstly, the movie didn't make me a big impression. I was absolutely obsessed by the book and compared to this, the movie was just OK. I admit, that Kutcher's acting and directing of the movie is great, but the story itself is missing the thrill which you get from the book. When I was reading the book, sometimes I got the shiver by reading things described in the book (mostly the achievements of Steve). I didn't feel anything similar in the movie.I don't want to say, that the movie is not worth watching. Yes it is. But just one time. If you haven't read the book yet, then I greatly recommend you to watch the movie first and read the book afterward. If you are choosing between the book and the movie - choose book. You will never regret!"
"Stunning views and huge money thriller. Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake did a great job. Both characters are very well fitted into the movie. I liked Runner Runner from the start till the end, because it's easy watching movie with a lot of amazing views, luxury things, big dreams, great lifestyle and involving plot. This movie has a little everything, like drama, romance, action, fun, betrayal, crime and thriller. Such movies help me to dream build, because that's why I like them. I believe you won't be disappointed after watching this movie.What can you learn from this movie? It's that everybody has a weakness. Find it and you will own the deal! It's very important in life, because everyday we are making some kind of business or negotiations. Another thing that can be learnt from this movie is to dream big and play big. Of course, the bigger the dream, the bigger the risk, but there is no other way. I'm not talking about gambling or other games. I'm talking about any kind of dreams that you might have."
"Stress is a usual thing in our lives. Some kind of it might be good and some very bad. It's important to know when stress can help you to progress and when it can harm you.If you don't know anything about stress this book will give you the basic knowledge of what it is. It's like a simple tutorial or an info brochure on this topic, but not a book. What I didn't like about it is that there is not much information on the ways to reduce stress. As the topic says this book should help you to reduce stress and for me it seems that it just gives some information on how to do that. I expect more deep analysis and information from such book.The good thing is that it's short and if you don't know anything about stress you can read this info in one hour. On the other hand, you can find all this info and more in Wikipedia of simply internet, using search keywords &amp;#34;ways to reduce stress&amp;#34;.Wish you a healthy life without stress!"
"One of the things in life I really value it's my TIME and this movie really wasted it! Of course, the acting is great, because of the talent and skills actors put in this movie. It's their job, so it is obvious that they do their best in whatever movie it might be. Why I didn't like this movie? Because it's nothing new, funny, worth telling others or worth using any lessons from the movie. The story line is very weak and worthless. On the other hand I should admit that directing of the movie is not bad, it's very good. My judgement of this movie is not based on the movie itself. I always like to see something valuable in the movie apart the movie creation itself. There was a time in my life when I was watching a lot of movies and then I decided that it's enough to waste my time watching other people's lives. For me it's not enough just to watch the movie, I want to take something away for myself. And The Family falls to that category of movies, which is well build, but it's just pictures with no lasting value."
"I am enjoying playing this game and it is lots of fun! I have had my kindle for a year and just now realized I can play games"
"Full of detail filling in the gaps from the French &amp; Indian War to the beginning 0f the Revolution. Lots of interesting facts and character studies. Gives great insight into the uncertainty of the Patriot cause."
"defective product which made a huge mess after installed. After installed, turned water on and it blew the handle off all the way to the ceiling, made my husband fall, soaked the walls, ceiling, runied stuff in my bathroom including my expensive blow dryer which got soaked inside so can no longer be used. We needed the faucet replaced for my son's 1st birthday party tomorrow and now the guest have no bathroom to wash their hands in. It's cheaply made and the part the bolt to the handle screws into is made of plastic and is stripped which is what caused the handle to blow off with such force. We got soaked in just seconds. I want a refund"

"Winslow Homer's famous painting, Snap the Whip, portrays boys playing a game that was popular with kids over 100 years ago. In this book for kids Gatsby the cat has the magical ability to jump into paintings at night. But if he doesn't get back into his own world before dawn, the art will be changed and that's what happens in Snap the Whip. Gatsby tries several times to return into the painting and correct the changes that happened because of his visits, but keeps being delayed by his adventures until it's too late.The author, Barbara Cairns, does a wonderful job of getting kids interested in this famous work of art and young readers from seven to twelve years old will enjoy the book. There's interesting information about the Winslow Homer that can be used in school reports at the end.The illustrations by Eugene Ruble add to the charm and will encourage younger kids to enjoy hearing the story read aloud.I have a feeling Gatsby's Grand Adventures is only the first book about this magical cat."
"My daughter is 5 years old and weighs about 56 pounds and probably 46 inch. tall. She usually wears a size 6X or 7. They fit her well. I bought her mediums hoping they would be a little big so she could wear them a little longer. They fit loosely, which is what I wanted and they are a little longer than her belt line. The material is a little thin, but they are perfect undershirts."
"I got these for my 5 year old girls. They are both in shoe size 1 1/2. The material is not too thin or too thick. I believe they will hold up for a while. My girls say they are comfortable and the fit is great. I would recommend these."

"I like the color blue, but the color is not same in the photoit is beatiful and practice.  Good"
"Too many table runs cheated out of! Its obvious that the game is designed to let both players shoot 99% of games. The computer would change how far balls would roll and leave you hooked 1-2 balls before the 8 ball. I used a clear ruler to extend my guidelines to the center of pockets and object ball would hit down on rail and then rattle pocket. I understand its supposed to be fun but very unrealistic. Ive been shooting pool everyday for 25 years and I can assure you I dont have to always power the cue ball to draw it back. Also, the way the english works on the game is in no way shape or form realistic. I played to level 18 then uninstalled the game. Just because people are level 78 didnt mean they should be given a chance to shoot because I was a lower level. In real life most people don't get to shoot if I pocket a ball on the break. Someone with some knowledge of the game should have designed it."
"I love it it tells me how much battery I have :) I carry my kindle every where I go I love it I just like seeing the percent"
"For someone who tends to forget strokes, this is a handy gadget.  If only I could get it to swing for me too, then it would really be 5 star"

"I like the loose leaf version on this text book. It's convienent to bring the sections I need to class, and avoid carryig around too many heavy books. This text book arrived in a timely manner, it was in great condition and I was able to save money by avoiding the book store on campus."
"Great Book.  Have just begun reading this with my wife and find it a very informative, helpful book.  Arrived on time intact.  Thank You.  Bill W."
"just one thing: it is not always very easy to do quick if you want something in the ruckbag, it is better to do it on a table... it is a very strong and nice bag, perhaps the most convenient bag i have always been looking for many years!"
"My daughters and I love these songs.  They are fun to sing along with.  We have enjoyed this music!  &amp;#34;Give,&amp;#34; Said the Little Stream is a particular favorite."

"I loved this book, especially because I was raised within a couple miles of this boy's grandparents' home. His is a unique perspective and I related to his story in many ways. It is a good read for anyone regardless of where they grew up."
"This is a history book written about a very challenging period due to lack of research materials. As such, it is the most pleasantly written style I have ever read. I actually prefer well-researched historical novels for ease of reading, however this was about as close as you can get for enjoyable education. I have now ordered and look forward to reading the second volume."
"Whether Swedish or not, anyone who had ancestors who immigrated to the US or Canada in the mid 1850's will find this series of books eye-opening and will give them a new respect for those who came to this &amp;#34;mysterious&amp;#34; new land."

"Goes against everything that nutritionists have learned in the past 75 years.From personal experience very minimal amounts of dairy and meats (preferably none at all) with the diet of vegetables, fruits, nuts,berries and seeds leaves me healthier and livelier feelingAlso forgot to mention that the lifespan of man up until modern day was much less and that disease was much more prominent with earlier man.Man still doesn't have the digestive tract for meat and dairy from animals."
"Outfit skirt must have been made for a Barbie.  Skirt way too tight around the waist,  and the suspenders must be for those extremely large breasted (with an extremely tiny waist and hips.)  not for an average woman.  Definitely not one size fits most  Very disappointed,  because it's a very cute and sent"
"Great for a family of all ages.  The music is fun.  Get as many people together and you will have a blast."
"I did not have to do any trimming the little that was left length wise, I just wrapped it underneath and it stays.  The color is decent a bit off from my other appliances, but it works very well, as I did not want to see a white dishwasher, nor was I in the market to purchase another one at this time."
"Easy connection, works great for talking as well as listening to my music.  I really enjoy the ability to listen to music with the additional attachment"

"Install the app played it once and now it doesn't want to open.  Tried several different times and days to see if it would open. No luck."
"This kindle is great. I hardly ever use my home computer since I got this. You can use it anywhere in the house. I use it mainly to check e-mail, surfing the net , games and music. It's a great product. I also like this size easy to take with you."
"this is just like the original game you get in the box.one or more people can play. I like it."

"These shoes claim to stretch and I am hoping that they do as far as the top seam is concerned.  So far they are cutting into the top of my foot and are not all that comfortable.They look okay but not as good as I had hoped.  Not likely to purchase this style again."
"These are the best shoes that I have purchased ever.  They wear well and are so comfortable.  I usually have pain on the bottom of the foot but not with these shoes.  I have to get more colors!  Highly recommend for anyone with sore feet.  These are just too good to be true."

"Works well enough. Just can't seem to figure out how to tighten the knob that keeps it from moving up and down so easily. Maybe it's just me though."

"I bought this collection for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it. I scored some major brownie points with this gift. lol"
"These keyblade pendants are just breathtaking! The ones I received are exactly like the picture except the velvet in my box was red. The box came in fairly decent condition, but the pendants were in perfect shape and they're a good size. I couldn't even see the cast-line for them and all of them seem pretty sturdy to me. You do need to get loops for them because the keyhole (XD) is pretty small, and even if you did find a small chain, they would hang sideways. Even with the task of having to buy loops for them, I think these are still very much worth their price. I've worn all of them once but Diamond Dust, Three Wishes and Oathkeeper (Only because I associate certain days and moods with them and haven't gotten around to those yet). Oh, Spellbinder is the wrong color as shown, it's supposed to be blue, but I actually like it better in red. It almost reminds me of Halloween Town.So overall, these are pretty amazing. I'm often so captivated by them that I just sit and look at them.  I love Kingdom Hearts, so these were a must, but they're still &amp;#34;pretty pendants&amp;#34; according to my friends who haven't played any games in the series. The keyblades are high-quality, a brilliant silver color (okay, Spellbinder is red and silver),  and to die for! Where else do you think you'll find something like this? Go ahead and buy them, you know you want to! You've got to step forward to realize this wish!"
"I've had my eyes set on this necklace for months, just waiting for my birthday to buy it, and then a month afterwards. I finally placed the order and got it shipped on time, in perfect condition. Before ordering, I read some reviews and doubted they were accurate; I didn't believe the piece was so perfect. Now, every time it catches my eye, I spend 20 minutes just staring at it before I eventually put it on and then stare at it some more. The ""drops of blood"" and the red inside the heart are that perfect shade of crimson you wish you could find in a ruby. Also, I find the silver gleam of the necklace to truly stand out, it's so eye catching, and the necklace is a decent size too! Overall, I'm definitely pleased with this. In my opinion, it's a necklace like no other!"
"I like it alot, use it quite a bit but I have to watch my usage of it because I CAN'T find it in the stores around here???????That includes, Target, Walmart,HyVee, Fareway, Walgreen's. I don't know why you put a good product out then you can't buy it???My Zipcode is 50054I live in Iowa the stores I shop are within 20 mi. they include DesMoines, Altoona, Newton?? Well I got that off my Chest, if you have some laying around send me some Richard C. Horton at 9784 Hwy F-48 W. Colfax, Ia. 50054"
"I bought this product a year ago for 2 stray,somewhat feral cats who now basically live on my balcony. Though not a perfect product, it is really a good one. The cats do stay pretty warm n dry. The winters are pretty cold in the Northeast and they sleep in it every nite. I think that it's pretty waterproof. Snow has gotten on the roof and it stayed dry inside.My only gripe is that it's  really not big enough, so  I just purchased the larger size."
"Pretty good TCSM movie. Waaaaay better than the 2013 3D debacle. I really wish that this blu ray didn't have French on it underneath all the English stuff, but it plays and I guess that's all that matters."
"Forgetting for a moment that I horribly misspelled a Mary Poppins song just now, let's talk about Federation! This book is awesome! It is crafted to look like a history book (From the Next Gen era) detailing the events from Cochrine's first warp flight, to Captain Kirk's death (And possibly further, I haven't read through the whole thing yet). It has an introduction by ADMIRAL Hikaru Sulu (Not sure if actually George Takei's voice, I tried to listen closely and honestly, it's a tossup) describing the book and feeling rather honored. It comes with some cool &amp;#34;artifacts,&amp;#34; like a letter from Jim Kirk to his mother and the envelope to a bill that Zephram Cochrane wrote on (His famous, &amp;#34;Where no man has gone before&amp;#34; speech). Perhaps my favorite part is the chapters about the founding of the Federation and the Romulan War. Ya know, the stuff they WOULD have gotten to in season 5 had Star Trek Enterprise not been cancelled RIGHT before it was to start getting really good. But I digress, the book is a must have for any Trekkie. So if you guys haven't gotten it yet, get it NOW!!!!!"
"Great album! And it arrived on my birthday!!!!! I was able to blast it on my way to my family dinner which was really nice. It's a great party album, no joke. Even if most of the songs sound the same."
"Following the poorly scripted/acted/directed UniSol sequel (The Return), this movie was warmly welcomed as a proper sequel loaded with everything we loved about the original plus some new stuff. And Zod knows it was better than the fourth one."

"Dress arrived on time for daughters military ball was very wrinkled had to take it to the cleaners the to have them removed but over all the dress was Beautiful"
"The Sightron SIII has the clarity, resolution, edge-to-edge sharpness, and color accuracy to match scopes costing twice as much.  The ranging data provided with the scope makes range estimation and target sizing simple.  And the 50X magnification allows very precise aim out to 1000 yards.  The old rule applies, ""You can't hit what you can't see."", and with the Sightron SIII, seeing your target is no problem."
"These boots are the best i've ever gave as gift. That is coming from a person whom loves to give away boots (people just love them). So when i gave these to my 17 year old son, he looked at me a little weird (like really mom?). But after using them for about 3 days, he fell in love; Calling them his, ""babys"". ONE thing to take note of; is that they do run small, a whole shoe size small. My son is a size 13, i got them a size 12, and they fit him perfect."
"I thought this report was GARBAGE! You can get better,MUCH BETTER information from elsewhere.There are no ""how to' s"" and most of the things he says are just general common sense stuff that we ALL already know for the most part.Don't waste your money on this garbage!"

"It started off very good but then it started getting very boring. I did  not like the ending AT ALL. It is very simple and does not say much. It is left open. The worst part is that the sequel doesn't tell what happens next. It is just a different story. We will never know what happened to Jonah at the end..."
"It is a good game, it allows different skill levels so that you can learn and advance to become a better player"
"We bought these for our LG tv and compared the the glasses it came with these are great.  They don't look as stupid as the other glasses, both the lens and the frame are made better then the LG glasses and they fit kids and adults. My only complaint is that one pair the lens pops out when I clean them. Those were the purple ones my 3 year old called dibs on though so that may be her doing, I'm not sure."

"The suit arrived earlier than I was expecting it, so I got to wear it for the two costume parties I went to! It was a nearly perfect fit, except for the too-big arms, but I had them fixed in just a few hours. If you're in between sizes, definitely get the smaller one. The fabric is really comfortable, and I got a lot of compliments on how it looked on me. I wore it as Anne Hathaway's version of Catwoman in ""Dark Knight Rises,"" by the way, and everyone thought I looked very similar to the character.

"it's another one of these books i just dont get why people keep having to say civilization produced nothing civilization just steals from all these primitive peoples civilization is uncreativeif it is so uncreative then why do these writers keep living in it and producing these books written in western language and printed on civilized machines why not just go live in those places where indians still make their rubber right from the rubber tree and eat their peyoteand dont forget all our modern drugs just come from the indians tooi guess these writers justify themselves staying here in their electricity and gass wramed homes because they can say to themselves that gas and electricity were actaully discovered by the indians and the bushmen and the watusis and whatnotbut of course you wonder why the indians and all gave up all the modern inventions and conveiences that we indulge in but that they of course discovered. it must be because the hallucinations of peyote supply all that they need, their own virtual reality.though of course these writers would just say the indians and whatnot stopped indulging in these conveniences because civilization stole all their lands and possessions. if so, then why are these folks are striving to come up to civilization and get off their drugs and join the rest of us?"

"It's a fun game with lots of flash, color and sound. However, I have to repeatedly quit playing after just a few minutes because there is a limited number of lives.

"Recently one of our cats had started to show interest in our utility closet. Laying outside the door at night. After the second night, my husband went to investigate and found 2 mice sitting on a hammock in the closet. With me being an animal lover and vegetarian for over 20 yrs, he already knew that there was no way we were going to kill those little guys. I couldn't find any humane traps in the area, so I found this product and decided to try it. We put the traps out and have caught 3 mice in less than 24 hrs. 2 within 30 minutes tonight. I smeared a VERY thin coat (barely visible) of peanut butter in the back of the trap to lure the mice and used banana flavored instant oats for the bait. It worked perfectly! Luckily, we have a park about a mile away where we've released them with some oats. The trap is so simple to use, no need for contact with mice. Negatives to this product are: Its made with very thin plastic, and has small ventilation holes. So they need to be checked often to avoid the mice chewing their way out or suffocating. It is pricey, but well worth it."
"This radio is advertised to work for the new iPhone 5...however you have to buy an adapter for it to work. If you have the older versions than this radio will work well. Got this as a gift and had to return it due to the fact that it does NOT work with the iPhone 5 without said adapter. When I looked up the adapter it was roughly $15"

"When I first opened the box and saw the product, I was disappointed because it was flat, which on the internet, it looked like it had dimension; however, when I lifted it off of the styrofoam and saw that it had pegs to keep it away from the wall, I was more optimistic.  Once I hung it on the wall (which was very easy to hang), I was totally thrilled with it.  It is beautiful and definitely looks three dimensional.  It is worth the money I spent on it and I highly recommend it as it is a beautiful piece of artwork.Sincerely,Nancy"

"The Chronicles Of Trellah, Is a genuine page turner.  It will keep you guessing til the end.  The adventures of Sophina, a smart witted,seemingly fearless young lady that will stop at nothing to get her brother back.  The many characters in this book keep Sophina on her toes at all times, sometimes getting her into trouble.If you are a fan of Hunger Games or Harry Potter, give Chronicles of Trellah a go...I truly recommend it for kids and adults alike.  My daughter has read it twice and loved it.Can't wait to see what other adventures lie ahead for Sophina."
"Too religious and out of touch with reality.Sold as a thriller but really the auther is fixated on his personal and biased religios convictions."
"These bars arrived quicker than anticipated but for my preference, were not very tasty. I kept in mind the nutritional value of the bar as well as the high protein content and low carb for certain activities that I wanted to use them for. Mostly I used them for recovery. The flavor was not coconut but just a bland tasting chewy substance.  They weren't untolerable but I just had to tell myself they were beneficial and will definitely order Quest again, just a different flavor!"
"I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to increase their protein intake for fitness activites pre and post workout for their efficient fast absorption. Using this product guarantees you are absorbing all the nutrients and building components that protein should provide but does not in food form.  Excellent results and you feel differently after using for a couple of days. Very good investment!"

"We have always been Sony buyers, but this Visio is the best electronic purchase we have ever made.  It is everything Visio says it is and more. You can't really appreciate the awsome picture until you see it. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product at a very competative price and your superb delivery service.  Can't wait to buy one for our bedroom.  Would highly recommend this Visio M-Series to all TV watchers."

"Purchased this unit for the dry winter months, The first thing I noticed was that the &amp;#34;medicine tray&amp;#34; is just a molded in cup to the top screen of the unit, very disappointing to see sunbeam would actually market this. This unit has no way of controlling humidity levels, it will run constantly under two selections &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; until it runs out of water... The fact that this unit boils water to raise humidity levels make it very inefficient, I found it much more practical to boil water on the stove to humidify my small one bedroom apartment.After about 5 hours of running, I found that this unit only raised the humidity of a small room by 10%, (tested using a mechanical hydrometer)This unit would be good for a small bedroom that is has few or small windows, and very low air flow."
"The product was pretty.  The fabric was very nice and looked great.  Ther control was cheeply done.  simple on/off button (which was fine), however doesnt work very well.  At times, would have to turn on/off numerous times before would start working.  Have had it since Oct 24, it still works, and we still use it.  Control just aggrivating at times."
"I have read a number of complaints about the packaging flaws on this item, yet I was naive enough to believe the issue was likely to be fixed by now. Buyer beware...that was not the case. Not only was the packaging glue stuck all over a number of disks, most of the disks looked like they had been used as toddler toys. Bran new disks should not look like they have been slid across pavement. Some even have chips in the edges! I didn't have much trouble getting the disks to play at first, but at about season 5 I started having all kinds of trouble. I have had to skip about 10 episodes because they simply will not work in any player of any kind. Of course, by the time I got to that point, it was too late for me to contact a seller with a complaint or do anything about it. I have a hard time believing these disks were bran new when the series was recorded on them. I would have to be a fool to think otherwise."
"This was recommended by an engineer at a local TV station and he was right.  This works great, I am able to pick up many more stations than before.  In fact I bought another one for my mum."

"I couldn't be any more happier with this purchase I've had it for a few weeks now &amp; only put it on my phone for when I go somewhere fancy to preserve the detail of it. Whoever came up with the idea to make such a damn cute case THANK YOU"

"I purchased these lanyards as gifts for my grandson and his friends.  They loved them and liked to wear them with theirpocket knives on them when we went out in the woods hunting and exploring.  The very first day, the hook on two of thelanyards came apart.  The seller sent us replacement ones and I hope that they last.  The lanyards are great but the hookhardware is very cheap and does not last.  Seller is easy to work with and very helpful."

"This is lovely but we have not been able to use it as a lamp because my husband accidently forgot to check the box and threw away the lighting mechanism- OOPS! It is still lovely and we keep it out on the table to look it. If you gets yours and it appears to be wet- don't fret, I talked to the importer and this happens. It is just some of the stain that they use for the base. Simply wipe off the excess and you are good to go.P.S. This guys customer service was AWESOME!!! He is VERY helpful, courtious and replies VERY quickly. Thank you sir!!!"
"LOVE IT! Thought it didn't work because it took about 15 pumps before it started working, but works like a pro! Thank you!"
"This shirt was SO funny I just had to get it for my husband. He prefers LTs, as he is a tall dude (6'6&amp;#34;) but this works well for him and he says it is very comfortable! He has also washed it several times and it looks as good as new still. Thank you!"
"I have had my decal on my iPad for over a year and I have not had any issue with it AT ALL! Granted I had a clear case over it most of the time but even without it on, I never had any issues. High quality decal here folks!!! AND it is from one of my favorite childhood books- WIN-WIN!!!!! Thank you!"
"I haven't used these little beauties YET but they are lovely and look like pearls! I am planning on using them for makeup looks, art projects and nails! Excited to get playing around!"

"Excellent value for a watch that has a compass, thermometer, stopwatch, world time, alarms, etc, and waterproof to 200m. Great low budget adventure watch."
"I love the jacket. it's for my son to wear daily and the quality will probably hold up for years to come."
"My husband loves the large capacity and easy-open wide top.  No worries about a zipper tearing. The leather is luscious."
"Upgraded my older 8 inch Polk sub that recently died.  Easy to set up.  Bought an insignia sub for my Ilive speaker bar and for around the same price the Polk psw10 blows it away.  Only bought the insignia brand as it was an open box item for $35 and it originally goes for $89"
"I just bought the new HDX kindle and I love it...I like the screen. And it's easy to.read.I.would recommend it to anyone that is a beginner as I am..the price was good...my husband also.likes it..so we may be buying another one.down.the road.only the bigger size."
"Works well. Very durable. Plastic doesn't cover the screen, but it comes with a plastic cover that goes directly on the screen"
"We ordered this and got it really fast, but it was in pieces when it arrived.  Probably got damaged during shipping.  We contacted the seller, who was really great.  They immediately shipped a new one.  New one arrived really fast and not damaged.  A few days after we got it, it was broken.  It seems like a cheap product that isn't very durable."
"A wonderful book with so many stories teaching God's love. It holds your interest and leaves much to think about."
"17 lbs gone &amp; counting.  Not a problem to stay on with great results. This product is satisfying and practical, I'm never hungry."
"These experiences could happen to anyone.  I found myself laughing out loud so many times although the experiences were dreadful."
"Love my decal!Easy to apply&amp; really beautiful!  I've had it about a month and it's very durable. Looking to buy one for my cell phone as well."
"Everything that I have purchased from Amazon is wonderful  You have saved us a good deal of money and we are on fixed income so it helps.  Senior citizens should turn to you FIRST....Your service is EXCELLENT...and quick delivery is always appreciated.  Thanks to all of you who make this organization run so well."
"Great quality charm. Heavyish which is good because it doesn't seem breakable. I thought this would come with two charms and not just one for 4 bucks but I guess thats my bad. No problems with shipping."
"yeah that's my personal review some stuff  are good sign stuff  are bad you see there radii gave  that's it I don't know what to tell you more"
"This book was a wonderful joy to read. It has sad parts outweigh with overwhelming happy parts.  It was delightful..."
"It was not as depicted in picture. Picture showed an aluminum or similar type finish.  Came in 100t% plastic. My husband put it on anyway and it looks fine. Time will Tell. I would not have purchased if I had known it was plastic. I guess that's what marketing does, show you a superior product and sell you an inferior product in the hopes you wont send it back?"
"This book got me hooked from day one! I was very happy with everything. :) Sometimes it was a little confusing at times and I had to re-read some parts, but overall it had a great story line."
"I listed that I have a 5c and it did not fit my phone, only fits 5. Had to return cover for refund"
"Headphones are transparent and the cables are longer. The back up ear buds set is very useful. The wire is flexible and sporty"
"These headphones are working fine with me however they are a bit expensive. Many times the bluetooth disconnects and it's annoying."
"The ear on the donkey was broken.  we returned the animals and wanted them to be replaced, instead of credit to the account."
"Although it is advertised with Raffle Tickets, this is meant more for folded 1/2 pieces of paper. As soon as you turn the thing, tickets fall out of the entry slot. :( Hope you weren't hoping to win... your ticket fell out a while ago!"
"Book arrived exactly as described. Good quality, and it even has the dust jacket (most that I have received don't come with those)."
"This deck is amazing. I love using it, but it has a weakness to those decks that involve revoking ability to special summon. Just add two extra blue eyes and this deck is set."
"Very well written historical novel about the life and times of a woman who truly ""Walked the Walk"" and ""Talked the Talk"" for Peace...Highly insightful and thought provoking!  Kudos to Merry Brennan for an excellent read!!"
"Throw away your old cheese cutters. So sharp and glides easily through any cheese density. Again, watch your fingers!Love this knife."
"Excellent range. Clear sound. Works with triple a batteries. light weight but durable.i am very happy with the entire system"
"Very reasonably priced for the product. Very pleased with the screen. Lightweight and moves easily as well as stores easily."
"I would really give this 4 1/2 stars. They were shipped fast and a lot cheaper than others I saw online. The only negative thing I could say is that they were just a little thinner than I had hoped. I have mailed several things so far, and have had no problems, but I worry about something poking and ripping them open. I may just be out of line for worrying about that, because I have really had no problems."
"Love this scale. The only problem I have is I wish the top were just a little larger. When you weigh a large item, it's hard to see the weight and hard to find the button to hold the weight while you take the package off. But if it was bigger, it wouldn't be so portable!! So, it works well and I'm happy. Needs 4 1/2 stars"
"I give it 5 stars it's a great book!!!! I loved one romantic and adventure.I'd recommend it for people who like romance and adventure."
"covers everything. good book to have if you own a neon. i have done a full tune up and other minor fixes according to this and everything is great."

"I was excited about the little pearl, too bad it fell out before I even put the ring in my nose..."
"I was sketchy at first about these but once you wear them for a couple hours they break in they fit good on my board an have little wear from skating in them. They are a little heavy but won't get eaten up as bad by your grip tape like poser dc shoes."
"Solid, stable mount. Holds iPhone with phone protector well. I have not however used the dash mount part of this product (only windshield)."
"Keeps my phone safe and sound when I drop it! I'm a clumsy person when it comes to phones! Hehe"
"I was already of this author's opinion, and everything he said just cemented my position. He presents his history, how he came to be in the position he's in, how his life experiences (especially outside of America) have molded his expectations and understanding of value and wealth, and he makes a great case with real examples of how simplification is the best way. You'll be changed permanently by how many of your problems are &amp;#34;first-world&amp;#34; type, nothing more. Well worth the read--our culture could benefit greatly by more exposure to, and influence by, this book."
"action packed, with memorable characters and lighter moments. my 8-year-old loves it, and I can watch it too. the racing is exciting and I personally find Anakin slightly less annoying when he's a small child. so, this is my fave."
"Good material:"
"Shadows was an amazing book that caught my imagination instantly! It had love, brutality, adventure, and suspense that captivates your mind throughout the whole book."
"I buy these for my om every year at Christmas and she loves them.  She wouldn't own any other brand.  I was skeptical when she first asked for them but they are high quality and durable.  She wears them every day.  Also, Amazon prices are better than anywhere on the web - haven't found them cheaper."
"Thought some of my discs were lost forever due to skipping and freezing but after using this they are watchable again.  Thanks skip dr!!"
"I wish she would write 50 more books I love love these books I was so sad when I got to the last page"
"This book wasn't as good as 50 Shades oh Grey but it was a very good book I would tell someone to get this book"
"This book is for girls that love girly books and you will absolutely fall in love when you read with this book"
"The reason I gave this book a 5/5 is because I thought this book was just like the movie: The Ten Commandments. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read and get a better understanding about Moses' life."
"I liked mine so much, I ordered one for a friend and he likes it too, now I am thinking about ordering another for my sister."
"My son loves these gloves! They're the only ones he hasn't lost this winter! Will be ordering them again next winter."
"Es un libro maravilloso con ilustraciones increibles y una muy buena calidad de papel. Super&amp;oacute; mis expectativas!! Lleg&amp;oacute; a mi domicilio en perfectas condiciones."
"Needed this for a 2001 Mercury Sable. I called the dealership and they said one remote was $60. I bought two for $22.97. Both arrived on time and feel very sturdy so far, but it is only the first day. The instructions were the same as what was listed in my owners manual and both remotes programmed easily. I hope they work for awhile. Overall great purchase, especially for the money."
"This book was so much fun to read. I really had to read it all at once. If it was in French I would buy a copy to all my family members.I look forward to seeing the results of the money speng and money earned report. I'm so excited and full of hope."
"Not wanting to run wires out to the patio I thought I would give these a try.  After getting them delivered and seeing how small and lightweight they are, I was skeptical.  After hooking them up, I was surprised by how good the sound quality was.  They are very easy to install.  I used a 3.5mm Stereo Female to RCA Male Y-Cable to attach the transmitter to an audio out plug on my AV Reciever.  This way I can play CDs or listen to the music channels from Cable TV.  I have them plugged into wall sockets, instead of using batteries, since other reviews said the sound quality isn't as good with the batteries (although I never did try batteries).  I bought a second pair of speakers (comes with a free transmitter) to use on another section of the patio, still using just the one transmitter.  Very easy to set up."
"I am a newbie at buying\using usb sticks. I found out I could store full length movies on them &amp; play them back on my tv with a fairly low cost media player. I think it's pretty neat to be able to store 5 or 6 movies on a 16 gig little stick &amp; watch them on tv without messing with storing DVD's. I don't know much about these sticks or how long they should last etc., but hey, no moving parts! I bought this item at a very reasonable price &amp; shipping was pretty good. Would buy again. Probably soon."
"I'm a newbie with USB sticks. Got to thinking it would be neat if I could convert an entire DVD movie to a SINGLE Mpeg file. Found a program that does that. Ok, NOW I have an entire movie on a little stick and in the process all the dvd files were compressed a lot with no noticable loss in video or audio quality! Trouble was NOW I'd like to view this on my tv. Did some looking and found this thing.My only complaints are that the usb and flash card ports are upside down and it should have come with an HDMI cord. But luckily I had one on hand so all went easy and fast. So far I have two movies on one 16 gig stick with room for 4 to 6 more (depending on movie length). So far, quite happy."
"I dont know if there was a problem with the download or what the deal is, but it just isn't a full game. Every hunting unlimited i've had was a full map, run or drive around, and hunt everything. This game seems very limited, with several glitches... i hate to say it, but i'm really not impressed with it..."
"Some scratches on the screen and quality isn't as great as the original but for half the price HP was going to charge, I'm satisfied."
"Arrived when promised and as described.  Easily installed and worked perfectly.  Excellent transaction."
"Answering Atheism is extremely comprehensible and Trent's explanations are perfectly in line with the Truth and with most needed love."
"I was surprised when I received this pipe in the mail because it far exceeded its images and description!  The pipe smokes great and has an appreciable feel while holding it.  All around good pipe, no complaints!"
"This cross stitch pattern came several days early and I sat very happy with it and almost have it finished"
"You sent the wrong size!  I have a Samsung Galaxy S 111 mini!  Do you have it that size?  It is so pretty, but it doesn't fit my phone, ITS TOO BIG!!  Can you send me another, and I'll send this back to you..."
"i like westwood design. Good the color and style. The services was excellet. Arrive ontime. The baby will enjoy when she is born."
"This Cd has ministered me through the years and when I played it...it just takes me back to the days I live with the Lord and blessings. Highly recommend."
"I bought this to carry my cakes and it is very practical it works. Walmart has it as well for about the same price I later found out. It does its duty however I think it should be a little more secure for the little minicakes. If you don't hold it upright they all turn over."
"Not happy... very sloppy made others were better. I have received better made fans for less. They made these very sloppy some were broken or stuck with glue."
"This item is handy. it works I recommend if doing mini cupcakes is your thing this helps a lot to avoid messes."
"This is such a good cd as well. I love Ingrid's soulful voice, she very anointed and it transmits through her songs. Highly recommend."
"ahhh I can't wait to get this one...it should be on its way. Me without you!!! Love this song. Cant wait to jam with it in the car!!!"
"What a delightful read! Carol has hit the nail with the hammer, dead bang on! I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful book, well written and very insightful, not to mention the wit and humor that accompany the sound advice. There is much to be said for many of the suggestions that she has offered, and I truly believe both men and women should take the time to read this book for sure. Very helpful and informative when it comes to understanding the opposite sex."
"I was searching through Amazon looking for a new case because I was tired of my old Otterbox that was getting washed up. I stumbled upon this one and thought it would be a great fit. It came in the mail in about 5 days and I was excited to start using it.At first I was very pleased with the case. It looked sleek and it was protective. I got the navy blue matte finish one for the iPhone 4. The adapter hole to charge the phone was a little to small. The adapter would fit but it would fall out if you were using the phone which became frustrating really fast. But the major problem was that the corners of the matte finish on the back of the case started to peel off. This started about two weeks after I started to use it."
"She is one of my best friends she is smart beautiful and very kind I love her style and has a good vocabulary she can also call text and call people for you"
"i bought this product and it didnt work for me, it tastes really nasty and i felt no different after taking it. this stuff doesnt work&gt;"

"this game is the best game I ever had.I would give his game to ever one. And I thing you will love it to.  If you like this game tell me or share your opinion."

"Thanks Gary and Drenda, all the way from New Zealand, your book has great spiritual and practical advice to help me fix the money thing!"
"I purchased the Bushnell GPS so we could find our way back to our starting point when we were walking while on vacation. It worked when I tested it in our home town, but was not able to find the satellite when I really needed it when we were vacationing in Aruba and later in St Petersburg Fl.Since it won't work in the situations where I need it the most, it is totally worthless to me. I am extremely disappointed and would strongly recommend against buying this product.Clifford JoensTryon, NC"
"The book wasn't what I was expecting. I was hoping to have some recipes I haven't heard of or tried. Most of the recipes were either something I seen before or things my picky eater wouldn't eat."
"Wonderful little case. Fit perfect on my phone. Just stretched the case a little bit and it fits snug onto my phone.  I love the neon green color. thanks so much!"
"Just what my daughter needed to use for her iPod"

"Love the color day or nite looks nice I have gotten lots of complements and the price is perfect will continue to order"
"Pretty neat. Guess for the price it does a decent job. The main drawback is the volume of un-popped kernels."
"Good readind for a Wiccan, lots of information. My moneys worth. A must have for the Wiccan practicioner to improve their spell and knowledge!"
"The most protection for my IPhone 5 .I can drop it ,kick it and forget it and it bounces back."

"i love this! i have two big dogs and this works wonderfully to walk them both without them getting tangled or pulling me."
"this bag is awesome. has so much room for all of my stuff! and its also super cute so i like that too. i like that it has a clip and velcro pluss a zipper for extra protection and safety of my camera and lenses."
"I am pleased that my case arrived fairly quick, but not too pleased with the look of it.The product preview depicts a more realistic looking stitch, with a dark aqua blue belly and eyes, maroon colored nose and feet, and eyes going into the edges of the case.Here's a picture of how mine looked.[IMG][...]As you can see, my colors are way off, and it looks more cartoon-y.Still pleased, but disappointed at the same time."
"My glue was dry. My acrylic doesn't dry right, it's all gelly like it's old or something. I'm very upset, I was really excited for this. Welp, at least the gems and the oil are nice. -___- I'm mad I spent 16 dollars on this."

After a while the battery started to last longer than the first days. It works great and I have had no problems with it. I would recommend anyone to purchase this battery, it works great and the price is worth it!!!"

"I got this tent for my birthday and first set it up in the backyard one rainy spring weekend to test its water resistance.  It was a little damp and the wind collapsed it, but my yard is wide open and full of sand/gravel on that side.  I bought some more yellow stakes and we didn't blow away at all this weekend.  The tent also stayed dry under the cover of the trees which was great.  We love that we can fit our queen-size air mattress and 2 sleeping bags for the kids in the back room with plenty of room for storage and moving about.  The &amp;#34;windows&amp;#34; in the front screen room close up to keep the elements out which came in handy during the rain - especially with two young kids and a dog.  I put it together myself in less than twenty minutes and I'm only 5' 4&amp;#34; tall.  I would definitely recommend it for families and people that camp for long amounts of time.  Our next camping trip will be for 7+ days and we can't wait."
"I ordered this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift last year and he absolutely loves it.  All of his friends are impressed by it and it's sturdy enough that our two year old daughter doesn't knock it over.  I would definitely recommend this product for gamers."
"I would highly recommend this book, especially to any who knows what it is like to pick cotton, or knows someone who has picked cotton. As a boy,  my father picked cotton and I could see him being as curious and mischievous as Luke.  My father also taught me to love Cardinal baseball, and of course Mr. Musical. The references to both were nostalgic and really took me back to childhood days."
"The replacement lamp was just what I needed.  I was not sure what the problem was to begin with, but when I called different businesses to find out if they carried this lamp, one individual suggested I go to Amazon to order the lamp.  Amazon had the best price and the lamp was so easy to install.  My 10 year old grandson helped me with it."
"The best factory painting of my predators collection. And comes with 2 accesories. Absolutely perfect for a beginner collector and fans..."
"I sent this e-card for my brother on Christmas and I was incredibly disappointed to find out that it didn't arrive on time and I had to re-send it. It went through right away when I had it re-sent, but there is really no excuse for an e-card to not arrive on time."

"Have had the case for about a month now and it still works great. The fit is perfect. The slimness of the case is great, and the feel of it is very nice. I like it alot. My clips seem to be working great and hanging in there. So far no complaints or problems."
"for cheaper item this was worth the price. it fits anywhere on harness or pack and i tried the stick but you have to scrape off the paint first for the first time."
"Alton Gansky's story of a grounded astronaut who gets a second chance to go into space has everything --- absorbing plot, intense suspense, strong but vulnerable characters, and engaging detail. His ability to add enough technical information to make you feel like you are there, as well as his deep insight into human nature, combine to add a realism to the novel that tingles your spine. I could swear that Gansky had been an astronaut, and after reading Zero-G, I feel like I've been one, too.The complexity of the plot make it hard to categorize --- is it sci-fi, action/suspense, murder mystery? In some strange way, it is all three, and Gansky manages to weave it all together like a master storyteller. This is one novel that could easily be made into a movie."
"I haven't, of course, read the whole book -- I mean, after all, it is a devotional with 52 entries, so I assume the author expects you to read one a week for a year. But I have read several, all in one sitting -- I couldn't stop myself -- and I intend to dip back into this regularly (maybe weekly, maybe more often). It's a very accessible devotional, and not something you have to work at to read.That doesn't mean I consider it fluffy or frothy -- far from it. Rose Chandler Johnson covers a wide range of topics and bases each devotional entry on a Scripture passage. The passages she chooses are from all over the Old and New Testaments; they are mostly well-known verses, but she manages to bring a fresh perspective to them. She is able to be profound without becoming pedantic or obtuse -- and that is a hard balance to maintain.This would be a great devotional for a new Christian, but even the more seasoned believer will get a lot out of it, despite the fact that it is intentionally light reading. Have you ever read a devotional early in the morning, and just couldn't follow it because the text was too plodding? You won't have that problem with this devotional, but you will still be challenged by it."
"Eddie Jones begins his book with a disclaimer that it is a collection of supporting material from the classes he teaches, and is not a ""full-blown writing book."" Be that as it may, this short read contains more direct practical advice than many of the ""full-blown"" books I've read on fiction writing. focusing on four prevailing elements of good fiction --- plot, dialogue, characters and scenes --- Jones covers the essence of these, identifying where an author can go wrong and providing good examples of the right way to do it. Do I wish at times that he had gone into a point more fully? Of course, but then I would have had to invest far more time in reading the book. I like how pithy and succinct this book is --- similar to some of the advice he gave me when I wrote (and revised) my first novelThe Case of the Exploding Speakeasy. I'm sure I'll be referring to A Novel Idea again and again as I write my next novel."
"Those boots look good, but when we have a lot of snow they  always get wet inside and it's just snow,  not  water or something, therefore I don't know why they called waterproof! I'm really frustrated"
"I liked this book a lot because it was very exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat just having to know what was going to happen next. Also, it was nice to finally find out why the ""crazy vampire"" was after Kismet. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that Devereux was not in this book as much as he was the others, but it was still great even so! I absolutely can't wait for the next on to come out!!"
"I really liked this book! It wasn't quite as exciting as the ""Vampire Shrienk"" series, but still a fun book none the less. I really liked the female character, she seemed very strong and independent. The sex scenes in this book were really ""hot"" as well."
"So theres already 12,009 reviews here! Everything i could say has been said - the books awsome! All these one star reviews - WHAT? I loved it, the whole series, beginning to end! It wasnt mind numbing to read, theres plenty to keep you entertained cover to cover. I couldnt put it down. The hunger games trilogy opened up a can of worms for me in this particular genre, lots of delightful worms!"
"Absolutely loved this book..... I don't think Karina Halle could write a bad book.An emotional journey of love, passion, tattooed girls and hot spaniards."

"Its been running great for about a month now. I haven't noticed any noise issues at all. Good water movement for a small tank."
"Defiantly MUST buy! The quality of the spiralizer is top, the knives are sharp and I don&amp;#8217;t have any problem with falling vegetables. The plastic is firm, in order to break it you will have to try hard. I am 100% satisfied. The delivery was on time also. That is an amazing product for vegan pasta lovers."
"My husband got my wedding ring and I guess he forgot to ask me my ring size and bought it without knowing and its platinum and diamond so I dont want to just give it to some one to size so I ordered the sizing ring gard and couldn't believe how easy it was to put on so now I can were my ring with out worrying about loosening it thank ya so much!  Vera"
"My husband is a good ol country boy and is not big on fancy things so he lost his wedding ring from when we got married and told him to pick  that he likes on Amazon and liked this one because it has wood on it so I ordered it and he loves it and it is just perfect for him so now hopefully he wont loose it! Vera"

"You will definitely see life through different eyes after reading this book! Brene Brown is brilliant and brings so much to life that we take advantage of. This is not a fad or the next best thing, this is reality, a way of life. You will feel empowered and transformed, you will appreciate and recognize your own vulnerability and courageous acts of others. I truly brings you back down to a good, comfortable place where you can enjoy yourself and others without be critical and embrace life as it is.Great for anybody! Highly recommended! Love her style and how she gets her message out!"

"This component controlled the fan motor in my mother in-laws Camry.  It had two screws holding it in under the dash and worked great."
"I just needed one part that clamps on my uniform for work.  All other parts haven't been used yet.  I will probably use the dash mount eventually."
"As advertised.  I can walk around my living room and kitchen hands free while on the line with somone.Mmy cell phone is charging on a end table and 20 feet away."
"Bought it for my wife and she uses it in her car.  She can even get out of her car and walk around it while carrying on a conversation."
"takes great pics and came quick. Good color and black and white pics.  took great pics of my kids. I'm happy with product."
"This is the only paddle holster that I have found that fits my Taurus PT1911AR.  The Taurus has a larger accessory rail than most other 1911s.  This holster works great."
"These Anne Klein women's socks are pretty colors, made with good quality and are very soft.  I recommend them highly"
"Damn good choice I made , well done  product, protect every aspect of the phone know, I'm looking to order one for my iPad."
"Could not put it down. Easy read. Past around to other family members and they loved it too. Hooray for those who rescue dogs."
"Lindsey Stirling's album is a unique blend of modern techno music and classic violin. It may seem difficult to create multiple pieces using only one instrument and minimal vocals, she has created a creative palette of color and originality."
"This wallet iPhone case fits everything you need to carry when running to the store or out sightseeing, actually pretty much anywhere that you need to go. Great in places where your everyday pocketbook would be too much, like at a football game or to the movies, etc.  The color on this page makes it look like a dark purple.  When you receive yours it is more like lavender.  A coworker ordered the darker red one and it was more muted than the picture shows.  The only thing I have found that I am not completely pleased with is once you put all of your items and phone in it and place it in your pocket (if you don't want to use the wrist strap that is attached) it is a little bulky in you pocket.  Other than that, it is very convenient and come in many colors and is less expensive on Amazon than the ones I have seen around town."
"Case it so cute &amp; fits my phone perfectly. Ive gotten a lot of compliments. Shipping ny awesome as well. I didnt expect to get it back so quickly."
"Loved this one,toss up between this one,The Wolf and The Dark Knight ,Im glad it was a long book didnt want it to end and love her writing."
"It is even prettier than the picture on the website. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you so much!"
"I am starting to love Mr. Pettigrew and Mr.Martin.  I really loved all the descriptive phrases and the way Mr. Martin moves Mr. Pettigrew through his very colorful life.  No matter what happens to him, Mr. Pettigrew will find a way to stand tall, a man on conviction.  I love never knowing where Mr. Martin will take us. There is just something about a man who will always do what is right even if it is not in his favor to do so.  This book is very entertaining and has a flavor of how the west really was.  I had a margarita and curled up and went to bed with Mr. Pettigrew. A great Friday night read."
"We have one for both myself and husband; we love them. Super easy to put on and clean. I do not reccomend front facing carry per doc reccomendations, its bad for babies hips and backs."
"Especially now that he is teething he loves them even more. I bought 5 because we use them so often."
"I have had this product for about a month now, and they have never once lifted off of the keys or caused any issues with having to reapply them. They are simply 3M stickers that sit right on top of your keys and they look and feel great! They were much easier to apply than I would have ever thought! When I am ready for a different design, I will DEFINITELY buy from this company again!"
"I enjoy the song, the meaning of the song, up lifting to listen to it!  Going to buy the CD!"
"build quality is great. used it for diving and will use it again. the silicon is soft and wont hurt your face. keep in mind it doesnt give you the view of side."
"For some reason this product doesnt work that well with apple tv. I wanted a low profile cable to save space and purchased this one so i can stop using my present cable that is very thick. At times this cable delivers signals and at times it doesnt. At first it seemed like a loose connection issue but it isnt. The cable is secure in the Apple TV and the TV and yet it sporadically looses connection. May be its a bad cable or may be its not compatible with apple tv (dont know how its possible)"
"so i thought i would buy this because its digital and will give much more approximate weight. one would conclude as they see digital scales at grocery stores when they buy produce or meat. Buy something else. i weight different each time in a span of 5 minutes. Sounds hilarious but its a waste of my money. tried various surfaces, wood, tile, carpet. None helped. you need a calculator to measure your weight. You need to measure atleast 5 times and then take an average. you will really get it right."
"Writer knows how to throw you off track to the real villain and keeps you guessing. Great sibling story along with local law enforcement corruption and a little bit of romance. Good mixture and diversity."
"This book is very graphic. It took me by surprise and I could not put it down because I had to see where it was going. Not my usual type of read but was enjoyable."
"Arrived on time, worked instantly - a very good deal for the price.  There are a few slightly cheaper plastic offerings however the overall best value is this unit"
"It meets all expectations towards browsing, calling,  texting, pictures,  camera.It meets all expectations towards browsing, calling,  texting, pictures,  camera effective product"
"its an ok set the only thing the knives are reall dull but all the other stuff was good dishwasher safe and better than going to walmart and spending 2$ an item n the cutting board tiny its more like a cocktail cutting board n the can open broke on the first use"
"Great headphones, I've had many pairs, all in ear, including Shure se210, Brainwav M3's, Razer Moray+ and Klipsch S4's. These easily have the best and sharpest bass even when used with an amplifier. Hip hop and rap music is my main preference so these did a great job at delivering the abundant bass.Highs and lows are nice so good sound overall. I would recommend these to anyone looking for high bass and a good mid range price. Headphones themselves were a sturdy build and an interesting fit with one part of fitting in the cup of your ear while the other goes into the canal. Also came with a small origami crane and a letter from the sender. The Japanese make quality audio wear, which is what led  me to buy these in the first place. Very satisfied, 5/5."
"Years ago, I found this beauty. The independent ratings spoke volumes, and not one was even remotely negative. I purchased one, absolutely love it - it is spectacular in person and the mother of pearl dial is exquisite!!  Now that I was able to get it at a slightly discounted rate, I purchased two more - one that I already gave as a gift to someone who lamented that she had the very same one and lost it - and was mourning it ever since. Well, now she has it back again, and she actually started to cry after she opened the box and saw what was inside. It was definitely my best gift-giving yet!!If you are lucky enough to still be able to purchase this gem, don't let it go. You will NOT be disappointed. The photo does not show it justice."
"It is classic in an understated way. The leather is nice and although it can be a bit challenging to get on the food (wear think socks), the shoe is incredibly comfortable. I do not feel like I am wearing a high heel, and this shoe quickly became one of my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; accessories."
"I have charged it several times, and then attempted to charge my iPhone with it. I can't tell when it's working, and so far it has done nothing even though it was fully charged. It did not arrive with adequate instructions, and I would welcome any suggestions on how to use it correctly.  I gave it two stars rather than one because I figured there must be an error on my part and not totally on the part of the device itself.AMENDMENT TO MY REVIEW:  When I pushed down the small button for a quick 1/2 second, it finally registered with my phone and is charging it now. The error was on my part, albeit there are no decent instructions that come with it.  I am hoping for a quick charge."
"I hesitated before purchasing it as I thought it was a bit pricey-especially because I have other low black boots, but the style is very classic and you can't go wrong with it. You do have to be careful when wearing these, because the leather is nice but somewhat delicate. I scuffed the pointed toes the first time wearing them - was very upset, but was able to work on the pulled leather and make it look a little less noticeable.  It is a comfortable boot, and hard to find. But if you treat it with care, you will get a lot of enjoyment from it."
"This is the only food my rabbit will eat most of. And when I say most of I mean every once in a while he will stop eating the green pieces....and then switch to not eating the brown pieces...and then sometimes the red pieces."
"Good price. Works fine. Shipped well. Etc etc Would buy again. Needed a new adapter for my computer and this one works fine."
"HILARIOUS satire movie. So good. There's not a better thing to spoof than the fashion industry, and this movie does it perfectly."
"Awesome!!! The best album of them all by static x! Loved this album cents the day it came out back in the day!"
"Had some nice cool stuff u can do in the game like never b 4 but the game itself is junk!!!! So very disappointed with this game... I play my black ops 2 more than this game still! They could have done a way way better job on this game.. Black ops 2 is way way better than ghost!"
"I was sent the wrong one.!!!I now have a screen protector that has a big square hole on the bottom...."
"I really enjoyed this book! The first one was good and thus one even more. I can't wait to read the next one!"
"I can't keep away from these books! They are great and I'm thrilled and ready to read the next book to get the next piece of the puzzle!"
"I have sympathy for all of the people you have given your misleading, and deceiving information to. You are a false prophet... You turn a truthful fact, that has been sacred and ancient and an influence to the holy bible, and you turn it in to a deceiving ego based oppinion to fit your own beliefs. Leave it to the church to twist and mold sacred truth and turn it in to something evil and wrong. My heart go's out to people that are blinded, and might not ever become awakened because of deceiving belief systems and false prophets..."
"It was good but when she goes into that time warp she stays. Which i was bored fromBut i t was good overall"
"I absolutely love this game. My only problem is getting stuck on a level. I am currently stuck in level 197 and have been since December 2013. That is a bit frustrating. But over all I really love it!!"
"I loved the way the jeans felt on but I expected if I ordered my size they would be to small. Turns out they would of fit me perfectly."
"I had pretty worn out tires before I had purchased this tire, I also bought the rear tire. These tires are definitely amazing! It makes riding soo much more enjoyable! Grips very well going around corners at 55 mph. Love them!"
"I bought this as a present for my Mother who loves to go on walks, she is very pleased with the headphones. They keep in the ear perfectly even when jogging. They are very comfortable and sound great. Couldn't ask for more with the price!"
"The rumble that it gives is a nice comfortable rumble and the volume does not need to be very loud. The sound quality is very impressive, not Bose quality, but better than I expected. The only thing that is bad about it is that the arm rests aren't very sturdy, as they keep coming loose every once and a while. But If you do as the warning stickers say and don't move the chair with the arm rests or get out of the chair using them, they will be in good hands."
"LOVE IT!It is the most I have ever spent on a watch, but it was so worth every penny.The Analog syncs with the digital time that you set.Has glow in the dark analog, which i'm pretty sure it doesn't saw that in the review.Digital very easy to read, also easy to set and understand the watch programming.The only thing not good is the light. Can't read the digital with it, and doesn't light up evenly."

"If you like quality do not  spend the cash. I have 5 Birkin inspired bags, Which I bought from a number of suppliers. This one is definitely not BIG, like it says in the picture. The seams appear very poorly made for the price.I compared the inside, outside, size. strength, &amp; quality. And I find it to be the same exact bag i bought on Ebay for $29.00, both bags looks just like leather. The Ebay bag has side rounded double bound seams on the outside. Otherwise, both bags were exactly the same. Only difference is one smells like leather and the ebay one has silver hardware and amazon had gold. I will give it 3 stars only because its leather.  I love Amazon and will continue to buy, but this one is not worth it."
"sturdy,excellent quality. Heavy duty and built to last for a long time. Would highly recommend for people who take pride inhaving good tools."
"Very good reading as usual, there is always a twist to her stories. Very interesting stories and I do endeavour to read all her books that are available."
"Excellent.  Could not put it down.  Looking forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy.  This is a book that I was very hesitant to read  but glad I did because it is very good with a story behind it."
"Thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy.  Could not put the book down. There is an interesting story within the book. A must read."
"worked great! Kind of a pain to get apart and clean out though. this one you actually get to hear 'em FRY!"
"This stuff is AMAZING!! it will boost your engine life, fuel mileage, and much more! i use it all the time for rebuilding motors!  will buy this for years to come!!"
"I've never had one like this before, but it works great! super easy to clean and work on. i would recommend this to anyone!"
"was a perfect fit for my phone and worked perfectly the first time! kind of a pain to change out though! Needs to have a magnetic screwdriver!"
"it is not exactly the same as a griffin box like i thought, but close. not as thick, which i like cause i can put it in my pocket much easier,but the rubber is really thin, making for less protection. but has worked good so far!"
"Bought this for the wife, because she couldn't find a women's without pink... she loves it and it keeps her warm on cool mornings in the woods"
"I have found this book extremely interesting from the point of view of total lack of knowledge of what actually went on in Africa at that time and the very difficult conditions encountered by those who chose to venture into such an inhospitable continent. As if the conditions were not enough to contend with there were also the natives with their requirements in order to pass through ""their land"". Sounds a bit like how things are today!!! Having said that I found it written in the very much journalistic form rather than as a novel. I now note this was the purpose of the writing in general.All in all a very good and enlightening read."
"Beauty and beast collide within a female SPARTAN 3. She is not a child's toy.. these are for posing only! Her details are spot on. The molding is clean and her hands are smaller than most other Halo: Reach action figures. Making it easy to fit amything in her hand! Can be customized. Warning: Her hands and feet camn be broken off with slight neglect. Not for children.. the games arent for children and the figures arent for children either! Over all she is a stunning addition to my collection, standing back to back with Kat they complement each others beauty and ferocity alike"
"THE PRODUCT COMES IN A SIZES MERY SMALL, I ASKED SIZE L, IT ARRIVED SIZE &amp;#34;XXL&amp;#34; BUT IT IS VERY SMALL FOT ME, ABOUT THE STYLE THEY ARE VERY PRETTY BUT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SIZE"
"This sucker was hard to put together (I seriously put the crib together much faster). It seems as though the pieces were too tight (I think I still have 2 screws that weren't put in, because there was no possible way to screw it in (in some places). My baby only used it the first 6 weeks (I know it's meant for the first few weeks), but if you're looking into a bassinet (buy one that is a playpen) it would be a smart buy!"
"Great price for this product. I still use the bassinet part for my 6 month old (since it's so spacious); I still have so much use for it. Don't bother buying another bassinet (I wish I had bought this product first), since my baby grew out of the other bassinet at 6 weeks :(. It was simple to assemble. I recommend this product!"
"My baby took to this bottle quick. I had no problems whatsoever. They did last long, I already have my baby on the 9 ounce bottle... I would definitely recommend buying!"
"I'm giving this item 3 stars because I do love this type of organization. Unfortunately, as soon as I got the package delivered I put it to use in my diaper bag, when I pulled them out (still the first day of having it) to show my husband, one of the tabs that hold the hook to the mesh pouch completely tore off &amp;#128544; (so the hook was clipped to the ring without the pouch). I didn't overpack it at all. I didn't want to go through the hassle of taking everything out and returning it, so I'm just thinking of keeping it (I will contact the seller to see if they'll send me one replacement pouch, if possible... If not, then I will return it). I think it's a bit overpriced for something like this to happen."
"Very stylish! You can fit at most 4 cards (tightly) in the case. Doesn't really protect anything when dropped... But it is nice and I would definitely order it again!"
"So far so good, my daughter loves it! It took me over a month to finally choose this convertible carseat. I was torn between this one and chicco. I do travel a lot, so after reading many reviews I really wanted safety as a priority (and Britax was it). It was pretty easy to install, looks and feels comfortable!"
"Good hair band is so nice.Material too softValue too good.very very  I adored ^^I want to buy different color"
"I have long been a Sherlock Holmes enthusiast. While presenting numerous period discrepancies, this book is well worth including in Holmes fan fiction."
"I have no problems with it, it is very good keeps from anybody going in its perfect I would recommend it to anybody"
"Remembering can be a awesome thing especially if you sometimes feel like you cant remember. Its almost new again, if that makes any sense"
"Let's not just create something to sell toys again lets add plot &amp; background. Why not right ? What's the worse that can happen . . . You mean whats the best that can happen. A Huge Fandom That likes the show so much that they create music , art , games , OCs and or episodes. Lauren Faust herself said she thought people were gonna hate it and think it was dumb. She said every week after the next new episode premiered she waited each week for some sort criticism. Waiting for some hate that never came. Lauren Faust took a chance. I think they really did something right. No I KNOW"
"Seen the show heard the music admire the art so why not play the games. I probably shouldn't have because I can't stop playing"
"I got nearly nothing but positive things to say about MLP:FiM. The only down part is when season 3 ended Lauren Said &amp;#34;That's not the direction I would have taken the show&amp;#34;. So That's always made me wonder how she would have done it. And what if (hypothetically speaking) when she left the show, Hasbro said dnt worry you gave us a winner a sure money maker we'll fill your pockets. I can only imagine that to her it wasn't about the money not even close"
"Exactly what I wanted, it got in a few weeks. It's a little bigger than I imagined it, but then again the Galaxy S4 is a big phone. Overall I love it !"
"I fell in love with the color since spring is coming up I needed something to match my outfits:) Great service, I ordered it a few days ago &amp; its already here!  Came in a little package &amp; it was delivered straight to my door. Totally recommend this product! Thank you :)"
"I bought this for my husband on Christmas and h ha played it everyday for a month so it must be pretty great considering he had never even heard of it."
"Backgrounds, shapes, colors, textures, stickers, this game has it all and it's simple enough for my two year old to play on his own. If I could only have one app, it'd be this one!"
"My toddler loves the look of the icon and always wants to play &amp;#34;magic dog&amp;#34;. Once he gets on he gets very frustrated. Nothing is straight forward and he has never been able to play a whole game. I can't even figure how to open some parts."
"Right on time..amazing and cute! Def recommend!! I use them as decor near my kitchen window. I will be buying more at some point :)"
"I love this game I am on level 4 and I just got the game yesterday and I love how you through the balls at the glass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I bought this battery as a back up to have as an extra for my phone. I charged it and keep it handy &amp; ready so all i have to do is switch out the dead one and replace for the fully charged one. Best thing i ever done."
"My daughter is seven.  She is quite big for her age.  She is tall and quite plump in areas.  Furthermore, I bought this in a size large thinking it would be perfect because that's what she's in right now.  Unfortunately, it is a little snug, but she loves the color.  It's not too bad."
"I really love purple so I knew this was for me and the fact that it was only $6 made me even happier.  I dropped my phone once and it had no scratches or damage, except for on the case.  This product is great so far."
"One of the valve leaks air . Wont stop, only when I put the valve cap on. Checked it a week after it still leaje whem I remove cap"
"The case came within a couple of days of ordering it. My son thought the design was cool and it fitted the phone perfectly. But barely 2 months after purchase the design is rubbing off the case. I know it was cheap, but expected it to last a little longer."
"My wife gave me a Kindle Fire for Christmas, and I installed the Facebook app then before reading the reviews.  I encountered the same issue with the news feed as the others.  Disappointed, I uninstalled, and just browsed to Facebook.Tonight, I decided to try it again, and was pleased to see that the bug is fixed, and the app now works properly.  I decided to write this review, so others won't think it is still broken without trying it."
"The many footnotes unveil and explain the Bible so wonderfully that it makes reading it so much more of a real enjoyable experience,"
"I needed another $1 for an add-on-item and these weren't even worth the $2 I spent. They are extremely thin elastic, they do not last at all. I have some Elastics of the same brand I bought at Walmart and these don't even come close to that. I hate them!"
"Just as good as I expected. They were in perfect condition when I got them. And they tasted just heavenly!"
"I recently received this razor for free from Gillette to try and I must say it is amazing. The handle is very durable and solid and it has the perfect shape. It does not constantly fall out of my hand while shaving. It will certainly not break unlike the cheap dollar store razors that I was using. I would recommend you try this great razor."
"I received these razor blades for free via a program run by Gillette. That being said there are the best razors ever. I thought the standard 5 blade cartridge provided me with the best Razor blade shaving experience I have ever tried UNTIL I tried the Power version my opinion these are closest, most comfortable blades available today. These blades are very good and last me 3 weeks with a thick beard. I shave my beard and also my head and my skin is smooth and soft."
"I love this organizer! It is a bit bulky but that doesn't bother me at all. I have mine filled to the max and it is still intact. Like 25oz bottles of shampoo and conditioner, I didn't think it could hold anything that heavy but so far it  is doing just that, there a multiple heavy bottles in this, at least 5. If anything changes I will update my review."
"I got the Haute Metal. It has a nice color and if you practice putting the polish on you can get it almost perfect, not too thick but not too thin. I used a dark red for my base color and it looks awesome. Will defiantly be buying more!"
"I bought this so there would be no more clutter on our fireplace, 8 sets of keys and mail, just gets to be too messy. So I decided to buy this even after reading some of the reviews. There is a small gap, but so far I haven't had anything fall through the gap. We have it hanging right next to the door and it looks great"
"I am looking for something to make a nice, but easy bun. Unfortunately this is not it! I tried to use it am it snapped into pieces before is even got to try it out. I emailed the company about it before I wrote a review, they did say they would send me another one, but they never did. So I'm going to recommend this to NO ONE! Please buy one that actually haas a chance at working, this is just thin cheap plastic. Yes it is cheap enough I didn't ask for a refund, but they shouldn't sell something that doesn't work!"
"The polish is okay but the color is not nice at all. I have a lot of pink and red polishes, but this one just is not very nice at all. It does shatter nicely if you apply just the right amount."
"These are very inexpensive and easy to use. They worked for me. You just have to make sure you only get the tip wet and nothing more or you might not be able to read the results."
"I read some reviews that said it's comparable to the otterbox, and it is absolutely not!  If your talking on the phone for more then a minute the extremely hard plastic part over the camera hurts. Whoever compared it to an otterbox has obviously never owned one, they might be expensive but they are well worth the money. This one I paid under $5 for it and it was not even worth that much."
"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Defiantly a must read. I know I will read it more then once! I would have given 10 stars if I could."
"Best album I have bought in a while! I am definitely glad I made this purchase, you will not regret purchasing this album."
"Phenomenal love story. So real and relatable, not cheesy at all. One of the best young adult novels I have ever read."
"Great read. Not too graphic and the depiction of the land was breathtaking.  Lorna was a sweet heroine. Loved it"
"I love reading about Montana's wild, gorgeous beauty. The Calder saga books will always be my all time favorite read."
"My baby is 11 old months and 3 weeks. He couldn't feet anymore in the last car seat it was very uncomfortable for him that he is a little told guy. The recaro Prosport is very easy to put on the car. My baby looks great with the red color he looks great and he sleeps comfortable. In my car looks amazing is very good quality, safe and easy to buckle."
"Looks really fake I: It's far too shiny, it just didn't match up well. Darker than I thought it would be."
"Hard to put down, Grisham at his best. A story about injustice and those who fight to make it right."
"I really love is launcher wine it really helps save the wear and tear on my shoulders. This launcher works piece and gets some real distance and the ball without too much shoulder activity. The ball fits nice and tight and releases on the snap,"
"This storage box is not big but just perfect for jewelry and such. The box looks very good only desk and does not stand out looking odd like others boxes I have had. The craftsmanship on the box is very good I feel."
"Yes is Charlie's soap is perfect for us since we have well water and is makes a huge difference in the softness, smell and quality of the overall wash. We can see a huge improvement in our clothes now."
"I bought this retail model and after 2 weeks it died on me. I was not happy at all so luckily I could return it. I went and bought the Airfloss Dental Pro Model since it said it was a lot better. Well I am happy to report that the dental pro model is still working fine after 3 months. The battery life on the pro model is better too from what they said. That's being said it worth the extra money."
"I was going to a boating retreat on one of those friggin sailboats so my wife wanted to dress me up like Thirston Howell III! I got these sneakers since they looked like boat shoes and they were very comfortable. Kudos!"
"Revagin face cream did the job in erasing almost all the little lines and wrinkles I had around my eyes and mouth. I did not have deep lines so the improvement was not drastic but enough for me to notice and since these lines bothered me I am so happy."
"I hate some skepticism about this device but read up on it and the science made sense to me. I used this massager daily for a few weeks and started to see some elongation eventually. The rollers were comfortable and it was fun to relax and jelq myself for awhile. I would always wind up finishing myself off at the end nice I was so turned on from milking myself for awhile. I think I gained about half inch so far and will keep going. I made some videos if anyone wants to see :)"
"I am not finished reading it yet and I already know that this book will be one of my refer back to share a chapter with a friend.It is a great faith builder book."
"Asked the boyfriend to order these for me. I've got long skinny arms and they came up to just above the elbow on me. The dragon design looks cool and the material is comfortable so these were a win for me."
"THIS IS SO AWESOME! THE MOST FEARED GOD CARD IS NOW A LEGITIMATE TOURNAMENT PLAYABLE CARD! This is a MUST buy for anybody who is a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh. It came in MINT condition! Nothing better to ask for! :)"
"it was  the best choclate i have had in a long time .i was having my family  bring them over from scotland. will be buying  more  cadbury stuff"
"this game is so much fun. I think that it is the most best game that I have ever played in my entire life."
"iPhone 4 / 4S Anti-Glare, Anti-Scratch, Anti-Fingerprint - Matte... GenericIt's a piece of plastic - what more can I say.  It's a stocking stuffer for my grand-daughter."
"Great book. Veronica Roth is extremely talented and to write this series was an amazing task. It is such a great story with an ending that fit just perfectly."
"This is a Good game but was a little easy for me but was still fun. Nice way to pass the time."
"You paid $10 for a polo?  Guess what you got?  A $10 polo!  Not the best quality, not the worst."
"Excellent quality and your car drives like winning after you put it on. I bought a similar Chicago Bears frame last year. After putting it on my car, it ran well for the first quarter mile but gave out once I hit the fourth quarter mile."
"It's absolutely terrible. It leaves spots on your teeth and it's painful. My teeth hurt for days afterwards. Do not recommend!"
"Works great for our claw foot bathtub. Well constructed and looks really nice too. Glad we bought it and hope to get several years of use"
"The brim was not as firm as I would have liked it to be but really nice hat and comfortable."
"I LOVED FLECHER/BREEZE. IT WAS FUNNY HOW HE WAS TRYING TO FIGHT FOLLOWING IN LOVE AND I LOVED HOW SHE HANDLED HIM.  SHE INITIALLY NOTICE HIS PROBLEM AND NEW HOW TO HELP HIM DEAL WITH IT AND HE NEEDED SOMEONE, BUT WOULD NEVER REALIZED IT UNTIL HE MEET HER."
"I watch the tv show Castle and this book is just like the show. Loved it and will be reading the rest of the series."
"When I click on friends and gifts, the box pops up to enter my character name. Can't get to my friends or collect my gifts. Fix these issues and I would give this game five stars, I do really like the game."

"I ordered this dvd for my car since it had a decent rating.  It doesn't work properly.  First of all it takes a long time to start playing a disc and then it gets stuck for no reason.  I put in new dvds that definitely weren't scratched and still had the same problem of taking a few minutes till it started playing and then it constantly stops in middle.  These problems are from the beginning it never worked properly.  I'm also upset because I spent a lot also to install it into my car.Do not buy this product unless you are looking to through out your money."

"Comfortable and stylish. Good to wear for casual or dressy. Good fit and height. The incline is comfortable and doesn't cause any pain during wear. The height of the heel is about 2 3/4 inches and was perfect for me (5' 4&amp;#34;) so I could pair them with a long maxi dress. I would highly recommend these, especially for those who want more height but are not used to wearing heals."
"I was a little weary that it wouldn't be able to blend ice or would burn out.I've had it for a little over 2 months now and its great, I love that I can just screw on the top and take it to go.Love it!"

"Item needed 4 S hooks and 2 chains to install on my existing stand. Was advertised as having everything needed and it did not. Was easily solved with a trip to Home Depot."

"I ordered this a day after I picked up my macbookpro. I was thinking about buying this in the Apple store for the regular price. I decided to just buy the speck see thru hard cover. I was a little skeptical if it would still fit with the hard cover. IT FIT PERFECTLY! This is a great product for a reduction of the price!"

"I spent my early years (1940's) growing up in Louisiana and saw the division between blacks and whites - separate drinkingfountains - blacks only could sit at the back of the bus (my favorite spot) and thought it strange at the time.  Mr. Mandel'sbook brought it all back to me and I enjoyed his writing very much indeed - honest - truthful and sincere.  Thanks."
"the story line was OK---overall many of the children I work with can relate to this book as they struggles to accept 'no' for an answer- still I would recommend this book."
"This effort put forth by the author clearly involved her soul and I highly recommend this to anyone who feels afraid to follow their heart.  This book is raw and honest to the core.  It leaves no stone unturned in telling one person's journey to the other side of the world with only herself as her guide.  The lessons within can be applied to any journey no matter if its Singapore or to that next job interview down the street.  It teaches courage, self confidence and realization of oneself.  In it is found internal struggles that all humans face when taking any kind of leap to where they want to be.  It tells us how to make something out of nothing.  Not everyone will succeed but we all must try.  In that we will be satisfied."
"I am 12 years old and my friend and team mate has the bat and one day he hit the ball really good and it hit the top of the fence but it was not a homer but it was close and today he did the same type of hit and it bounced of the guys mitt and rolled under the fence and the person who played outfield did not put his hand in the air so he ran all the way in and it was a run.But if you would like to know the details it has grate grip it looks super good it is legal for all tournaments and it is all composite it's one of the best bats I know and a another good bat is the Easton that is black and yellow don't know the name but it's in my wish list if u are interested in it"

"First of all, it is not illegal under BATFE rules to have this conversion as long as this conversion is done by a certified gun smith; the proper tax stamps and paperwork filled out. Just make sure that you also ensure that it isn't against your state law in owning a weapon like this.For you newbies out there, if you want a full auto weapon, the SKS is not the way to go, and you shouldn't be trying something like this anyway. If you screw it up, you will have a runaway (weapon fires on full auto without trigger compressed) this can lead to serious consequences for you or some innocent bystander. If you want full auto weapons, then look into the AK47, Galil, M-4 Carbine or LAR-47, these weapons were designed to operate under these conditions and need no conversions, just a background check and a lot of money.Don't be the retard that gets the pretty silver braclets for going about it the wrong way."
"Received items in perfect condition n was exactly what I ordered unfortunately I ordered the wrong size n had to send it back. Very pleased!"
"The cover is really cute. Although, I thought the entire case was has, but found the front had to be stuck on. I still like it for the price."
"The movie was great but the quality was very poor. I was only able to watch it once, since it would load anymore after we watched it."
"It is elegant and chic... I love it, the colour is wonderful for brunettes, the fabric is nice though it feels a bit heavy in the sleeves when they are rolled."
"They fit great colour is gorgeous and the material looks and feels good quality. I've not washed it yet. They suits up to hip."
"I bought this for my mom, It looks and feels good though the belt or sash it brings seems to be of a too much heavier fabric than the rest. In general looks and fits well."
"I am a medium and this one fits a bit too tight. Nice cuts at both sides. The fabric is a bit rough."
"I agree the sleeves are too long. Good material and beautiful colour combination. It is soft and looks elegant too"
"It feels soft and very warm. Sequin do not pinch your skin. Very nice material and looks elegant as well."
"It is beautifully soft and fresh though a bit translucent. The cut is original and suits wonderfully with jeans or office-like pants."
"I love items which look original in a way and I loved this one, the colour is gorgeous BUT the front fabric and the back one are different in texture one is soft and dropping fabric and the other is a bit more heavy so it falls somewhat queer."
"It is a beautiful shirt, soft and not so transparent as it shows in the pic. The colours are much more vivid than the picture. Looks great with jeans!"
"It was a good book right until the ending I cried the ending I did not enjoy it didn't wrap things up like I thought it would. Not only did many loving characters lost their lives but the heartbreaking sadness towards the end."
"It was an OK book if you ask me I would not buy it it isn't worth the money It is a poor book I'm glad I have prime"
"I was expecting something a little more structurally sturdy.  Once I opened the package I knew it wasn't going to be a good case. The front part is extremely flimsy and broke upon putting on my phone. I do not recommend this unless you are willing to &amp;#34;pay for what you get&amp;#34;. The shipping took too long and was definitely not worth the wait."
"me likey"
"It was not even a frozen doll...it was a cheap knock off...it said Bamin Anna on in....Im SO furious...this was for my daughters b-day..and I paid A LOT of money for it."
"I got this shirt it was so comfy and soft! A great shirt for an awesome price! The color and size look the same as in the picture. I would definitely order offer items from this company only downside is it takes a while for it to ship because its coming from China."
"101 Series - What every leader needs to know about Attitude drives home some of the core leadership principals. a good read for the leadership junkie!"
"SOCOM II U.S. Navy SealsSocom 2 is the greatest game ever made. Bring it back as a simple on-line playable download and you will make money. I have fought this fight for many years trying to bring Socom back to it's former glory but Sony seems to think we want COD style gameplay with a Socom name on the cover.Listen to the fans and bring Socom 2 back,, you know we are out here, just open your eyes."
"The finish on the wooden frame is really nice. I anticipated a big assembly project here and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it ended up being. The cloth cushion section is made of an outdoor type fabric as expected. I would recommend the item to others."

"This game is very addictive! I haven't had any problems!!! I recommend eveyone get this. Fun different games so you don't get bored and it makes it more interesting that you have to continue to play your unlocked games to earn more coins to unlock others! I already played 3 hours straight and I'm sure many more hours of fun are sure to follow"
"I am very happy with this product. The spring-loaded buttons on the side fits very snugly into the lighter socket. It charges my iPhone 5 at a high speed and stayed charging throughout, it never once fell out of the hole. It also has a very elegant, simple design. Once it is plugged in, a blue glow will indicate that it is ready to be used with adds an awesome effect especially when driving in the night. Another plus was that this product was also delivered very promptly as I received mine within a few days of purchasing it. All in all, this product is very sturdy and is certainly NOT a low quality charger. Im truly impressed with this product and it is definitely worth paying the price for its high quality."
"very very nice"
"The game is good it fit for me try it out its a cool game a lot of thing to do yeah so... try it"

"I ordered this shirt for my husband. He loves it. Good fit. Light material, still looks good after over 100 washes."
"I like this shirt a lot,I got too large of size but very cute and I can dress it up or down."
"Fits perfect, great material. good product I got it one size larger and it is perfect. The colors are great. Looks just as pictured."
"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this suit! It is made so well and looks amazing on. Like others have said this brand runs small. Order a size up. I'm very pleased. It looks like a high end bathing suit and I paid so little!"
"A little bit more challenging for the kiddies than the first one I downloaded.  Great game when we want to pass the time."
"My little artist girl really love this gadget.  She is very talented and this just broadened her talents even more.  I can't get her off.  Now I have to get one for me."
"I bought these for my kids to help them read when we are travelling at nights.  So far, so good. They work very well."

"Bought this book because I'd read a library copy, and was so pleased I knew I'd be reading it over &amp; over."
"Wow, this really stands up to the buzz about garcinia. My friends are happy about my weight loss, but what is amazing to me is how easy it makes it to not be hungry when I am usually craving snacks or sweets. I just have this relaxed easy feeling during the day that feels great. I feel energized but not hungry even during the later afternoons when we usually grab a coffee and a treat. I don't need the treats to get me through. I'm all about the occasional treat but now I feel like it's a choice rather than a quick sugar high to get me through the afternoon. I'm more than happy with the garcinia and like that it's natural and safe. The weight loss comes naturally without the snacking because I'm using up the fat stored in my hips - thank God!"
"worked out good"
"Came on time &amp; fits my phone perfectly. I have already bought the same protector in the past so I am a happy returning customer"
"It is quite pretty and my sister loved the ruffles. However the material is scratchy on the inside and the ruffles get rather flattened and crumpled during shipping. Also I'd say it needs thicker straps considering the dress isn't that light."
"easy to use; lightweight; it would be nice to have a strap since it needs to be hung up from a bulletin board."
"nice for the price will recomend if startind a low budget music system not bad at all if you want to hear your music clearly i really enjoy this product"
"I got this book for free fortunately because the first recipe I'm trying doesn't fit in the recommended jar size!  I've not even filled the jar 1/16! The book says just to add nuts, fruit, or chocolate chips to fill up the jar, but it's CHILI!!! So frustrated..."
"I like this product.  When the doctor said that it has to dissolve in your mouth, I was very leery.  I do not like things dissolving in my mouth but I got it.  I was very surprised.  It did not have a strong taste and did not taste bad at all.  My doctor did specify the 'Jarrow Formula'."
"after two months i still use this one. No problems it charges my batterry fast. my notebook is happy and full"

"It is a good stand by coffee you can count on.  I would reley on it for the daily use catagory."
"Much better than the Daybreak blend.  Much Bolder taste and better richness.  Could be a lil fresher though.  I would buy it again at lower price."
"It is an ok tea,not the best or worst.  It seems a lil weak if you ask me.  I wish it had a stronger taste!"
"I choose this rating because this phone has met  my expectation.  I like that it is easy and very friendly to users like me who are not so much into technology.  I am able to use most of the applications such as whatsup, viber, magic jack and so forth.  I can recommend to anyone that is into smart phone"
"Comes with no instructions so not for a newbie. Took  some time since i painted all the details. Looks okay. Not as great as  the St. Petersburg church puzzle."
"I could not find this cake topper any where. It was just what I wanted for my daughters birthday. She loved it and actually still plays with it."
"This balloon was so worth the money. It was huge when we had it blown up. It was the size of my 5 year old daughter who is love with Snow White. The party was Jan.11 and It is now end of Feb and I still have the balloon."
"I was forced to pay for two day shipping and was promised to get it before Christmas and i didn't get until after Christmas so I was forced to look like a jerk with no gift. And they are cheaply made. Memory Foam? More like forgetful foam."
"Belly Ring Dangle Navel Ring with CZ Stones 14G Belly Piercing 1.6mm Belly Ring Heart Spiral with Surgical Steel Bar 14 Gauge 7/16"" + 1 Free Belly Retainer - Choose your colorDaughter put it on and within one hour lost the stones out. I know the stones were not real but still disappointing. She did not even get to wear it all day. I would not buy this product again."
"I paid way more than i should of for uncirculated coins but i wanted them. Well when I got them they were all in a single plastic bag and they all had knicks and scratches. Worth only as pocket change. Never again!!!!! Liars!"

"TKS! THIS BATTERY IS AWESOME,GREAT QUALITY AND GOOD PRICE!!!  PERFECT!  I LOVE IT! HOPE THIS REVIWES IS HELPFUL.5 STARS! I WILL ORDER ANOTHER ONE LATER!"
"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this ring.  My only expectation is that it won't turn my finger green.  I think it's safe to say I got a lot more than what I expected.  The ring is heavy for it's size but to me that speaks of the quality of the material.  The matte finish is really nice and I've yet to scratch it after about a week of wearing it.  The smooth shiny sections are a great compliment to the matte finish.  For this price, it's a steal and you cannot find a better ring for the same price.  I highly recommend this ring to anyone looking for something that not your traditional wedding band.  You will love it!"
"The fit is really good but it does come with extra ear pieces just in case you should need a different size. The sound is really good and the bass is surprisingly good as well.  For the price it's hard to beat.  These in ear headphones actually compare reasonably well to some over ear headphones.  For the price I was actually expecting a weak bass sound but these are really good.  I've had these for a while now and they're still kicking and sounding great.  I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for some incredible headphones but don't want to pay over $100.  These are just as good as some of the $100+ headphones.  You won't regret it."
"I'm was initially hesitant to make this purchase but after reading some of the reviews, I went ahead and made the purchase.  I'm really glad I did.  This ring is solid and is surprisingly heavy for it's size.  To me that speaks of quality material and so far it's been exactly that.  It's beautiful and has a smooth shiny finish that seems to hold up well to everyday wear and doesn't seem to scratch easy.  The ring is true to size and fits me perfectly as a size 7 should.  I don't know why you would pay $100+ for a nice simple ring like this when you can have this for a fraction of that.  This is well worth the money, don't hesitate and buy it now."
"Fast shipping, more than I expected, and my girlfriend's kitty loves the grass! I have so many seeds I can share with friends. Perfect order!"
"These undies are cute and good quality; good price. Happy with them."

"These are indeed the best lights I ever owned. no tangling or muss love the case they come in for storage as well. Just wish there were multi color lights in this length as well. I am replacing on my old lights with these rope lights I use mine when camping but since we don't camp much in winter I am using them at christmas as well to decorate my porch. you can't loose with this purchase."
"I had went and got my hair done at the beauty salon and they use this product in my hair and it was so beautiful I couldn't believe how silky and long looking my hair was it was a great feeling try it and this oil will leave your hair feeling so good and silky you would always want to put in hair no lies this is not a scam just try it and buy it."

"The story was excellnt and went so fast that I still wanted more.  Excellent author, I'd read again. More by this author..."
"Spellbinders are my favorites of all the dies and you'll love them too, specially if you love intricacy in your pattern. The Parisian  dies are super because they are lockable so you can build on your art.  If you purchase any or all you will find they are certainly worth the effort they take to remove them from the paper.  Just remember to use wax paper."
"I love the bird theme.  Specially the choice of sizes makes it easy to use in many applications.  The large cage is larger than I  thought it would be which makes it nice to take up a larger area on the card and of course you have two sizes of birds.  Very nice!"
"I've used this with my Fuse by Fiskars, and it is truly beautiful.  Buy it, you'll love it too. Yummy."
"Hood Love was a page turner from the beginning to the end. I loved Nae and Capo. I can't wait til part 2 come out.I read this book in one day. Do anybody know when part 2 come out?"

"For the longest time I was beyond words after I started reading this book.It's taken me a few weeks to recompose my senses enough to write this review! But unlike many of the other 1-star reviews, I'm not going to discourage people from picking up this book.Actually, I ENCOURAGE it, so you can see for yourself just how absurd its premises are.  But instead of handing over your $$ to line Amanda Byrne's pocketbook, seriously, please instead check this book out from a library/borrow a copy from a friend/find free passages online.I don't know what is more disturbing... the actual content of the book or the fact that it was even green-lighted to begin with. And Oprah!  Dear beloved Oprah!  How COULD you endorse a book that teaches ""If you see people who are overweight do no observe them but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect body and feel it.""Selling  this to the masses has just as many frightening implications as  ""If you see people who are Jewish do not observe them but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect race and feel it""  (And we all know that the mental ""snuffing"" of Jews didn't just end there....)If you think, ""Well, that's an exaggerated comparison.  Rhonda Byrne is not implying the genocide of fat people"" well think again.  Rhonda Byrne may not be advocating physical genocide but she certainly is advocating the mental kind, encouraging her readers to embrace the US vs THEM mentality...  ""Us"" being the superior, the thinner, the richer (the ""straight"", etc) and ""them"" being anyone who is not ""us"".A person who finds their identity through such a skewed mentality can become so desensitized to ""them"" that violence against ""them"" often can and does erupt, whether it is the murder of one..... or 6 million.And to think, regarding """"events in history where masses of lives were lost,""  The Secret has the audacity to say, """"By the law of attraction, they had to be on the same frequency as the event.""  So, according to the ""law"" of attraction, they basically wished and thought it upon themselves until it became true?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(The exclamation points are  a polite summary  of what I was REALLY thinking... I have to keep my review G-rated, you know)Amanda Byrne must have never read Holocaust survivor Elie Wisel's book ""Night"".  Or if she has, she probably did not ""observe"" any of Wisel's horrific written  accounts, and rather envisioned her own ""perfect""  book and the millions of dollars she would rake in!!!Ahem. Moving on....A quote at the beginning of the same paragraph about weight reads: """"Make it your intention to look for, admire, and inwardly praise people with your idea of perfect-weight bodies.""Is it any wonder, then, that people (mainly women and young girls) end up obsessing over their own bodies and develop eating disorders?Another paragraph from this book which just rubbed me raw was:""Whether we realize it or not, we are thinking most of the time. If you are speaking or listening to someone, you are thinking. If you are reading the newspaper or watching television, you are thinking. When you recall memories from your past, you are thinking. When you are considering something in your future, you are thinking. When you are driving, you are thinking. When you are getting ready in the morning, you are thinking.""Gee, I'm not sure I get the point.  Do you think she's trying to tell me that I am thinking?I can't even begin to tell you how completely turned off I was when I read this:""Everything that surrounds you right now in your life, including the things you're complaining about, you've attracted. Now I know at first blush that's going to be something that you hate to hear.... And I'm here to be a little bit in your face and to say, yes you did attract it""I'm sorry... even if the ""law"" you are speaking of (on authority, of course) really is 100% fact, if you feel you have to ""get in my face"" to make me believe it, well, then you're insulting my intelligence.  Real experts in real sciences don't HAVE  to get in anybody's face to convince them of anything.  (I've never heard of physicists/scientists/academic professors having to get  in people's faces to prove the law of gravity.)And besides, no matter what point someone is trying to make, whether it be about this so-called law or about something as ordinary as an opinion of a new song out on the radio, if it is expressed along with an ""in-your-face"" attitude, I'm not going to take to the message - even if I happen to agree with it - very kindly.The problem with ""The Secret"" is that the quotes I referenced above are not the only disturbing / damaging / insulting ones to be found.  The book is FULL of them.  Don't believe me?  Read the book to find out for yourself.In conclusion, the only explanations I can come up with for the baffling number of 5-star reviews for ""The Secret"" are:1. Real people are writing about their real experiences with positive thinking, but mistakenly attribute  the positive things happening in their lives  to having read and espoused ""The Secret"" - as opposed to the fact that they actually worked hard for what they got, or they just had plain dumb luck.2. Reviewers actually wrote a negative review,  but didn't realize they accidentally selected 5 stars (if you read the 5-star reviews, you'll see what I'm talking about)3. Shameless investors / promoters of this book have inflated the number of 5-star reviews to pump up salesP.S.  Oprah I love you and I truly believe you the light for so many people.  I hope to see you one day stand up to ""The Secret""!!  Even if it means having to backtrack your endorsement.  You did it with James Frey, so you can do it with Amanda Byrne!"
"We first brought one, then shortly later brought 2 more. Such a great product. Strong and sturdy &amp; much cheaper than the cheaper made ones at the store!!"
"This is my first time buying poppy seeds for pst but they worked perfectly and had really good effects. Very enjoyable and very relaxing and quick shipping and nice packaging."
"AWFUL. They are totally washed and clearly a lot of these reviews are fake, and i would never buy again for PST. What a waste."
"So far...so good with this new Melitta coffeemaker. I've used it every day since it arrived. I looked and researched all types and makes and finally decided to get this one based on the previous reviews and past experience with Melitta products. In the past my luck with new coffeemakers has not been very good so I was really reluctant to even buy another one. Hopefully this machine will continue to be a solid purchase."
"Bought this to replace my controller from 2009 that came with the console, and I'm disappointed that the triggers and analog sticks squeak."
"This is the second time I have bought these and both times I love them for a few months.The problem is, after a few months the grip begins to separate from its holder and leaves you with the grip falling off. Stronger glue is needed. I will not be buying a third time."
"This was the first novel I read by Jason Gehlert. As with any first time author I read, I am always skeptical of what I am diving in to but do so with an open mind. From the start, Jeremiah captured my attention with a pretty intriguing story line. It is hard to find originality (in my opinion) in a genre such as this but Jason has found gold with this storyline. Making a deal with the Devil sounds like an exotic idea, but the inner demons that are faced as a result of what must be carried out can weigh heavily on a person. I didn't know whether to hate or to love main character Jeremiah Black, and that was the beauty of this book. As the story moves on, you think you know what is coming next and then you are taken in a completely unexpected turn that leads to another great subplot. Just a fun, good paced read that has some pretty interesting twists with each turn of the page. As a first time reader of this author, I cannot wait to see what comes next from this amazing talent."
"All in all, it was a very good read. It started out as just another &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; guide, but it very quickly turned into an informative wheelhouse and I was able to set up a few new methods of promoting myself as I read it. I have read a few similar books and they all say the same thing - which isn't much - but Seumas definitely helped me to get a few more platforms going that I wouldn't otherwise have thought about. If you're looking for some good pointers and a guiding hand through the process, this is the book for you!"
"waoooh...this book enligthened my life...!I'm...different! Nothing is the same since our first meeting, and I used to go through it daily ...as kind reminder for my self.I red the monk too.... seems like I &amp;#34;slept&amp;#34; during 25 years...!"
"These are my first running shoes, and love them soooo much. I just ordered another one in periwinkle/sun color. My feet are a bit wide, and feared that the (B) size won't fit, but I have enough room.I also bought the nimbus 14 but didn't give them a try yet, but love the fit!"
"Overall this is a really good eyeliner that is a lot easier to apply than many others I have had in the past. It won't smudge and lasts a long time."
"Perfect lens! Good quality and an amazing  sharpiness and also  the bokeh give a good effect! Perfect for photography and video And fast shipping"
"What a great book!!  All of the stories were good but I have to say the cover story was my favorite.  I will be looking forward to the next publication with hopes of seeing more from the same authors."

"I am not satisfied with the product. Is not what I have expected.Not enough information to lure in the usersI would not recomand it."
"The sander works well, feels well and does a great job, but the switch problem almost caused my shop to burn down. I noticed that you really had to make sure that the switch was off or it might turn itself back on even hour later. I wonder if it was from the shop gewtting colder at night. The first time it happened it ruined a knotty alder door, after that I made a point of always unplugging when i when I was done, even if just for a few minutes. The last time I was in my shop I was called away and forgot to unplug. I was away for two weeks and came back to find the sander laying on my hardwood shop floor and a deep groove cut by the sanders edge running until it got hot enough to kick the electrical breaker. It very easily could have caught the shop on fire.Sending back and writing dewalt alert them."

"I was so excited to get this in the mail...When I opened it the silver foil does not go all the way to the edge where the silver lip is and just ruins it...I would return it but it's not worth the cost to do so I am keeping it..."
"I have had this case for a while and there is nothing wrong with how it is manufactured just the color. It has turned an ugly yellow brown color. I have tried everything to clean it even bleach! but nothing works. If you want an okay case get this case just in a different color."
"I received my package; however there was nothing in it.  The package was open and item missing; nothing but the receipt was in the envelope. That was disappointing due to the fact that I needed the item right away."
"I learned a lot about lace wigs and types of glue.  I have tried three types of glue and nothing seems to work"
"I wasn't sure they would be bright enough to light the interior of my small rv. They surprised me. I cut the strip in half and ran one down the underside of the cupboards on each side. Used a male plug from the charger of an old cordless drill I had for one and the female out of the drill for the other. Hooked them up,ran them to a switch and it's as bright as day in there in the middle of the darkest  night. I would recommend these to my friends and anyone else who wants inexpencive lighting for a motor home  or anything 12vdc. I need no other lights in mine.. Thanks, It's been my pleasure."
"Bought this product because I was tired of measuring too little or too much detergent. It's also much easier to carry 1 pod in a laundry bag then a whole bottle. Cleans my clothes really well and leaves them smelling nice afterwards."
"This is the first time I've ever written a review about anything, but after the horrible experience I've had with this case, I'm hoping to save a few other people some frustration.  I had trouble right away with this case.  First, the screen portion had air bubbles in it and was wavy, making it hard to use the touch screen on the phone.  Then, when it got so bad that I couldn't press the END button to end a call, I decided to contact the company. After waiting on hold for about twenty minutes, the CSR informed me that it was a counterfeit case.  So, since this was given to me as a Christmas gift, I'm not the only victim... my mother in law, who gave it to me, is out the money she paid for it.  I am beyond aggrivated at this point.  Please, DO NOT buy this case."
"I liked this book. It was different. I agree with another review, that it was weird to see that Logan went to school the next day after his mother was murdered. Who does that. But all in all I did like this book. I will be reading other books by Shayla Black."
"I used this in conjunction with the Green Coffee Bean Exract and I lost 10lbs. in 2 weeks. The price is great here. I bought the green coffee bean and rasberry ketone from a health store and it cost me $70.00 for both. Here I bought both and added the african mango extract for $45.87. Can't beat that. This is an all natrual product made by Essential Source, you can check their website and read about all the products they offer. I'm still waiting on my order hopefully will come in soon. I've been out for about a week and I can tell a difference in how I feel. I'm back to feeling blah. I hate that feeling. Hope this helps anyone wanting to try. Oh and it doesn't taste to bad, reminds me of a cough syrup. But you only take it 2x a day under the tongue for about 30 seconds then swallow."

"When one of my older two speed  battery Dremels gave up, I felt it was time to give a power hitter a try. It needs to be used with a flex shaft attachment as otherwise it to bulky to use with accuracy, but i iallready have a Fordom.  For other users and uses it is a great tool with power to spare."

I was forced to buy the Brooks which hurt my feet and fell apart.  I found the Asics GEL-Extreme 33 on Amazon for a great price and bought them.  My feet are thanking me and I'm back to running.  I just completed 500 miles, and am heading to 1,000 miles.  Asics never let me down."

"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*I&amp;#8217;ll start off by saying thank to the author for allowing me to be one of the lucky people who received an ARC copy of this book. In case I somehow fail to make the point in my review the most important thing to know about this book is that it is really good and if you have not read it yet, you should.One of the things I noticed and liked about the book was the pacing. Normally an author will go slow and set up the story and each character so that you get to know them properly before the conflict of the book starts. While that is a good thing for books that are longer, it also means that for me at least since the good part is hardly in the beginning I am able to put the book down and come back to it later. This one however jumps right into the storyline without feeling rushed.I loved Jenna&amp;#8217;s character. It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I read a book with strong heroine who doesn&amp;#8217;t lose her mind and opinion just because of a guy. Jenna was an independent and strong woman who did not back down to others despite them trying to intimidate her. I mean to go back to the small town where your mom got caught sleeping with the mayor and led you to being a victim of the vicious rumor mill takes some serious lady balls. Another thing I loved about Jenna was her loyalty. Without revealing spoilers, I will say that Jenna&amp;#8217;s attitude towards some people was very admirable despite what was happening. Like I said earlier, she was a strong character who did base her actions on a guy.The relationship between her and Josh I really liked how he did not judge her despite of the rumors. I loved how protective he was of her and although sometimes his actions were misguided at times, I never doubted his feelings for her. Josh frustrated me with how he reacted to some things but it wasn&amp;#8217;t until the end that it all made more sense although I could still not justify what he had done. However his redeeming quality was that he was just caught in a difficult situation and he was trying to do his best to deal with it.My one complain about the book is the length. Now I&amp;#8217;m not sure if it&amp;#8217;s because I'm used to reading 250+ page books that anything under that just seems like too little or that it was actually a little short. But yeah while the story was not rushed at all I would have liked for it to be a little longer and see some interaction between Jenna and other people who weren&amp;#8217;t Josh.As far as the ending is concerned I have to say that I have had my fair share of experience with books where I do not like the ending. Then after a couple of days of thinking about it I will sometimes realize that the author had a good point in ending the book the way that they did (except for you John Green, your endings kill me). This book was no exception, I had mixed feelings about it at first but now I am glad that the author chose to end it that way because it was true to the type of person that Jenna was."
"I heartily recommend this book to health care providers working with the chronically ill, as well as faculty preparing providers to work with people living with chronic illness. In a world with myriad definitions of ""health"" and ""healing"", chronic illness cannot be fixed with medicine or surgery. Using a mix of personal stories and simple truths, Ms. Amsden's thoughtful and engaging book proposes a new way of looking at our lives, and our journeys. Medicine absolutely plays an important role, and it is most effective when people can approach it with a positive outlook. Share this book with your students. Share this book with each of your patients. Wherever life finds us, this elegant collection of stories prepares us for true healing."

"I have owned this cookbook for years and I wanted a copy to give to my daughter.  The chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe is delicious."
"This book really shows a person what it means to have Gods grace. When a person has Gods grace no matter what trial or tribulation that he or she might be going through with his grace you will know everything will be alright."
"I remember reading this book as a kid. I saw it on kindle store and bought it. I was a little shocked when no one else in the house had heard it before. I read it to my grand daughter and she loved it and enjoyed the pictures very much."
"The first time I started reading this book, life interrupted. When I finally got back to it I had to restart it. It is a good book. One the will make it into my favorites. I appreciate that Jolie isn't led by her hormones as so many women in books are these days. She is also strong, but still needs her friends to center her without using them as a crutch."
"I found this in the children's section of kindle books. This is not a children's book! This book is a soapbox for the author. And the poems are not ""inspirational"" at all. The author trying to label this a children's book is the most horrifying part of all. I understand her desire to teach children to find other supplements to replace what is found in meat, but there is nothing on God's green earth that would compel me to read this book to a child. I do have a question though, near the end of the book, she writes about a mouse that got inside her house. She does not say how she got it out of her house, why not?"
"I like games that aren't too easy. This one is definitely not too easy. It's also got a nice mix of games. My biggest problem with it is that it keeps wanting you to advertise for them in facebook. I don't go on Facebook and definitely don't want to let everyone know all my guilty pleasures. I wish that like sound effects there was a button so you could turn this off. Also, game lost the star because it asked me after every chapter to leave a review. If I like your game I won't need to be asked to review it. This should b knocked back to every fourth or fifth level. I didn't hit the don't ask again because I intended to leave one....so fix your game so it stops pestering people."
"Kids have clumsy finger. Please fix the size of images n number dots. Loves the amount of images. Don't recommend til updated with larger images."
"Sat down with my 4 yr old granddaughter thinking we would have a fun few minutes. Did not happen. A lot of the differences are miniscule. She quickly grew bored. I challenged others to spot the differences and no-one I asked could find all the differences. If u want a challenge then this is for you."
"It is a fun game. Putting picture together myself to get answer would've been better. Not sure I trust an app that pays for ratings within first ten pics"
"So i picked out a few of the free puzzles, one of them was the sea shells pack. I was down to the last two pieces. I looked at the last two pieces, then went back and swiped my finger over the puzzle to see if I had messed up. Nope, the last two pieces didn't fit the two spaces I had left. I realize I am using a free puzzle but this doesn't induce to buy the app. Otherwise I love the game and enjoy playing. Except when I have left over pieces that don't fit puzzle."
"Within 5 minutes of play and after about as many pics they are willing to &amp;quot;pay&amp;quot; for a review....makes me wonder why. I like the concept of the game, I hope the product can meet expectations."
"This book has it all. The pictures are amazing. But the author did an amazing telling the story of the butterflies life cycle with beautiful pictures. I recommend this book to everyone."
"I downloaded this app the last time it was offered for free because of the rave reviews. I didn't play it more than an hour before removing it from my kindle. It just didn't hold my interest. I wish I understood the reasoning behind offering it a second time. It's not that good an app."
"I got this app as faotd. I listen to audiobooks and play this game to unwind before bed. Problem is if I don't set an alarm I lose track of time, which in my opinion is what makes a good app. It has enough settings to let you choose exactly how difficult  you want it. The animations are cute but eats the batteries."
"I have a lot of mahjong games...both free and paid for.  This one has just replace a couple of my others as one I will play regularly. It has a lot of boards in the free game and a lot more to unlock if I want to buy it...which I probably will."
"I can appreciate wanting to try to help others by sharing your expertise. However, proofreading is really mandatory if English is not your first language. I read the reviews before getting this but thought it couldn't be that bad. I'm sorry, but it's worse. Ms. Martin please make the effort to have this edited. You've got me curious now as to exactly what square hooks and Japan hooks are, not to mention what some of the other information refers to.  I am always hungry to know more, and if you fix this I guarantee I will update my review."
"If you buy the tulip kit this book probably covers what's in each kit.  I found this book to be sparse. I expected to see a pic at end of each project. Especially since some were done in different colors from beginning pic. Gave four stars because it is what it says. Unfortunately what isn't said is that it is one long tulip tie dye commercial."
"Purchased 12 of these units for conducting roadside work.  They work well for their purpose, but with wear and tear, the top cap falls off and becomes unusable (until duct tape is applied).  Aside from that, a good purchase based on price, but needs to be handled with care.  Not designed to be used as miniature lightsabres, but can withstand this type of abuse."
"This screen was a perfect fit for my sony xperia play.  I have been using the replacement part for a few months now and it is operating with no issues.Screen allows for a easy repair job and can be done in approximately 10 minutes.  Well worth the money for the part versus a new phone or paying someone else to fix."
"Fell apart after first use. Prongs got stuck in my iPhone. Very poor craftsmanship. Poor quality materials used. But it was pretty."
"Love this book!  I can not wait for the next one! If any one is interested in a good series, the White House Chef is the one to read.  The recipes are great too!"
"The product works great.  Better than I ever thought it would work.  I would highly recommend this product to people"

"This is the funniest book I can remember reading, I laughed out loud through the whole thing, have read Marian Keyes before and this is her best so far. Can't wait to read about the rest of the Walsh sisters!"
"A beautiful book inside and out.  Charles helps us step into the new world story with humble grace and intelligence."
"THE PRODUCT IS IN GOOD CONDITION THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT FREEZES UP EVERY SO OFTEN AND HAD TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES IF I COULD DO IT OVER I WOULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE BUT ITS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO ONLY PLAYS WITH IT EVERY SO OFTEN SO WORTH THE MONEY."
"A very bad quality it is very expensive and it is diferent in the picture. Idon't like at all. Sorry"

"This is a beautiful leather case.  I thought I had ordered brown, but apparently not as I received a black one.  Exceptional quality."
"A real leather designer wallet at a great price. Removable Id holder is very handy. Plenty of room for credit cards."
"I used this book years ago when teaching graduate courses in educational leadership.  I was impressed by the steps recommended to involve students (adults, too, for that matter) in conflict resolution decision making.  While dated now, it still has value for anyone teaching or tutoring hard-to-reach or jaded high school students and trying to understand where their discontent resides. I sent the book to a person who is tutoring such students now in a charter school setting."
"I like Joan Walsh's politics, and her views in this book generally fit what I have come to expect from her.  Content both supports and criticizes the white majority's difficulties in accommodating liberal social, political and economic concerns.  Book is comaparable to other liberal leaning assessments of domestic American life."
"Its easy to install and hopefully will last longer than the three years the first one did.  It seems sometimes my two dogs both want to enter/exit at the same time and that was the cause of failure of separtation of one of the segments.  Nowhere in the instructions does it tell me how to teach my dogs, ladies first to avoid this problem."
"The characters are unpredictable &amp; Norma somehow believes everything's okay with her sultry adolescent demeanor and ways. Love it! You never know what will conspire next. Next season, I'll wait to purchase the whole season because it drives me crazy waiting for the next episode."
"I am very particuliar about the wallets I purchase.  It must have several card slots and at least 2 zipper compartments.  This wallet has that and more! It is so soft and the zipper work great.  the front compartment is perfect for change. I got the Espresso color and I love it.  It holds my checkbook and I still have room for extra things if needed.  I would usually never pay this much for a wallet, but I got tired of the cheapies breaking on me.  This is very well made and I should have this for years to come.  I would highly recommend this to everyone :)"
"The words were simple enough for my niece and nephew to follow along with and they loved the bright, vibrant colors and pictures. I loved the message behind the story though. Children tend to need a little help understanding feelings and this is a great story to help them learn!"
"Very strong in the beginning, but taste does fade quickly. Wish it would last a little but longer, but still very good!"
"i love my new island. I had to have a contractor put it together for me, but it was well worth it. The only thing is one of the cabinet doors were a tad off, but no biggy! Also, the corners stick out further, so watch it when you're standing up close and go to walk away... I stub my toes on them all the time!"

"I love this game I have found myself playing for hours in one sitting. Ads never get in the way I barely notice them. I love that you can play against the computer in solo games and that it does not force me to play on line with friends. I have never had a problem with the game. I highly recommend it."
"It's a great price and the size is perfect! The air feels clean and fresh, I highly recomend these! They are better than other filters"
"I bought this for my mother-in-law who just got this cell phone and Iy Didnt fit right. It hangs of the side."

"Unfortunately, Exposed did not work for my skin. In fact, it made it worse after using it for two months. It made my skin extremely oily and break out more than normal. I did return the product."
"This fragrance is super cheap, yet smells great. My son loved it and so do I.  His first fragrance, and will buy again, plus it's name brand. If you haven't smelled, do give it a try. I doubt you'll be disappointed."
"Freezes my kindle every time. Had to uninstall. Really wanted to play with my toddler daughter. Thought it was an adorable idea and game."
"Really creative and super cute. Pick up trash cans, kids from school, deliver mail... All from different vehicles. I bought the full version, but well worth it. Try !"
"Fits good, no bulk. Loosens up a little, and will slide down. Sure I can fix it . Cute and worth the money."
"What's not to like . It's like Candy Crush but the graphics are more enticing and appealing. Simple consistent game play. Cute, cute, cute..."
"My 4 year old and myself love this. Lego games are often complicated. This is perfect for younger kids who love the Lego getup but are to young for the system games. Hope for upgrades or more of the same types of games. No ads !!!"
"I received this product two weeks after ordering,what made it so bad was i tracked this item an it was.in my city to only end up in the next state the following day.i was not at all impressed an i would never order from them AGAIN!!!"

"This is a really great glove for the price. They are definitely not a weather glove, but for warmer weather above 55 degrees, they are perfect. Very comfortable, and I am able to feel the movements of the throttle well with them. Very durable material so far. Will see how they last thru the season."
"This was good  book. I thought it was a little too short. It left out information that should have been in it for the  price.  I would recommend  I  for a good read; th  price would be adjusted."
"Fine book.... interesting... to read.. learned a tick or two.. guess I'm pleased on how it went about.so again I say..Fine book.."
"Chill is a water skylander, which means she can swim in water (unless you can fly over it). Overall, she is very speedy in the game and has a good long range attack throwing a ice spear. Although, her figure is fragile and she dies easily if it is against a bark demon or a arkean sniper. Basic thing is, the spear does everything. If you don't get the spear path, you'd do 14 damage. But if you did, it would do over 20 damage. At first she looked well, bad, but when i found out her catch phrase was ""Stay cool"" , well that got me. So it might not be that bad if you bought her at least she isn't like drobot. Come one people lightcore is only 12.99 while normal is 9.99. I hope you like my review. Leave any comments or questions about Skylanders Giants. :-)"
"Is it a yeti or an ice man? No its the fierce yeti of the water element, Slam Bam. Despite not being a giant, Slam Bam is one power house with his four arms. He'll devastate anything in his way. This is one must have skylander in your collection. His upgrades paths; his brawler fighter path, and his ice prison path. Both are very good but when you get to his soul gem, you need to find it in Empire of Ice which in this single character pack, does not come with. So you have to buy another Slam Bam with his adventure pack. Overall, you would still be pleased with him throughout the game. I hoped you liked my review. Leave any comments or questions about Skylanders Giants. :-)"
"Crusher is both strong and sturdy, but slow. Even though, he is ""rocking"" awesome in the game. His eyes light blue and so does his left side shoulder armor which lights up green on his crystals he has there. Both of his upgrades paths are good too. If you are a ""I'll crush you"" person, choose his hammer path. But if you are an offence kinda person, you should go with his rock slide path. I hope you liked it. Tell me any comments or other questions you have with Skylanders Giants. :-)"
"love this book!!! even 20 years later when i can read it to my daughter...the Bernstein bears never disappoint...highly recommend"
"It didn't fit in my g&amp;g cm16 raider long. don't buy it if u have a combat machine, or just don't buy it at all!!!"

"Adapter does not work at all and the connector that goes to the laptop is loose. Also, capacity of adaptor is lower than that ordered."
"I've used this lightbox for ten years and it's made a huge difference in the quality of my life in the fall and winter. This is the box used in national research that proves the effectiveness of light therapyon depression and SADD. Lumens are important in a lightbox and this one is the best. The bulbs last a long time and I've only had to replace them once in ten years. If you're looking for quality, this is the one."
"This is a thinking person's movie. It is experiential as well as cerebral. I dont know if I'll ever understand all of it and thats ok. It might be intended to be that way.It is hard to imagine how the actors, writers and directors accomplished this.  All deserve high praise. Roger Ebert gave it 4 out of 4 stars and watched it three times, which is exactly what I'm going to do. If not 4 or 5 times."
"Was not the movie that you would expect however he should have an oscar for this one, my friend that i got the movie for would rather see balls to the walls JCVD"
"Great tool just a complete waste of time and money. U install tool before u pull timing chains at tdc to hold camshafts from turning while u pull heads. Problem is there are two bolts under holder u then have to remove holder to remove bolts to get the head off. So u have to put camshafts back in time anyway."

"It wasn't too long ago when I found about baoding balls, so I was just buying random ones and trying them out.  These are pretty lightweight and come with a beautiful-sounding chime.  They're pretty easy to work with, even for a beginner like me (okay, the tiny ones I had were more difficult to work with than these).  It won't be long until I start working with heavier, or bigger ones.  But I got these, multiples, to work with over time.  The designs on these are really beautiful, and so far they haven't worn out or anything.  I definitely recommend these to the beginners who want to work with something light.  If you don't like listening to chimes, then I suggest you opt out of this one."
"I appreciate that the Stamper/Scraper worked very well.  However, I would appreciate it more if the bottom of the stamper was the translucent white that the picture of the product shows.  I got one with a dark, hot pink bottom.  If I were to use pink or a red-related stamping polish with this stamper, it would be hard for me to work with because it would be difficult to see.  Luckily, I used a white stamping polish with this.  It works really well, easy to get the hang of even if you're a beginner like me.  I think the seller should give us the choice to buy pink or white bottom separately, instead of having a picture different from the product.  That's the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.  Don't let this discourage you from getting it, it's still a well-working product."

"I wanted to buy my boyfriend some warm clothes and I came across this sweatshirt. Considering the brand and price I thought it was an awesome deal. He likes it. It came on time, the only thing is there was a tiny hole in the stitching by the shoulder. Super easy fix so no complaints."

I like my shirts fitted, but this is just a bit too tight (although not enough for me to return it or chose not to wear it!)."
"This is totally not what I expected, it's better. Really fun if you are into RPGs. If you play LoL or WoW, you might like this. Or if you're just looking for some old-school fun. If you have money to spend, buy this!"
"It is what it is. Sender sent promptly. I wish it worked for More than just charging.  The product is better than buying a new cable for my car."

"Ratio of US to World favored US too much.  World maps did not always have the detail I would have liked.  Overall, the information basicly was more than adequate.  Good job on that part."
"This film provides much information about the people who established the background for the ideals from which the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution of the United States were written.  It makes it clear that many U.S. Supreme Court rulings in the last fifty years are based on PERSONAL FEELINGS of the Supreme Court Judges, not on the precepts of the U. S. Constitution."

"I miss Ziva, but they did a good job of finding her replacement. Bishop seems to fit right in with the team. Overall it has been a great season so far."
"The Seller did properly describe the trap set tool, as for it's intended use, but it is worthless when trying to set the strong heaver body grip traps like the Duke #280, #330 etc., this devise does work for smaller traps like the Duke #110, but you can set this trap with your hands, so the tool is not needed, in my opinion this tool is near being worthless to use on large body grip traps, for which it was advertised to set, again it does work to set the small, maybe to medium size traps, but again, I just don't trust it for setting larger traps like the Duke #280, or #330 sizes, my reason for thinking this is that the handles on this set tool are to short, and you can't get enough leverage to easily, or safely set the large traps (the tool only measures 20 inches long), and too, I don't trust the small pivot bolt that connects each half of the tools steel handles together, it does not appear to be made of case hardened steel, and under heavy pressure I think it might break, and may cause injury to the user, but it's just my opinion, and other peoples opinions may differ.  The price was right, but in my opinion the tool is almost worthless to set large traps, and again, just not sure about the safety aspect, or quality issues of this tool.  ""You Will Have To Use Your Own Judgement"", as too, if you should Purchase This Tool"" !"
"This knife sharpener will sharpen your knife, but you must be really careful as not to have an accident, and cut the hand (fingers) that hold the body of the knife sharpener, if not super careful it would be easy for the sharpener to slip in your fingers, and cause a painful cut to your hand, or fingers.  Again the knife sharpener will sharpen your knife, but just use caution as to finger placement while sharpening your knife.  Final Note:  &amp;#34;This Knife Sharpener Will Sharpen Your Knife&amp;#34; !"
"This Duke #280 Conibear Body Trap has awesome body grip holding power when it snaps shut, and I believe it's legal to use in most of the US, and with it's 8"" jaw spread it should work well for trapping (Coyotes),  again it has lot's of griping power so "" Be Careful Setting Up This Conibear Body Grip Trap "", it's very powerful, and it can hurt you in a flash if you're careless, always use the proper safety equipment to set this trap up for use !"

"Item delivered on time and well packaged, slip case a bit worn. Essential Diana Rigg episodes from 1965 in B&amp;W. It's called '65 DVD Set 2 (in case you get as confused as I do with the chronology nomenclature). Volumes 3 &amp; 4. Vol 3: The Murder Market, A Surfeit of H2O, The Hour That Never Was. Vol 4: Dial a Deadly Number, Man-eater of Surrey Green, Two's a Crowd, and bonus episode Too Many Christmas Trees."
"It was great to see a classic redone in HD. While immediately a critic's choice when released, it took a while for the general public to catch up with the unnerving and stark realism of the film. It's nice to finally own one of my top 10 movies in Blu-ray."
"The delivery was on time, well packaged, and met the description parameters. However, I had hoped it would be a little more substantial. Very light and thin metal, and very cheap looking. It looks like something you would find in a Dollar Store. Definitely not worth the price and I do not recommend it."
"Item packaged well and delivered on time. Nicely painted, easy to hang and light. Fit my space perfectly, and held a nice variety of spice bottle sizes. Just a little pricey for a few slats of painted wood. Recommended."
"This case was crap it was really lose and then. The pieces fell apart in the box Dont buy it. They forced me to give it a star.. smh"
"This book is amazing! The best book I have ever read!! I would absolutely recommend this book to everyone!! It really makes one think about things. It has made me lose my fear of dying!"
"I loved this cd it was even better than I projected it being! I have allways loved this band they need to keep up with with these amazing albums they make"

"Enjoy it thoroughly has helped me tremendously. Well suggest to all my friends this is why I chose kindle to begin with!!!!!"

"Victor does it again. Enjoy the music and dance your passion away. He will make you move all the time with his voice and style."

"Good salsa and lyrics ok. Good to lessen to on a sunny day. Also to relax with good friends. Enjoy and have fun."
"I expected just a little bit more of this movie. I found it to much exaggeration. None the less, ok to watch. enjoy it!!!"
"This is the best new cd I have bought in a long time. I don't buy new music very often because I rarely hear anything that captures my attention until this band came along. I discovered them by accident on YouTube. These guys are excellent song writers and have amazing vocal harmonies. I think anyone who is Beatles fan will truly appreciate what these guys do. I have no idea why they aren't more famous. I look forward to hearing more from them in the future. My only complaint of the cd is the lyrics aren't in it."
"I was so excited when this book was finally available. I had been reading about it's development and could hardly wait to get my hands on it. It did not disappoint. I could hardly stand to put it down. This book is Spirit lead and Spirit filled.I learned a lot that I did not yet know. Slowly I am getting braver about putting it into practice.

"It is entertaining, educational and challenging. Helps keep the mind working. Kid friendly. I am enjoying the challenge and thinking it through. It has cute pictures too."
"The book and dust cover arrived in perfect condition with no creases or tears. Mint condition, first edition, perfect!Many people didn't care for the Goblet of Fire, but I can't understand why that is. It's longer which is a plus for me as I love my Harry Potter fix. It delved into the everyday lives, struggles, and thought processes of the characters and studied them more which was very interesting, entertaining and fun. It also kept building up to a year's end which was epic in every way imaginable.J.K. Rowling is a master with twist endings and misleading her readers to think they know everything that's going on the school of Hogwarts, only to school them in just how powerful magic is and what can happen when that power is put in the wrong hands. If you're a fan of the first three books, keep reading. It only gets better from here on."
"It wasn't stiff at all the first few rolls which is a problem with a lot of rollers. The paper fits absolutely perfectly, and it rolls my cigarettes to the perfect size (as thick as store-bought cigs, not thin like Misty's). It's very sturdy, and I've had no problems since my purchase. This is the roller to get my friend!"
"Loved it,very clear and concise.I actually read it 20 years ago,but ,I didn't own a sextant then.It makes a lot more sense now.Thank you."
"You only get to play like 5 little short challenges. It's basically the tutorial parking. Then you have to buy the game. This is only good to try before you buy. If you want to see if you'll like it then download it  but if you want the game you gotta buy it or find a different app. Controls are good though"
"Great tool for taking temp readings while staying safe with motors running. I have used it on everything from radiators, AC units to engine parts. A bonus was it came with the battery so I didn't have to scrounge around for one or worse yet make a special trip to the store for it."

"I wish that we had known about Autism and Aspergers back when I was growing up and I sure wish we had this book. Living Independently is well written and although an easy read Lynne in no way talks 'down' to anyone. I have re-read some parts of this book only because I wanted to commit them to memory. I am very much looking forward to Lynne's next endeavor."
"Attack of the Customers will help anyone trying to anticipate or defend a customer attack delivered/fueled through social media. Especially useful in large-scale product/service organizations with public brands that are worth defending and protecting.Attack of the Customers is approachable reading, with stories that will either be familiar or relevant throughout. Gillin and Gianforte view what were high-profile PR crises through the lens of history, and focus instead on how social media was relevant to those events. For example, the beef industry's lack of preparedness for the ""pink slime"" incident, where consumer outrage over the industry's practice of using ""lean finely-textured beef"" to make processed foods boiled over, is surprising in hindsight.Brand managers especially will find Attack of the Customers useful in identifying strategies for dealing with the four phases of an attack, the eight steps that the authors recommend for preparing a policy and strategy for attacks, and how brand loyalty (or disloyalty) play a major role in both reach and amplification of customer attacks."
"These are so cute and arrived on time! Even earlier ! Only downside is that the one size fits all is not true. I'm pretty short and the cats face sits below my knees. Still so cute"

Why wasn't this CD wrapped as all new CD,s are?"

"Nice size,,,,easy use....clean shave....needs foil replacements....how to order them???.Good price for the product.  Like the pop-up trimmer....seems to be easy on batteries...."
"Well, so far I think the ring is great. I 'm a mechanic and it proves to be a very durable wedding band. So I would give it a 4.5 star rating. The only thing it lacks is a little more eye appeal."

"With the iPhone 4 you can not just replace a digitizer, you also need a LCD screen that you cannot take off your old digitizer. This is pointless to buy and people shouldn't sell just this part."

"This book was very intense and exciting. I couldn't put it down. I just wish the ending was better. It's not clear enough for me."
"I spent years at the beach when I was younger and using sunscreen was uncool.  Well, my skin suffered for it.  Using this product has already taken years off my complexion in just days!  I can't wait to see what it does after I use it for weeks!  And you need so little for it to help.  A few drops is all you need to rub into your skin and watch the years melt away!  Thank you, Natural Beauty!"
"It was great would be better if alex was more like in the first or second book. Would read it qgain"
"Poetic acceleration was a great surprise for me. Although my normal reading habits don't usually include books from this genre, i enjoyed the perspective the author has shared with me.  I am always interested in being challenged to understand the eternal perception of others in the world and i feel this book has expanded mine. Thank you"

"I really like it and it has been very useful. It is exactly what I expected. I really use it all the time."
"This Mid-bass is simply awesome! It can handle enormous amounts of power for such a small speaker, and a mid bass at that. It has no problem handling highs and putting out a little thump. Even if this speaker is used for just a general component speaker it would perform amazing. no complaints."
"Like 'Cars' it is funny and light heartted.  Good for the Kids.  I like flying myself and can identify with some of what is happening."

"This is my favorite song EVER! I've bought other music, but this is the best one. Amazon is the best place to buy music because you can buy it and load it to iTunes.  It's awesome."
"Liked the way the story developed. Good to see the nerd get the pretty girl. Show that you should not judge people at first sight"
"Coming from the restaurant world, where most dishes have a tendency to be a little ""complex"" and lack nutritional balance, these recipes were like a breath of fresh air. Super simple but fun to prepare(with or without the kids). A must have for anybody that's on the run but striving to live a healthier lifestyle.--Chef Chauncey"
"Easy read and pulls back the veil on corruption in our campaigns and elections. Shockingly informative! A real who's who in the high finance of political finance."
"Great quality! Applies so gently and smooth :) I had to apply two coats for the black to be pigmented!"
"So perfect! My cell is well protected and the quality is amazing. Not to mention the case is adorable! Loved it!"
"I ordered this product thinking it would come with the connection cord (silly me). But no, it comes individually! So don't expect to actually be able to USE this product upon arrival, my fellow Amazon shoppers! Because you can't. There's no cord. There's no installation CD. You'll have to order those seperately. I would comment on how well the actual product is, but I couldn't plug it into my computer so I have no idea.Had to return this item and recieved full refund, which I am thankful for.But the seller does not inform the buyer like he/she should."
"I wear a size 0g and I absolutely love these! They are perfectly flared on each end so that it doesn't slip out and they aren't impossible to get in. The amethyst design is beautiful and very good quality. I highly recommend these plugs; very unique."
"I love this style, but ended up having to return it because the hole in the middle was very tiny. I wear size 0g, but it still was not as big as the holes usually are. I just didn't like the look of the hole. I recommend buying this one when your gauges are a little bigger than just 0g; it makes your plugs look tiny."
"I have ordered about five of these exact keychains because they keep breaking. They aren't the best quality keychains, however, they don't cost very much. So if you're looking for quality, this isn't the keychain for you. However, if you're looking for temporary style, this is the place to find it!"
"My grandson loves this truck he hasn't stopped playing with it.i recommend this truck it's definitely worth it a great buy"

"This case fits a little snug. But is really worth the buy. My daughter loves it. And it arrived very quickly. Very pleased."
"This flag is missing a star...I didn't notice it for a day or so when I first took it out. Now that I have noticed it, I don't see anything else. I guess I shouldn't expect much more for 5 bucks"
"I love these things such a nice bass, the music sounds smoothly just everything about it is cool :) highly recommended"
"This book is adorable. I love the story and the artwork is so awesome. I have bought 6 books to give to my grandchildren and my nieces and nephews children and I am buying more to give to their grandchildren. This book is a perfect story for all ages including grandparents. You'll love this book and so will your children and grandchildren."
"I feel like I was duped.  Fill a childs plastic trick or treating pail with water and that is exactly how cheap this is.  Smoking caldron?  It doesn't smoke outside of thr cauldron itself.  It is worth no more than thirty dollars.  I went by previous review s.  I am so disappointed."
"This game is much more challenging than it appears to be at first. I love the use of tools to help get players from one level to another. The &amp;#34;out-of-the-box&amp;#34; thinking that is required is enjoyable and challenging. However, only one hint is provided at each level, and it is not always helpful. Since there is no other strategy guide, going online for help is a nuisance. It is also frustrating to have to begin each level from the start when you  repeatedly get burned or eaten, etc."
"This game is one of the most annoying games I've ever played. I like these types of games, but the correct puzzle solutions either have to be executed repeatedly before they work, or the tools do not move into their correct places. Had I known this game was so riddled with technical problems I would not have purchased it. Execution needs much work.  A hint guide would be a plus as well. Very disappointing."
"I use to drink just the regular flavor but this new flavor its good , I will recommend it. to anybody:-)"
"When I saw the urn on the site I had my doubts about how it would look upon receipt, however my family and I were pleasantly surprised. It is a beautiful piece and one we are proud to use to contain our Mother's remains."
"I bought this for my mother so she could take her cat outside for walks. It took a week or so and some bribery with treats inside it to get her Burmese in it. Now weather permitting they go for walks everyday. It is sturdy enough to lean on like a cart which helps my mother be able to walk longer distance. The quality of the stroller is everything the reviews I read described."
"Already showing signs of wear and I have only had it a week. The edges are already chipping off as well."
"My protective case arrived in perfect condition and the quality was as expected, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, I love it!!"
"this product is good i heard about it, from other womans, After I did my research when I had my miscarriage and I have pcos but, my doctor won't give me anything because they feel as if I got pregnant I'm fine. But once I bought this cream and can say my night sweats have gone and I stop it and notice it came back so yes it does work and I will contuie to buy this product...."
"the only reason I'm giving it less stars than it deserves is because of the writing errors. there wasn't a lot but there was definitely enough for you to notice. But... this series is still amazing. I didn't want to put them down. I would definitely recommend these books."
"First thing that stood out was that the seller was fast to respond to questions and gave clear and concise answers. Very professional, nice to talk to.Having previously purchased a watch from Amazon, the second thing that stood out was the packaging. The watch box was packaged securely and presented no chance to damage from the shipping process.Then there's the watch itself which is absolutely stunning. Personally I'm not going to wear it every day because everything about it commands for a special occasion.Overall the watch arrived fast and I'm fully satisfied with the purchase. If you are thinking about buying it I would recommend that you do so now because it sells out fast and I've made the mistake of waiting the first time I saw it and had to wait for a while before it was back in stock again."
"I love this product. Perfect for any Crossfit WOD or any cardio workout.  Product is durable, and most importantly the customer service is top notch!"
"This is very good deal and very attractive. its not cheap at all. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS TOP"
"Movie had a good performance. But the last 20 minutes of the movie could not be seen since it was freezing constantly. I bought it as used in very good condition."
"The story was cute, semi-predictable.  The low rating is due to the ending. I honestly didn't see it coming, not in the twist of a story kind of way but that it just ended.  I felt like the ending came out of nowhere. I actually went back a page to make sure I didn't somehow skip to the end or something."
"Is there a second one if not there should be. You can't end a book about love and list and never find out if they end up together or not."
"This is definitely the best horoscope app it's so great it tells my day almost perfectly and it gives the best advice"
"One the best games available very addictive and fun. Surpasses most all of the others by a long shot. Plus it's free!!"
"Anyone who enjoys delving into the possibilities of the physical and spiritual will surely enjoy this as much as I did! It kept me coming back for more and hating to put it down when I had to. The author did a great job of describing this fantasy world and the nature of the demons who can get hold of our own world, using deceit to make us into whatever they want. Cant wait to see what happens in the next book and if our heroine can defeat what evil has taken hold of her!"
"I use this frequently, mixing it with other oils to soften the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on my face and limbs. It gives the finer oils some body and stays shimmering on the surface allowing the others soak slowly in. Great with grape seed oil on arms and legs right after showering."
"I love my new carrying case.  I have recieved so many compliments on it. Working in an office environment, I orderd the black.  If I knew how much I was going to like it, I would have orderd more in various colors for outside the work place.  The price was excellent also!"
"Oh my goodness this is an awesome product! I have never used it before but I ordered it and was not disappointed! It was awesome! Compliments the perfume so well! Will order more in the future! :)"
"This was a much wanted item for my husband as he LOVES to grill year-round! :) The price was awesome and he loved it!"
"It was all bent out of shape it works but not that well... Wow word requriments really im not too happy"
"IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE MINECRAFT PE FOR ANY TABLET OR PHONE GET THIS. YOU CAN ADD ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT INTO YOUR INVENTORY IN SURVIVAL . NOW I DONT HAVE TO GO MINING ANYMORE I ALREADY HAVE 255 DIAMONDS"

"This is really good for an app that was not made by mojang officially I used Honeydews skin and it worked perfectly the only downfall is that; honeydew maybe the only skin I have yet to find any others overall its good XD"
"this game is one of the very best games ive played. the pictures cant descripe the real graphics in the game.  my only wish is that they made all the zombies normal and not like left for dead where there are different kinds.some of the new zombies look pretty disgusting lol"
"DO NOT BUY!!!!!! From the get go the unit was horrible. The exhaust fan hose fell out of the window housing, the unit filled with water within one day, leaked all over the hardwood floors and warped them. And the unit has a light that is supposed to warn you when the unit is full of water, did not come on. The air blows sideways out of the unit with no way to fix it. It now constantly drips water even when it is not turned on. I also heard they do not make replacement parts for this unit anymore. STAY AWAY!!!!"
"The cas&amp;eacute; is great for me because not only is it durable but it looks good to. People often ask if I have an iPhone.... It makes me laugh a bit. But the case is beautiful and well made. I love it. And i got fast from amazon in just 3 days. I would order again from amazon.com"
"My 3 year old daughter loves this book! We borrowed it from our library, but she did not want to return it! I had to buy her a copy for herself, since she enjoys reading and she LOVES the CARS movies. Before the book came in the mail,  I convinced her to let the borrowed one go by explaining how other children would not be able to enjoy the pleasure of reading the book if she kept it. The next day, hers showed up in the mail! Awesome"
"I was skeptical a out vulkano, and now I love it, I can stream my soccer games from my cell or computer. I am glad I bought it."
"Be careful when opening and closing the door.  If you accidentally shut it to hard batteries move around and turn off its electronic key pad function.  So make sure you keep the key in a safe place that isn't in the safe.  Overall for what you spend it is a wonderful safe."
"I was more than happy to receive a special travel package that included a tube of Euphoria lotion at no extra cost!"
"Formal dress at a decent price, nothing exciting about it - VERY lightweight. Would be great for an outdoor summer wedding. I am tall so it was a little shorter than I had hoped but for the price you can't be too picky. The color was DEAD on and exactly the shade I needed. In the picture it looks more fitted around the middle than it was, but overall, a nice dress and again, can't complain about the price. It arrived in a soft bag like package, not a box - dress was folded in a loose clear plastic bag inside."
"I love this case. Bolkin is a fantastic place to deal with. They ship quickly and with such class. I would recommend them to all my friends."
"I wasn't sure if I would liked this item at the time of ordering it. However, when I received it and installed it, It was a perfect match.I recommend it."
"I got my item about a month ago. I was able to inflate all the balls that my kids had. This item got the job done."
"This item broke in 1 day. I didn't bother returning. I hate to give 1 star feedbacks. But I would not recommend this product."
"The bulbs are actually very good. I am happy to have chosen these bulbs. At first I thought that ther ewas a problem with the bulbs because they were dim. Howver, I fixed them and they are really nice."
"I love bright lights. I have a light fixture that it can only hold 1 light bulb. I needed more light. This was the perfect item I was looking for."
"If you are looking for a deep strategy game, look somewhere else. But if you want a simple to learn and fun to play game, then this dice game is worth the price.In Zooloretto Dice Game you are responsible for populating your zoo with various animals. These animals show up on the special dice you get with the game. The rules are simple. Roll the dice and then decide which dice go onto which trucks. Then, select which truck delivers animals to your zoo. Score points for animals you bring in, or tickets you sell, but don't overpopulate your zoo. That can lead to losing points.My 7 year old daughter loves this game. It's an excellent way to teach children a bit of strategy and planning."
"When I received this cross  the first thing I noticed was the detail, it is beautiful! The size and weight are perfect. One of the reviews I read noted that the back of the cross was &amp;#34;hollow&amp;#34;, I would say it was designed that way so the cross would not be to heavy and it would not be able to be showcased on the delicate yet sturdy chain that it came on. The cross is a nice solid piece...I love it!!"
"I expected to get what I paid for but, I got So much more, this skirt, as well as the two other items I ordered, were very generous in the sizing and I was truly amazed by the quality! One of the items I ordered, I didn't know how to enter the size but, I got an email early the next morning asking what size I needed and my order was shipped and received prior to the estimated delivery Amazon gave me...Thank you all, I am a 47 year old Mom of 3 (almost grown) girls, who's getting her sexy back and your site is now on my short list of must visits!!!"
"it took some tries but the old hard drive was eventually seen by the system, no fault of the C2G unit."
"I love Subway surfers! It's graphics could be improved though. And make the items (characters, boosts,etc.) a bit cheaper too. All in all, it's a pretty good game."
"I was very impressed by the results, K&amp;N has manufactured a product that will not only save me money in fuel but also in replacement cost for air filters."
"This is a great study tool to test your knowledge for the PHR certification exam. It asks questions in a similar format of the actual exam. It helped me passed the test."
"I used this piece to change out an old 40+ year old blank toggle cover. They do not sell this type of cover any more with the screws in the normal place of the toggle cover screws. It was easy to put in except the holes where the screws would go for the new toggle cover were not pre drilled. I had to screw the screws in the make room and the toggle cover doesn't fit as snuggly as a I like. The room looks better especially with matching toggle and outlet covers."
"The bra is pretty but it offers little support due to the elastic shoulder straps. The cut of the bra does not give full coverage which causes a potential spill over effect."
"I love these furniture legs. I ordered the 7&amp;#34; legs twice and the 8&amp;#34; once. I bought this set for a new couch I bought for my father (elderly gentlemen with knee problems) I gave him my 8&amp;#34; legs instead. He did not get a chance to enjoy the furniture legs, but my second mom now has the furniture in her house and she loves the extra height from the furniture legs. She's an overweight senior citizen with health and joint problems. It is much easier for her now to sit down and stand up from the furniture.  I have the furniture legs on my sofa in the living room and den as well as on the love set in my living room. All of my friends and family love the extra height of my furniture. (Of course, they're all big, tall or both usually both.). The only problem with the legs is to make sure the current furniture has the opening to screw the the legs in."
"I ordered the download card when I first purchased a Leap Pad 2 for my son. The card was easy to use but you usually do not get as much savings using the download cards as opposed to downloading the apps from the Leap Frog site directly. Once you set up the tablets, you'll receive emails with discount codes. I wait to get a discount on the apps before I buy them. You can save 15% - 30%+ waiting for a sale that normally occurs at least once a month."
"I bought this after my four year old broke this piece. I tried super glueing the piece back together, but it would break at the joint every time he pulled on the piece and not the door. It was a good fit. It seemed a little expensive for a plastic replacement part but it got the job done."
"I'm glad that I read the reviews and ordered the recharger pack. My son constantly used his LeapPad 2 (until he got the LeapPad Ultra for Christmas) almost daily for hours on end.  It's worth the upfront cost. I'm sure I would have used countless numbers of batteries without it."
"Interesting read.  An unusual fairytale, but still somewhat believable and very enjoyable.  Beyond Cinderella with twist and unseen turns everywhere."
"A great read!  Once you start this book, you cannot put it down.  David's strength is developing his characters into real life people whom you can actually visualize and understand. You'll have your favorite character - I have mine.  You can see the countryside, the small town, the river, the people and you can smell the smells, taste the food and get into the very thick of the plot."
"This was a good book, definitely worth reading. I just wish the author hadn't switched so much between the past a present, made things a little confusing but once you get past that it has a good plot and character substance."
"I like this story because it wasn't just your run of the mill plot line, the author keeps you guessing and entertained. Plus there are definitely some really HOTT scenes in this one. Recommend!"
"The book story line was good but the ending was cut way too short. It doesn't even seem to be a set up for a sequel. I just prefer to have more to the story."
"E ottimo,il mio figlio di 3 anni e contentissimo,lo racomando a tutti i genitori ,perche il tempo di stare insieme con i suoi bambini passa piu divertente."
"I love it! I looked everywhere for this exact helmet, and I finally found it. It is awesome. I will never need another helmet."
"This is my first tablet and it does not disappoint. Very smooth and quite fast. No stuttering except for a few apps I downloaded.Like the screen; sharp and bright except in bright daylight, but that's no surprise as this is the case with all tablets."
"Miss Arrington's sophomore book shows maturity in writing yet retains the whimsical musing in style and cadence that made her first novel so attractive. Her technical knowledge shows she's done her homework and gives a Tom Clancyness feel to educate the reader and engross them in the details to be part of the action.Her play on words and tongue in cheek references counters the seriousness of the subject matter and action sequences that slingshots the reader through the hurricane ride that is Awesome.The story follows Riley on a case that is to be the perfect storm of events coming together where she is always calm as the eye, on the exterior. She has to tackle personal and professional entanglements of murder, high theft and techie wit all while in heels.Her reputation has chosen her to be co-counsel on what seems to be a standard case for a high profile businessman. Sam Stone wants Riley on his case with him for her brains, body and a chance to break her personal armor. They change their strategy with the case as a hurricane is bearing down on them and they deal with the whirlwinds of events that gives a gratifying end to their cause. Arrington's ease into the subjects and expertise disguises the unexpected turns in the story. She draws on her strength of good character formation with some side characters that deserve books of their own. The storm passes with a satisfactory rush of action to conclude the book while hinting to another storm brewing.I certainly hope to get even more from Riley as Miss Arrington continues her journey. This will be worth waiting for."
"I bought this desk for my son.  He put it together and loves it.  The hardware and instructions were easy to use and follow.The only drawback is the weight of the piece once finished typical of particle board furniture. My son stresses that the hardware was excellent and quality."
"I have special issues so for me it's just ok.  With an orthodic insert it is working better.  The shoe has a flat sole (bottom) which is not good for my walking issue."
"This Jambu is one of the best shoes I've worn from this company.  Very comfortable, breathes well, but still feels substantial as a supportive shoe.  The fit is great."
"This shoe its and looks great.  Great for a little more dressed up look and very comfortable because I can't wear hi-heels."
"Fits great and gives great support for someone with foot issues. Colors are muted so take that into consideration Good shoe"
"Very comfortable, and good for those really hot days because it's a very strappy sandal but with good support. This sandal compares to the Teva with the same strap design only this is a little more dress up not just for outdoor recreation."
"every thing i ordered i like every much ,only the bag maybe is PU leather smell so bad, and the bag top handle seem very easy loose."
"It kept me watching, decent action adventure, not many &amp;#34;bad words&amp;#34;.Would recomend for ages 13 and up.I like the special efects, and of course ewan macgregor is one of my favorite british actors!"
"A story of losing a loved one is always heartbraking, specially a child. I have seen losing a loved one from a parents perpective, but this first time a see it with a hurting older sibling.Zac Efron did a wonderfull job, I will recomend this movie for ages 13 and up."
"It keep me interested, the story is plausible due to online dating, action is good. Will recomend to ages 12 and up."
"This book talks about a half-blood (a child of a God and a mortal) Percy Jackson's adventures. I thought this was a great book! I now know a bunch of Greek Gods I diddn't know about.P.S. sorry for any spelling (if there are any)"
"This product was great easy to put in and take out .plus I could wash my hair with it in and it lasted along time in my hair 4 months it was well worth the money."
"I was very excited about this planter. I got this planter to give as a Christmas present due to the fact that my mother has 4 pugs. When I received the huge box I was very excited only to find out that there was a much smaller box. That box had the pug planter in it. Disappointed I paid that price for that small of a planter. I do love the fact that is resembles a pug very well since how a lot things dont. I am overall happy with the product. I only wish that I knew it wwas going to be that small."

"I have owned one of these before and really liked it. My previous one had fallen in toilet and got ruined. Great sound quality. I can hear callers perfectly and they can hear me. I love that I can hear the callers # thru my headset and voice call by the push of a button. only wish it would say my contacts name but it doesn't do it for android 2.3 or higher. Other than that it's great/"
"good description of item and on time arrival, would recommend this item to others. now i'm just filling space to satisfy the word req."
"Got my new cord charger in the mail today and love it . It's long and charges as soon as I plug it to my phone!"
"A little flimsy at the bottom where I plug in the charger, other than that it's cute!"
"I love this mousepad, it's not very comfortable on my wrist.. but still looks awesome!"
"I received this necklace fairly quick, it's beautiful and looks exactly like the photos! Taking off 1 star because the material is quite itchy :x other than that, this is a beautiful piece!"
"I LOVE this bracelet, I received it promptly however I wore this for no more than 30 minutes and the lace detached from the bracket :( I had to stitch and super glue it back together. It was salvageable and for that I am grateful!"
"Looks exactly like the photos and the shipment was quick! :) Lovelovelove"
"One of my favorite wigs! It is very full and looks real! Truly a great wig for your money!"
"dissappointed....... fragrance does not linger for long eventhough it states that it is perfume!!.... Don't think that I would purchase it again!!"
"This item does not work and I cannot return it.  Do NOT buy this item!  Why are so many words required in the review when all is needed are: Do Not Buy This!"

"Works well to protect phone, but doesn't cover the face plate at all. Has good feel to it! Bright color you won't lose it!"
"Love the look of the product, it can be very bright, but I like that part as well. I did turn the brightness down to the middle setting.  I sleep to one sound all night and then I have the Chimes set for my alarm and I LOVE that you can have two different sounds.  When I 1st set the alarm, it sounded as if it was going to turn on with high volume, but it doesn't. The Chimes start off on a low volume then slowly get louder.  The radio comes in nice and clear as well.I am very Happy with this product, I have and will suggest it to others!"
"I cant really write much of a review because I ended up with not enough money to buy a mic, I'm currently using a webcam mic with a pop filter -_-On the bright side, I still can hear a difference. I think it's a good buy for anyone with a real microphone."

"I love crosswords andThats why I got it.would like some more books of similar kinds to work on."
"Part of the Davao won't stay on the wall. I like it, but disappointed it won't stay on the wall."
"I really love this book. It is sad and pulls at your heart easy. This book really caught my eye and I actually read it when i was pregnant. Now I'm against abortions and stuff like that but this book really touched touched me. I was so drawn into it I couldn't put it down."
"we gave this to my son for his first birthday, the big one, and he seems to really like it. he is learning  that if he hits the  hands it will make noise an  he LOVES music. he dances with it and likes to hit it a lot. I think it's great for little kids. it has been dropped on tile a few times an stomped on by a 4year old and it still works fine. we haven't tried the rolling feature yet though."
"I loved this bag! It looks really nice on the inside and has many pockets. now i have to say it is smaller than what i had though, actually a lot smaller. I was going to use it as a fashionable diaper bag but it was to small so now i have a new purse! It is super cute and im way happy with it-that was my old review from when I first got it. After I had it for a few weeks it started falling apart. The snaps came off and one handle totally broke off. It just kept falling apart so I stopped using it"
"I bought the conditioner and shampoo because on the bottle it says it works great on hair extensions. For me these did NOT do good for my extensions. I had real hair in and when I used these it dried them out and made them feel really terrible. it was really bad. lesson I learned, just because it says you can use extensions doesnt mean you can. If your looking for stuff more for extensions try Suave, its the best :)"
"He loves to play with this but one of the balls kept getting stuck so I threw it away. But other than that he loves it and dances to it."
"It took me three of them to get on but once I got it on I absolutely loved them!!!! It works great"
"Can I start by saying I LOVE these extensions. They are really cute!! I loved them so much I bought more sets of these and I do them in peoples hair at boutiques and events!! I have not had one single complaint about them at all. They work for all hair types, hair colors, and hair lengths. plus they are cute for all ages, not just teens. I have put them in toddler girls hair for pictures, teens hair, babys for pictures, even moms that just want a edgy young vibrant look (im one of them). I love these extensions and will ways be purchasing from these guys."
"This book is a great idea. I love the thought and work put into it but it feels more like a rough draft than an actual book to me. It was hard to keep up with when the characters came in. They were strangers an  then it skipped a ton and they were all friends. I wish he would of explained things a lot more instead of skipped around. I also wish I knew more about what happened when the aliens came and the experience they went through at that time. A great second book would be from the people's point of view that left earth with the aliens. This book has.  Lot of potential. It was worth the read."
"When I bought my kindle  I downloaded this free manual an  it helped me  learn things. Like I would of never figured out how to take screen shots an  stuff without  it"
"It is really good milk my baby like it a lot. No constipation at all only a lot of gas but other than that it is a pretty good milk."
"We love this product, great quality, good hard wearing plastic. Quality feel and realistic look. Good for play kitchens or shopping play. Super impressed."
"Good quality feel. Realistic food that can be used for a number of items such as kitchen play, shopping or feeding dolls. Hard warning toys that look to be designed for many years of play. Good to have both the lower case and upper case letters. Easy to clean."

"I liked this movie not sure why it got so many bad reviews i guess to each there own. I like twisted movies there creative different from the status quo, i guess you will love it or hate it"
"This book is actually two stories. L.E. Modessit's first major novel was ""The Fires of Paratime""; this contains that story and its later-written prequel. I've been looking for this book in print for a VERY long time, but now I have the Kindle version on my tablet AND my Android phone! This is a must-read for all sci-fi fans!!!!!!!"
"I dig piano music. Working an a coffee shop like I do, I get to hear a lot of it. This song popped up on our music system, and I just HAD to have it! So I did a quick online search, and lo and behold; the only place to find an uncorrupted copy was Amazon.com."
"I only download music I like, so of course I'm gonna give any song I have 5 stars. Wouldn't you?"
"I played the actual card game for a while and was hoping to reconstruct an old favorite deck to see how it would stand up in the ratings. However, this piece of crap app demands that you have a Facebook profile and that you &amp;quot;become a fan&amp;quot; to get more content (which I have discovered to be the card database).I don't have a Facebook account, nor do I want a Facebook account. If I could speak to the developer of this sh***y app, I'd tell him exactly what he can do with it.I'm very honest about my ratings; I don't say something is good when it isn't. Giving this app 1 star is actually giving it more than it's due. If you're reading this and have ANY common sense, take my advice: look somewhere else."
"I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to the apps I purchase, and this app was no different. However, it did function as promised and &amp;quot;immediately&amp;quot; coverted a song I had that I couldn't listen to to a format that my Android tablet understood. I just wish it could have been a stand-alone on-tablet app instead of an upload/download kind of thing."
"I use this app all the time on long bus trips. The puzzles can get to be a real challenge, but the artwork is exceptional and the ability to save the pictures to your SD card for use as wallpapers is a real bonus!"
"This is just the coolest little gadget!Very sleek and gets a lot of attention. I don't mind the attention since I love promoting products that I like. Helping me to lose weight and doubles as a watch (which is great so I don't have to pull my phone out to check the time when I am exercising). If I want to hide it, there is a magnetic feature where I can put it a non-obvious place. Im excited to have a product that helps me understand my sleep and activity levels. I love the topaz color and it looks great with the tan/leather watch band that I also purchased. Overall its very versatile and a great product. Would definitely recommend for someone who is trying to get back into shape or concerned with their health. Another thing I was really pleased with is that the customer support got back to me on a sunday night! (just had some questions)"
"Love this tube. It is good for starters and the ribbing is perfect, not too intense but not too light either. Great to get started with. Cleans easily and smells good. Highly recommended toy for personal fun."
"Started using it and started losing it, the pounds that is! Easy clean up and easy to use! Must have!"
"Follow up after the interview is an important tool to have the information is need to know and a recommendation!"
"The water itself is nice and comes out in a nice mist on the face. Good for setting make-up. However, for me, the bottle broke when I was about 1/4 of the way through using it, so now it is basically useless with a lot of wasted product. Perhaps the smaller bottles would work better (I have the 300mL/10.5 oz)."
"this is a must read for everyone who desire to start their day right. it's simple and easy to understand and ministers to every area of your life."
"this game was one of the stupidist game that was ever made and i regret ever buying it and wish i could return it"
"This is the funnest memory game I have ever seen.  The fun twist is t hat you get to see a preview of the game board before the timer starts and the pictures are hidden. You have to go really fast to beat the clock.I need to find non sexy version this game to share with my kids, etc."
"Not only &amp;#34;Barilla&amp;#34; is a premium brand for italian products, also this flour is the one you need to use if you are preparing Italina recipes (or pizza)."
"While I'm not a computer junkie take my review with a grain of salt, it does the job and has some nice features like the Guru that comes with the CD, haven't messed with it since I don't know a whole lot about it, but so far it runs  games amazingly."
"Moringa leaf capsules , I have been take them for 1 month and haven't seen any be difference in them so far,will continue to take see if gets better  performance ."
"Although used, the price was right! said what the battery was like and it charged up as new! it met my expectatons."
"This could have been spectacular but there is no-one narrating through the entire 1 1/2 hrs.Therefore, we don't know what we're seeing in alot of cases.Especially hotels.How are we supposed to do research and stay there if we're not given information? Don't bother renting....specials on TV are better."
"Between the young girl in this and Naomi Judds bad acting I couldn't watch more than a 1/2 hr. Andy Griffith did ok. Really bad and totally predictable."
"I grew up listening to this band.The cd has way too many songs I heard of and they all sound the same."
"I love unsulphered apricots.I have never found any better than the Trader Joes brand.I thought I'd try these and I hate everything about them.From flavor, thickness, not chewy enough........... Don't bother with these."
"One of the best CDs I've ever bought, just a pity I won't be seeing them playing live in Australia anytime soon!"
"Like most people as they age, I have marionette lines around the mouth and nose area.  I have chosen not to use fillers or to have surgery so am always looking for products that will enhance my almost 71 years old skin.  This product is excellent!  It has greatly diminished the lines around my mouth and actually lifted and minimized those around my nose area.  It is expensive but well worth the price.  I'm on my third bottle now and, on my skin, it is nothing short of miraculous."
"I absolutely loved this when I put it on my phone. It was very neat. Looked very nice. Came in handy having a mirror. I live in tn and it was still winter when I got it. However I just got back from sunny florida  and while there I had to take it off my phone because in the bright sun I could not see my phone when on like when in tn. Hope they come up with one that works as well in bright sun."
"I love it! I want it in blue as well! Very colorful and stylish! I want it in blue too"
"I was always disappointed with the short cord that came with my phone.  I never realized the longer cords were out there.  This one matches the gel cover on my phone perfectly!  And - I can actually put the phone on the table while it charges, instead of under it! :)"
"This air filter replacement was extremely difficult to find. The advertisement said this replacment filter would fit our OAC150RF and it didn't. We had to take if out of the box, cut it to fit."
"I must confess every time Lothaire was mentioned in previous books i would wait desperately to see what becomes of him, for some reason always had a feeling he was much more than his brooding arrogant persona. And boy was I satisfied, could't have asked for a better story. This had much more depth than I had anticipated. KC has done a great job with this badass vampire king who had no feeling of what so ever until he met his bride. I can't wait for the Nix to find her calling. The friendship between Nix and lothaire was always so touching and tender, loved their confrontation. So far my second favorite book after Demon from the dark. Go for this book if you want a resistant bride unwilling to be a bound by the most evil and powerful vampire in the Lore."
"I had my reservations to how this book would have been having read so many 50 shades type of books.this book took me by surprise and was instantly new in its writing as well its plot growing just juicer with plots and hidden mysteries with every turn of page.In short would love to see how this series would take its turn as the story unfolds.Well written Anna Zaires."
"Loved this book to the core. Maclaine is amazing  as a true demon/vampire and carrow's characterization is beyond expectation.The little Ruby has added to this book the much needed family love and tenderness. I couldn't put down this book. The ending was truly magnificent it had the punch in the right direction. All the powerful Lore characters from all the books coming under one roof to take down the Order, simply brilliant. Loved every aspect of Maclaine, and Carrow's ferocity. My favorite by far.Great job KC."
"I was pleasantly astonished to find myself wanting to finish this book and also read the series. They do have the predictable story line but who doesn't want to end a book with a happily ever after.It has all the plus points of giving the reader exactly what they want to hear and feel.Making it worth a read. Melody Anne has definitely the kept me intrigued and wanting to finish the series!"
"Good read for pure pleasure of some good eroticaLoved the details written in this short book.Wished it could have carried a bit more."
"I found the book to be extremely entertaining.  There wasn't a moment that I found myself bored and wondering when we would get to the action.  I liked the heroine and the two love interests of hers are both very likable."
"A lot of fun and it is a nice game. And I like it and it is a great nice game."
"these do not work at all! the kids at my sons party were pretty bummed they couldn't make the whistles work.."
"red comes off all over you and anything it touches and anything you touch after you get red on you."
"I dont know if it is supposed to leak all over the place but i kinda of doubt it. writing with it is smooth but not only does ink come out at the point of the pen (the nib) but it comes out on the top of the silver part and then where the nib and black thing connects it leaks there to so when i try to write with it, it gets ink all over my fingers....and hopefully you write semi fast because the longer you hold the nib on the paper ink just pours out. it took me a while to write the review because i thought maybe that i was putting the ink in wrong or squeezing it to hard or something but i've even just put the ink in without squeezing it and the outcome is the same no matter what."
"fun! not much control of the car just go or stop.. but still tones of fun but the battery only last 8min so that is inconvenient cause u have to stop every 8min and recharge it."
"I will try to sell it on craigslist to someone who has the right size bottle, to try and get my money back.  They should advertise it as only fitting one exact size of five gallon bottle; they should give the measurements and say it will only fit those bottles."
"Good quality and workability in a  mix with other powders for health issues and promotion of improved activities of daily living."
"A 'must read' for anyone interested in Natural History and birds in particular. This superbly written book is a masterpiece that I would recommend to any one at all interested in nature. I found the writing gripping and it puts in the most readable form matters that are quite complex."
"A fantastic read. The book can be picked up and read at leisure. Fascinating facts and writings. The commentary at the start of each letter is very well written and gives in insight into the letter and puts what you read into context thereby making it even more fascinating."
"I bought three of these and we absolutely love them they fit our devices perfectly and they are very well made the shipping was fast and very well packaged would definitely reccomend and buy from again thanks"
"I always choose this brand when shooting with disposables. Great deal and awesome lo-fi vintage photos. Buy these bad boys!"
"I loved the price and I love the grinder even more. This bad boy has it all and is super cheap. Buy it!!"
"These clip in so smoothly and fit comfortably. They have an awesome ratcheting strap that keeps you in your shoes tight. The grip on the sole is terrific when you have to get off the bike and climb up a muddy hill or something. I would definitely recommend these to a fellow cyclist. Good deal and great performance."
"This has helped my 1st grader when his class fiirst started with addition.  It has also encouraged my 4 year old to begin learning also. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for extra help with classwork, and who has an eager-to learn preschooler who wants to get ahead."
"International trip, still in perfect condition.Price was fantastic for such pretty luggage.Would recommend to anyone wanting great luggage."

"The chess game is a lot of fun cuz you get to actually play against your friends and family members it's so cool"
"This is a fun free app (although there is a paid version). It's not awe inspiring, does exactly what it promises. Recommended!"
"Its one of the best work of late Hans Zimmer. It was quite evident that he had the artistic independence to not to stick to any particular theme. I haven't liked an entire OST album since Bourne Supremacy. And &amp;#34;Into the Red&amp;#34; is right up there with &amp;#34;Bim Bam Smash&amp;#34;."
"A puzzle game meant for your tablet. There's a lot of puzzles to solve and lots of rewards and collectibles. If you're even a little bit patient and persistent, you can go a long way without spending any real money."
"This simple product should not cost more than 5$.I personally don't use it because the carrying case is good enough for my needs, and it's for sure better designed."
"I received this fast, and was delighted to have these DVDs.  My children watched these videos on VHS 20 years ago, and I had been looking for quite some time to get another copy for my great nieces and nephews and to use for my grandchildren (someday)"
"I got this for one reason, I own a car with leather seats in Arizona, bad business. I just wanted this to make my seats not hot and it does just that. My only complaint is sometimes it itches the back of my legs, but ohter than that its good!"
"Great nice. awesome sound. I reaaly enjoy the sound. I enjoy my music more. thank you very much. good bye"
"Protects well on my phone. the fit is exact and perfect. also is very stylish, i get a lot of omments on it"

"Makes sweet things taste so much sweeter and better! Made strawberries bought in winter taste like summer strawberries, what more can you ask for?"
"This is by far the best 7"" tablet /e reader I have owned or used. It does so much and moves so fast and smooth it is a true pleasure to use. The screen is incredibly clear. The e reader is much easier to see than other tablet/readers. The text to speech function is a real plus.It is so nice when you have to set it down and it reads to you while you do other things around the house. I love that I can cook, do dishes, fold laundry etc, and still enjoy my book! As far as I know this is the only tablet that has this function and in this price range you can absolutely do no better. There are some tablets that are selling for considerably more and do not do as much or work as well as the Kindle fire. Save your money and jump on this tablet. You won't be sorry."
"It was a good story, many women are living lives like this, sad but true...I recommend it, it held my attention"
"Since this isn't the first book in the series that I've read, I'm really disappointed that I'm reading them out of order!  I'm going to forge ahead and hope the next one and the last can equal the 3rd, which was amazing."
"This wonderful cast of characters brave separation, interfering relatives, ex-boyfriends /ex-girlfriends and Cadillac wielding senior citizens to bring about a story that will warm your heart!"
"The characters in this novel pull at your heart strings and you want so badly for a happy ending.  Looking forward to reading more by Amy Lane!"
"The two men in this story epitomize love as it should be.  It is sad how religion can be the source of so much pain."
"I just started reading this, but had to say that I loved the Boy Scout scene with the flipped canoe!Now that I've finished, I can still smile about the canoe, even though the need to shed tears is a more compelling expression of the emotions brought about by Mr. Benjamin's story.  The love shared by the men, and most of the women, transcended time, changes in relationships  and family division.  The author's description of the advent of the AIDS epidemic will definitely lead me to research it further.  Thank you!"
"I will be forever astounded at how we as supposedly 'thinking beings' can inflict such pain on each other.  I'm looking forward to reading the first of the books in the Coming Out series."
"Devin was holding out for Michael to turn gay, so accepting love from someone else was difficult.  Especially since his parents had convinced him he didn't deserve it.  Luckily their were others willing to convince him otherwise."

"This is a great story where characters grow and change.  Relationships begin, end and reform, as life affects the participants in a myriad of ways."
"The plot was excellent.  The main characters admirable, loving, sexy hot, kind and true to their passion and love for each other.  All of the minor characters were 'fleshed out' so you knew their motives and they felt like important parts if the story.  An excellent book!  Thank you Kindle!"
"After a rough beginning Alex and Shane have a chance at real happiness, and a built in family.  It was fleshing that Shane's mom stood by him."
"Angst never looked so sweet!  Throwing Kody in with his innocent comments and reactions ups the sensitivity level!  I'd love to know Cal's background."
"I love stories where the characters grow and change.  Where they get closer as the story progresses.  I love all the possibilities that were available to these men and how they chose each other in the end."
"I like a story with more of a connection between the characters.  Perhaps as the series continues I'd feel more by in."
"I loved the story but now need to read the prequel and the next book!  I'm like Jude, I want to know more about their future relationship and whether or not Michael will salvage his relationship with his mom."
"My first encounter with the work of Alexandra Cameron.  I'm definitely looking forward to reading a longer piece where she can really develop her characters and plot.  This was great!"

"The colors are way better than anything I found in the stores.  Go up a half a size for comfort because they are a tight fitting shoe."
"In the description it ses arc grips they are not good for atvs only dirtbikes and twist throttle they are mx grips they had me fooled thinking they are atv grips and I got them and the one side is for a twist throttle and they want me to pay the shipping cost and restocking fee to return them witch is five dollars less the the grips cost very unsatisfied and grips are no good for mud"

"Excellent product plus fast delivery, no one could beat that? Hope this eye pencil be available always, and the seller made it possible for me to get this eye pencil as fast as I needed it"

"I have been looking for years for an artificial calla lily comparable to the fresh Picaso calla.  I finally found it!"
"I have been very impressed with this book.  People that come over to my place eventually pick it up and start reading it.  The pictures, the way it is written, and the information it contains is alluring. You find yourself wanting to read more.  Well worth getting."
"I will start by saying that I have never replaced a garbage disposal before.  I was very unsure of what I was getting myself into.  I just knew that the 1/2hp Badger that was installed now had to go.  It was a 3 bolt style and I was looking at getting this and an adapter.  After reading some reviews, somebody had stated that everything that you need to install the Waste King L-2600 was in the box.  So I ordered the Waste King and some plumbers putty for good measure.  It arrived in 2 days in perfect condition.  I opened the box and looked at the contents.  I was instantly over whelmed.  I read the manual and realized that this was much easier than it looked.  I turned off the breaker for the disposal and started to remove it.  I disconnected the wiring from it and removed the pipe then turned it.  It came right out.  I removed an inner flange then pushed, the 3 bolt bracket was out.  I Cleaned up the sink, connected the E-Z connect flange for the Waste King, lifted the Waste King up and spun, it was in!!  I connected the drain pipe (had to cut an inch off it) easily.  Then I noticed the Waste King has a plug in power cord where as the old Badger was wired directly.  I went to Home Depot and got an easy connect plug for the wire and I was done.  I run the water and had no leaks.  Turned on the power and was amazed at how quite it was.  The one thing to note is the rubber guard that stops stuff from falling into the disposal on accident, also stops food.  This takes a bit of getting use to.Pros: Very easy to install and has everything you need.  Quiet and strong.Cons: Was not prepared for the plug in wire. (I know that is not really a con but I had nothing else bad to say.)"
"I bought this and the disk was bad.  Had to get a refund and ended up getting the game via download.  I like it.  It is not GREAT but it is good.  Esp with the price drop."
"I heard a few songs by B.o.B. so I bought this.  I was a bit disappointed because there are really only 3 good tracks.  If I had it to do again, I would just buy those tracks."
"I installed this very easily.  It is quiet and just works.  When I am playing a game or converting a family DVD, the cooler keeps my processor nice and cool.  Well worth the money.  The hardest part nobody mentions, is the routing of the thick hoses.  I am glad I made this purchase and would do it again."
"I put off buying this for years.  I broke down and I have not regretted the decision. Installation was a little tricky with my full faced helmet due to a sun visor operator on the left side of my helmet.  I put this on the right which works out fine because I can do everything via voice commands.  They say there is a way to bang the units together to get them to connect to each other.  I have only gotten this to work once.  The web site stuff is pretty useless except for programming the headset.  This allows you to assign names (which it announces) and groups.  I do not think I will ever be able to ride without this again.  I absolutely love it and would buy it again."
"Once again, Skrillex comes out of the studio like a boss.  A mix of dub step and reggae that should never be played with the volume turned down."
"It use this for my X-T1 and two lenses, cleaning kit, batteries, charger, and still have room for any miscellaneous items that get handed to me while we are out.  It is a little on the big side for me but I like it.  The material is canvas and feels very well made.  The straps on the front are buttons.  The strap is nice and wide so it does not dig into your shoulder.  I am very happy with this bag."
"Please with the quality and price of the item.  Also fast in receiving the order.Will order again when requred."
"Simply written by persons with great practical experience, there is no direct substitute for those who lack scientific background.  My own family has used this text as a guide on the mission field.  Robert D. Patton, MD, former professor of internal medicine in Liberia, West Africa."
"Why does God permit suffering.  How does suffering change us to make us worthy of authority in heaven.  The author was facing such questions when he was returning to Romania, possibly facing jail and martydom.  Here is his incisive analysis to this vital question."
"I am teaching a course in Missionary Medicine.  This can be a helpful text as a supplement to the principle text being used.  The author provides a great deal of material in his website that is also of great interest.."
"Written in an exciting manner, Richardson takes you into the life of the Sawi and their thinking processes.  He is an exceptional writer.  Although I could not claim that redemptive analogies (God making a clear illustration of salvation within the culture) is true in EVERY society, while in Suriname for 26 years among the Bush Negro people, I did find one as well."
"This book, now a classic, gives God great glory for His work in Bruce Olson's life.  As a missionary, I certainly would not recommend many of the things that Bruce did in the beginning, bur his appreciation of the culture and the people has been wonderful and the Lord has worked greatly in the lives of the people.  Read with discernment and see God at work.Robert Patton, MDMissionary to Suriname"
"As typical of Henry Morris, the book gives much evidence for creationism and ties the evidence together with the Bible."
"This book focuses primarily on the logical assumptions of evolution rather than on the data.  As the author points out, often both evolutionists and creationists agree on the facts but not on the interpretation because of difference of worldviews.  This book is helpful in understanding basic issues confronting the evolutionist/creationist controversy.Robert Patton, MD"
"This book is extremely well written, well paced and easy to read without seeming &amp;#34;dumbed down.&amp;#34;  It reflects the author's skill as editor for Israel My Glory.  Inspiring demonstrating the providence of God."
"I appreciated the information on J.O. Fraser, and the background information of the Lisu.  But I particularly appreciated the emphasis on the prayer of faith as well as resistance to demonic oppression.  I used this in one of my classes on missions.Robert D. Patton, M.D."
"This book is a classic on persecution and suffering.  Foxe wrote it at the time of suffering and not 300 plus years later.  The same sort of suffering is being experienced by many Christians today."
"Reasonable price, comfortable, big enough to carry bills and passport, no problems with setting off alarms from metal.  You need to be aware that it will be picked up on a body scan, and I have had to remove it on airline trips."
"This is very well done as a missionary story.  If you are a missionary as I am, you will enjoy it.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the family in action - reminded me of my daughter and son-in-law in Suriname, South America, where they have a ministry involving their nine children.  It is not a drama, however, if that is what you want."
"I get one of these for my Dad each year. He is a trout fisherman but nothing like some eye candy in waders to make him think of taking me along with him to the mountains and do some fishing.This calendar has some really good photos of girls posing with fish. Nothing risque, just HOT!"
"It's great for really cleaning your hair squeaky clean but has a strong odor smell that affects my allergies. I don't understand why nature or natural claiming anything would put dyes or perfumes in their products."
"Best safety and sunglasses you do not have to worry about! Large 130mm  and slight silver reflective coating. The clarity is very good with these."
"This wood whistle sounds just like a train. My little nephew comes over and plays with one i had as a kid so we bought him one for christmas to play with. I think he'll like it. This is a four hole whistle design and really sounds like a train."
"Its a frame kit for pictures it works as designed. Probably could have come with some more smaller screws but overall OOK makes good hangers."
"Nice big metal birdhouse. Good construction. Has three sections so you can fill up to three different types of feed. Big enough to where other birds don't scare off smaller birds if one or another is on an opposing side. lol I hung this using a metal rod style pole that grips to deck or porch, if this feeder filled makes the rod droop you can always put in vice and bend it to the right height you need it to stay. This feeder also is great and comes with post option mounting. Only thing is i wish the top was a little bigger than bottom as to better keep rain off or make more shade."
"This works well if you cut the onion in half or quarters but will not work well with a whole veggie etc. It's plastic so i see this in the future breaking at some point when pushing down with force, but for now it works as advertised. Has two removable sized grids which I used by itself once on a potato.  Dishwasher safe! and comes with cleaning tool for top underside."
"I'm not a fan of the command stickless stuff as in the past i've had things fall off of variety of walls. This one works well in the bathroom, i use it as a towel holder to the shower tub surface and it holds very good."
"I am told it was a comfortable bra and straps fit nicely. For the price i've ordered more for her."
"These are ornate tough little wood toothpicks, i prefer these over the bamboo toothpicks. If the price is right this brand is ok and comes with plastic container."
"Very good story from the Roots on into Queen. I'm not really a fan of Halle Berry but she was great in this movie. Lots of good actors played in this movie. Highly recommend it."
"Have yet to find too many things that the Japanese don't make well. This thing does good at grinding coffee. Glass bottome and well built simple grinder."
"Tried this for psoriasis and will work sometimes but did not for me even when taking the pills. This is not to be confused with oregano you cook with! this stuff is already mixed with olive oil but is not too potent."
"Used this for christmas lights outside, works great and the reach is long ways. Good simple kit to use for up to 10amps"
"It is smaller than full size keyboard, keys are tiny in comparison but other than that it's a keyboard to use."
"Holds well against the heat, is somewhat on the thick side. This style pincher grab glove is like most, i wish they would make one that has fingers, that would be great. Good quaility stitching and overall materials used are good."
"It's good because it has oatmeal in it, and it has no smell which is plus! It does however leave my skin with a greasy sticky feeling that i don't care for, but it does help with my dry skin after showers and for general stuff. I do know oatmeal is a good natural moisturizer so it works. As far as Eczema, I would not know if it helps or not."
"Got for my elderly mom and she prefers wide version but over all the walking of shoe was nice she said and the sole was not slippery or wore uneven so far."
"It's ok up to about 180lbs, after that it becomes stiff against your end. For a heavy guy id look into memory foams or cushions with filler because this did not cut it for me. I'm using this until i can find another that works for me."
"Its pretty and all but seems kinda cheap metal or plastic on back, the necklace it comes with is really cheap plastic and should be replaced by a nice leather one. But still worth the price"
"I love this sticker and the text it contains! I get people asking about it all the time and telling me how much they love it! They all agree with it"
"Never was a fan of lana until the great gaxby soundtrack with beautiful, after that found this track and has a good beat and sound to it also."
"First: MADE IN THE U.S.A!!!!  Finally something NOT made in CHINA!This can opener does not fail at opening steel cans or other cans. I use this when the automatics choke up and cannot open cans. The big handle makes it easier to get a grip and rotate."
"I've used Sandisk for years, never seems to fail me. I got this brand because it was one of the cheaper prices ones for a 32gb at the time. Overall have had no problems with it. Reasonable transfer speeds."
"Keyboard works good for the price on Amazon. Three led light choices to choose from Blue, Red, and Purplish i think color. Large print is good for those who can't see characters well. Light function can be manually turned off above keypad by holding in the led light button."
"For the price and detail these are nicely done glass figurines. Made in China but still a really pretty piece."
"A catchy tune that brings back memories of long ago, where people expressed more and crazy dancing beautiful blondes where in videos like the safety dance."
"This stuff says limited edition but has been on the market for at least a year or more, which is great to me! This stuff smells good and doesn't seem to affect my allergies too bad. As with most oils that plug in i say it lasts for a month or two."
"This slot machine is really nice for the price. You manually pull lever and it spins, if you land on the right sequence money tokens will fall out! You can put real money in it if you want. It has a feature that when you put in the the money you can't access it unless you either win or hit the secret release. Overall a nice little gift for the person who never leaves vegas. lol"
"It's ok if you weigh about 70lbs else you will flatten it out in one sit. Not firm and not for heavy people."
"Why call this dermatologist or allergenic at all if it has perfume added. This stuff is nothing more than after shave for men! It doesn't even moisturize well, and the &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; part i wonder about."
"The quality of this ring is great for the price. Other jewelers ask $250 for almost the same thing and they claim it's on sale. My fiance works with cars and doesn't like anything too flashy, so this ring is absolutely perfect. It also arrived perfectly on time. Overall, great service."
"Will not charge with this case on it keeps plug from connecting good I like the case nice looking thanks"
"ITEM WORKED PERFECT! I PUT IT IN, I POWER UP AND I HAVE BEEN USING IT EVERY SINCE. I'M GLAD I ORDERED IT."
"THIS BOOK TELLS WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE AMERICAN DIET AND SHOWS HOW WE SHOULD BE CORRECTING IT.  I'M WORKING UP THE WILL POWER TO GIVE IT A TRY."
"This book was ordered for a client from another country who need to understand and use the English language better."
"This book was purchases for a client who was studying for her GED.  It allowed her to review the information ahead of time."
"I recommend this book to anyone who needs to understand difficult relationships with men.  Men have very fragile egos.  They can be damaged easily when they are children.  This translates into bad behavior in adult relationships.  As an executive director of a women's shelter I see the end results over and over.  I have ordered many copies for clients and advocates to read."
"This book is a very easy to read book.  There is really good information included between the front and back covers."
"I ordered this for my mother  She has used it for years.  She recommends it.  Her skin is very lovely."
"The shipper sent the mats out quickly.  I am pleased with them.  They have become very difficult to find in the stores."

"Love them.  This is the second pair like this that I have purchased.  The first pair held up well and these should too."
"This book was recommended by a family member who followed the plan to get back to good health.  Good Read"
"Great product to use with embossing powder.  It has added a new dimension to my scrapbooks.  good product. I love it."
"THIS IS MY SECOND SET.  OUR DAUGHTER GAVE THESE TO US FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR.  i HAVE ORDERED 2 MORE SETS AND WILL ORDER MORE FOR GIFTS."
"It looks identical to the photo. It's a fairly large stone. There are no issues with the prongs and the stone is not loose. Unfortunately I bought the wrong size for my finacee and they don't make it in a 5.5."
"i liked the necklace only flaw is the chain but there isn't really anything we can do about it for the money it costs. Any code geass fan should get one"
"I love diamond dash .! &amp;lt;3 But the only problem i have with it is that the app takes pretty much about 5 minutes to load ! And sometimes it won't even load and this app keeps freezing! This is an OUTRAGE ! But still a good app / game ! {-: ^O^&amp;lt;3"
"Buy it"
"Fits amazing looks amazing, got to me way faster then expected, I wear a large and ordered a large, but if your a between large and XL go XL."
"http://clashofclanshelper.com/ - I got free Clash of Clans gems here! Get yous too in less than two minutes!! THE ONLY WORKING GEMS GIVEAWAY!!"
"This shirt runs very small.  It not only fades slightly on first wash, even in cold water but shrinks slightly as well..I purchased this as a work shirt so ordered an XL to be slightly large. After the first wash it is more like a generously sized medium.  This was a major disappointment."
"this item is so flimsy it should be advertised as &amp;#34;made of aluminum foil&amp;#34;  I tried to use it for what is was designed and after the first &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; the handle broke.  Guess ya get what ya pay for.  Should have gone to Lowes!"
"Too small to use for much of anything.  Perhaps to use for pins when sewing but not for food or dining."
"much too big for what I was needing.  It is a fine pot for herbs but a bit too big to be indoors during the winter."
"This sunglasses are really amazing, they fit really good and are extremely comfortable. My face is kinda small and they look really good."
"excellent product for the price, great size, it has helped me a lot, and the magnet capability is great to have it over the computer."
"We bought this bag to carry the basic things during our last travel and it worked just fine. It has some handy pockets with easy access. great product and it look nice"
"My mother loves it!! It sums up everything that I would ever want to convey to my mother and the same goes for her"
"This cover is nice but it didn't fit the phone it says its for ( Galaxy S2].  Very disappointment I'm not Anker to show it off."
"Bought this case for my wife and we were thoroughly impressed with it!  I couldn't believe it would be such a solid case for the price.  Definitely worth every penny!"
"I have watched this series before and loved it but sadly missed the end so I decided to buy the series to catch up on old memories. It didn't disappoint a bit. It came quite in one pack and was delivered real fast in real good shape. For all that like a kind of mystery show with a entertaining story and a good character play then I would advise you to buy these series. I find it remarkable how Johnny uses his abilitys to help others. Will Johnny though be able to save the future of many people? If you want to know I would buy the series now :D. I know that was mean of me but hes worth it."
"This is one of my favorite series, it has all, creativity, excitement, its funny, it has something mysterious of how its going to end and it always keeps you guessing. It came in a great shape like the seller told of it. I got it pretty quick too. It was really worth every cent I put in.  I would advise this series to any science fiction movie lover and I think it even has a kind of criminal sight there too if you like crimes. Well I choose out of all these things to give 5 stars."
"so easy to be installed, and works really really great.I highly recommend it.I didn't use it for long time but it seems that high quality :)"
"This product is a good replacement for the original battery.I am very satisfied with the performance of this battery.Good buy."
"I am soo delighted with this electric broom.It has great power. I like the swivel head , not too noisy. The dirt cup could be a little bigger so I empty it every time I use it.No big deal.Nice long cord.Don't hesitate too buy.It's definitely worth the price.Thanks Hoover I was worried I would have to spend a fortune for something with quality. Great buy"
"After about a week it shorts out,this is the second one with the same problem.Do not waste your money or time."
"Nice product, love that they look so natural! Easy to put on and they last a long time.Great product, wouldn't use anything else"
"its great!!! i purchased it for my 12 yr old girls...cause i didn't want to get anything to expensive...but i would purchase it for myself...the only thing i suggest u do is go thru it to make sure there was nothing that  was downloaded that might be inappropriate for kids...it also fits gud in the case witht the keyboard attached...other than.that..the touch screen slides bk n forward easy...color on screen ..wonderful..IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT!!"
"tthis item was shipped in a timely manner..the 7""tablet a Zeepad fits great on the slots that holds the tablet...one thing to notice...is that...the lights don't come one at once...but after about 5 min they come on...it charges from the tablet...i purchased it for my 12 yr old girls..i am satisfied wit the purchase..."
"First, you were recommended by my best friend for 63 years so that was a good start.  I have received all of my security items and have found them to be sturdy, reliable, and perhaps most important, easy to install.  I had one glitch with my order that was taken care of the same day by a very nice young lady in customer service.  Online ordering of my system from a good choice of products was very easy.  I could track shipment via email that was sent to me and the package arrived in good shape on time.  Not a single item was damaged.  Instructions to set up system are outstandingly easy.  I have already recommended it to several of my other friends."
"This is the best wallet/phone case I've used.My ID and credit card are easy to get to and do not fall out, plus I have a place for some cash...I don't have to carry a purse if I don't want to."
"Works perfectly and ships rather quickly. Gave it as a birthday gift and she loved it. Will be definitely purchase again as another gift."
"This was an awesome story of love that survived through separation and tragedy.  A very touching story. I give it five stars."
"I decided to try these heads after reading many reviews, and knowing I wanted to give Evans another try but go clear this time(my last heads were Onyx and left me with mixed feelings) I've only spent a few minutes tuning and my toms already sound much better than before. Great sound, and a good price. Not sure how long they'll hold up but my next heads will definitely still be G2s."
"This game is so fun and it takes lots of skill to get through the levels. This game is enjoyable and great! I think lots of people should get the app."
"This book has it all... suspense, thrill, history, and romance. I couldn't put it down! Looking forward to the next novel by Joseph Halsted."
"got it in a reasonable amount of time, pretty and works well."
"have loved this movie for years and love the soundtrack as well."
"these are not real hematite but hematine and should be advertised as such. like them anyway."
"the description on the outside of the envelope said they were small beads."
"This book is a page turner.  I really enjoyed it.  The book also left off in a great place for a sequel."
"I bought this for my son for Christmas and I'm glad I ordered it with enough time to return it and purchase a different one. I opened it and pulled it by the handles to get it out of the box and immediately noticed that under the handles the plastic is sharp. The squares that you would hold with your hands is very uncomfortable just being squared in shape but it's even worse when the plastic at the underside of it isn't finished and has rough edges. This is not well thought out. I returned it and purchased the blue whale that has yellow plastic round finished handles to spare my kids' fingers and hands!"
"Torhment is my favorite now omg he is so caring once he lets go I was upset when autumn went away but was a so excited when she came back can't wait til next book to find out about my boys oh yeah. I believe my next tattoo will be Torhment across my back I just love him"
"the wrench it's not a universal size it works but not great really left me feeling concerned with stripping out my barrel nut  and it isn't a tight fit for my stock nut either"
"Based on reviews I ordered a size up (I usually wear Small in outerwear), so it fits just perfect. The coat is lightweight and well made, very warm, I highly recommend it. I love that it's elegant and fitted and not too sporty. Looks great with any clothes!"
"After product started getting air pockets for no apparent reason, I contacted Spigen thinking by them being a &amp;#34;High End Product&amp;#34; that they would replace their expensive product with no problem.. Man was I wrong!! They wanted so much &amp;#34;Proof Of Purchase&amp;#34; and after I sent them pictures and Amazon purchase # they still wouldn't replace my EXPENSIVE screen protector!! So They Will Never Get My Money Again and I Have 3 Iphones and A Samsung Galaxy 3 that i'm always buying screen protectors for but NEVER FROM SPIGEN AGAIN!!!! Maybe they just treated me like that, I don't know, but it won't happen again!!! Signed, Lost Customer for good!!!"
"I purchaces two batteries from different sellers, the first one did last a little longer. The first battery lastes a whole day, the Anker battery, hands down is the better of the two! Ankers battery lasts me 2 days of very heavy use!"
"It didn't work with my At&amp;t, samsung galaxy s5.  I returned it."
"It can get frustrating at the start but will certainly make an addict out of you especially when you have someone to compete with. It is just annoying when you have a long zombie line with you and all of them fall down because you cannot control them anymore with one tap."
"I ordered the Uncle Mike's centerfire Magnum Band sling swivels, in order to install a sling on my Gamo Silent Cat air rifle. It was a perfect fit, and very easy to install."
"Obbesion has always been my favorite cologne, I've been wearing it for years, and always, without fail, get copliments on the fragrance, (Guys women absolutely love the way Ossession smells)"
"I have owned a Fossil watch before that performed beautifully, this Fossil watch has the same quality and performance I have come to expect from Fossil watches."
"This case is really perfrct for any Daryl Dixon fan with an iPhone 4. I have had this case since before Christmas and it has been through it's fair share of drops, but the case has always held firm. There is not a single crack or scratch to be seen and, although it's a thin case, it has protected my iphone wonderfully.The one semi-negative thing I have to say about the case is it is a tad duller in color than its picture, however, it still looks very nice and I have no real qualms about the coloring. I am definitely happy with my purchase."
"Great game for anyone who loves adventure games. I've only had the game for a couple weeks now, but have played it for hour an hours with friends. All of my friends love this game."
"To many cliff hangers in a short peroid of time.The story didn't flow as smooth as the river and falls."
"it pops off repeatedly, did not fit phone well, won't stay on this word count stuff is really really stupid"
"I loved it, reminds me of my family but we are not that rich.  A must read for all Danielle steel fans"
"Every game different  not as. Easy as it. Sounds. Pick which level you wantedBecomes a cha you don't want to quit playing makes you. Forget everything else and it exercises the brain"
"The light is much too directional and only covers a field of view of about 10 degrees each side. The microphone is very loosely held on its mount; it flops around like a fish out of water. The zipper on the bag broke the second time I used it and it's not big enough to carry, well, anything. I'm giving this 2 stars because the stand/mount/carrier is very versatile and I'll be using it often with a different light/microphone."
"I really like this pink case. It is cute and it goes great with my iPhone. At first it was kind of hard to figure out how to get the cover on the phone, but eventually it will snap on. Also, they give you a plastic shield to go on your phone, but it doesn't work. Overall its a really cute case."
"More of a photographic overview then expected. Hoping for a little more coverage of the filming and genesis of the films. The book is full of images I hadn't seen before, but very light textually. Still, highly recommended."
"They are really really far from skin colored. They look almost yellow. Did not hide my gauges at all. Would recommend going else where for these."
"Overall it wasn't too bad but the tip is white. so it doesn't hide the fact that there is a piercing. It is completely useless for me."
"Matches the picture perfectly. This matches my skin color great. The silicone is really good and easy to put in."
"Looks just as it does in the picture. My girlfriend loves them. They arrived quickly and in a cute box."
"I am stacking this with pes erase and i am having good gains.  Only drawback is it is a pain to have to weigh each dose of powder. make sure you invest in a accurate scale. This stuff really needs to be put into capsules as it DOES NOT dissolve. i take it sublingually with water and it tastes citrussy and not too terrible though. Still good value for price"
"This book was very  entertaining and light to read. It is a story that keeps you amused but let's you relax as it flows well."
"I chose this review because the game is kind of fun but is very simple and not much challenge to it"
"This game is fun because it has several different bonuses and is just fun to watch. I like the way it keeps you interested"
"nice game that is fun to play. the colors that are used are great. fun match 3 game with interesting graphics"
"I like this game because it has nice colors and sounds and is fun to play. I also like the graphics that go with the game"
"Cute book. You can see the story line coming a mile away but it is an entertaining story though it seemed to go quickly."
"very awesome grill great for two easy clean up.well priced well made had one very small issue cosmetic aussie took care ASAP.would buy again and recomend to anybody."
"This is my second one perchased , my first was a few months ago but I ended up having to get a new car and had to order another one of these ! Easy to apply and looks great ! I love it !!! Well worth the $1 and change !"
"I found the movie to be very entertaining. The movie is in the same high class of movies that I enjoy such as: The Sound of Music, You Have Mail, South Pacific, etc."
"By far the BEST flat iron I've ever spent money on! Unfortunately my husband ended up stepping on it &amp; breaking it (it fell in the floor &amp; he was in the dark) now I can't seem to find it anywhere! :-("
"I only bought this flat iron bc my husband accidentally broke my K2 flat iron. Not as great as the K2 but I like that it's more sleek &amp; thinner. It's still a good flat iron though."
"its like the 1 pic Multi word version pf 4 pics 1 word for Tv series fans &amp;amp; couch potatoes"
"the wrist strap would only go over a real small hand and the belt holster is a joke, the unit snags in the holster and has to be fumbled with to get out.  that takes security out of the picture.  one of the electrodes was loose, easy fix but just one more reason not to trust the overall quality.  i would avoid anything with this brand name."
"my fianc&amp;eacute; loves it he said he cant wait to get married so he can wear it and it looks great with my set ty!"
"on time and great product will be ordering a lot more I tell everyone about this!!!!! so if u want ink this is the ink to get"
"they are so beautiful and I love it I wear the engagement ring and I get asked where I got it and are they real love it"
"I rate this 2 stars cause I got this for my son and we charged it then he got to use it for a few hours then we unplugged it from charging and it wouldn't come on so we had to reset it and well im sending it back casue im not going to keep resetting  it everytime we charge thank you"
"I think the book really had potential for a strong, emotional connection to the characters and their struggles. However, the main character's internal struggle with her sexuality is minimally discussed. In fact, the external conflicts are somewhat skimmed over and never resolved, so it leaves you wondering what happened in the past hour of reading. The ending comes across as if the author merely wanted to meet a page limit- no resolution, no cliff-hanger, just stuck in book limbo. The book as a whole leaves something to be desired."
"These gloves are warm enough and seem pretty wind and water proof so far. The palms seem tough but the backside fabric not so much. Things that should be improved are the that the liners are loose and when you pull your hands out; the liners pull out too making it hard to put the gloves back on without some work readjusting. Also the finger tips have extra fabric on the tips making it really hard to work on anything small; I had to remove them when hanging Christmas light hooks and adjusting the volume on a car stereo can even be tricky. I always wear an XL glove and the XL in this case fits me well."
"Seems like a great boot but it does not fit to size at all. Purchased an 8 but this at lest a size 9."
"Great gloves, exactly as described. I would purchase these again. The touch screen functionality works very well. I am impressed over all."
"Worked a treat, really helped with marketing mindset too. Highly recommend this one for google users and advertisers every where"
"I like my Black Hawk holster so far I think it's going to be what I wanted. So far I am very satisfied with it. I think it's very well made holster and the way it's designed."
"I looks great in my kitchen and works perfectly. Love it.... :) Its a basic toaster that does exactly what I need it to do."
"My wife loves it it goes good with her other charms and it is well crafted and dots well on the bracelet"
"Excelente libro de Pablo no hay comparaci&amp;oacute;n drama aventura y suspenso todo en una vivenciaRealmente se lo recomiendo  a todos"
"This is one of the best movie of all times loved it enjoyed seeing a all time favorite watch it"
"My color wheel was defective.  When installed, the wheel would bind on the light tunnel and would not spin as it is supposed to do.  The TV would not start up.  I had to pay another $120 for a repairman to diagnose the problem.  It ran fine on his bench test but not when it was installed in the TV.  The repairman had to add a spacer on the wheel in order to pull it away from the light tunnel.  I wrote the vendor but they have not replied and they expressed no concern...only silence.  Had I known I would have to spend $120 for this wheel plus another $120 (plus gas and time) to pay the repairman to fix this vendor's defective wheel I would have simply bought a new TV set.  Buyer beware."

"Absolutely amazing... Buy a  truckers antenna with it.... I'm always in very remote areas I've yet to find somewhere I don't have full signal.... Just  buy the trucker antennas with it..."
"It was a really  good, no great book. I will never look at a cat the same way again. Erin Hunter is a great author with ton  of imagination."
"It is absolutely amazing book that I think is a good read for anyone I really likes the style of writing"
"It was an awesome book. I suggested it to all, I mean all of my friends. Another really good book is Finally, by Wendy Mass, the same author of this book."
"I thought it was an amazing book. So interesting! I think that Wendy Mass is definitly a great author! Wow!"
"It was pretty good, though it wasn't my absolute favourite. I suggest Finally. That was an amazing book  that I read over and over again."
"Bought this necklace for my mother as a birthday present and she loved it! Very nice quality and looks amazing. If you are thinking about this I highly recommend it. I spent hours and hours looking for a necklace and I'm glad I went with this one. Who ever you are giving this to will love it."

"It's entertaining for a few minutes but then it gets old and I want my money back. There is simply not enough content. I would rate it four if it were free though. It's fun but definitely a free sorta app. Waste of money."
"I love this game, It's a building game but It doesn't get insanely boring after you make everything because it's also an adventure game. I love building games like townsmen but that got old, this didn't."
"Colorful and heavy,thought might be cheap looking but it's nice. Should be good for outdoor display. Thanks for nice product."
"These are the best considering the price...they'd have been better if they were a little longer but for the price, I think they are good enough."

"I absolutely love this shoe!  This is my third pair in this particular style.  No 'breaking in' issues... These shoes fit comfortably from the get go!!  Looking forward to seeing some new styles, Aerosole!!!"
"I'm 5'4&amp;#34; and 140lbs. I am curvy, so I bought a large. In hindsight, I would have been fine with a medium. My bust is really large but my waist is rather small so I usually have a really hard time finding costumes that fit correctly and don't make me look like a complete prostitute. I was really quite pleased with this costume. It came on time and in really good condition. My only real complaints were that the belt was WAY too large (but with two safety pins it was a super easy fix) and the boot covers would not stay fastened (but I ended up just tying the straps together and didn't have any more issues).All in all, this costume was a huge hit and suited my needs perfectly. I highly recommend!"

It loads then after less than a minute it re loads. It just keeps on doing this no matter how many times you restart it. There is just so many days to complete this quest, but can't play to do it. Please fix this newest problem."
"I have used this product in the past and loved it. It is the perfect blend of lotion. It does not have tingle."

"My wife is in love with this card case, mini female wallet.She takes it everywhere.THe cards are a tight fit and if you have any stuff in the zipper, then it can get difficult to take cards out.  But id rather have tight cards than loose card slots."
"THe children love their new trampoline.It is fairly easy to assemble, once you have made a mistake or two!In other words, it requires better assembly instructions.The blue spring protecting material on the edges is a little bit flimsy.Overall, I am happy with this purchase."

"I loved this HAIR I uses this HAIR over abt five  times maybe longer if I would have sew it in I cut it flat iron and rolled it"
"It's not everyone's kind of music, but dam does it go in hard with really addictive beats harmonies, and powerful words. if you never liked Rundgren before, this album is a good reason to. he's an innovator. the technology aspect to the cd feels primitive compared to nowadays, buts still interesting to remix the vocals and beats, not to mention this stuff was cutting edge back in the day.  it also came really fast and in the original package too, always a good thing."
"This game system, o how it was slept on it in my past life unfortunately.  PLease Dreamcast, never go away.  PLease stay, please stay, please stay.  It came on time, and there was nothing wrong with it."
"It came in original package, which is always a good thing. it works fine, brand new as promised. its useful for typing of the dead, which i was obsessing with when i had the keyboard. i don't know how many other games use it besides a few shooting games, but it sure was great using it for typing of the dead."
"This game is original.  It has cool characters and a nice range of attack and weapons.  Starting off you play with two usable characters. One is weaker yet faster, the other is slower yet stronger.  The only thing i have against this game is the fact that the music can be really, really annoying, and the control is a little stiff. Oh, and you'll get stuck in the early quarter of the game.  I still don't know what to do."
"Alright, so I was looking for a Sega Dreamcast game that would peak my interest enough to get me obsessed with it, and this is one of them.  The music and gameplay is amazing, and the impressive graphics are seemingly flawless for the mystical fantasy rpg style this game has to do offer. Throughout the game you meet characters from different games who you can switch the main charcter with to clear levels.  Levels are caves, condemned buildings and palaces with dungeon chambers on the inside as mazes.  You go from one room to the next fighting enemies and capturing ones at your leisure to train for fighting.  At the end of searching the entire area, you fight a final boss, who you should be able to beat if you've leveled up enough.  It takes good tactic skills to ensure your victory as the game progresses, and knowing what armor to be equipped with.  By the way this game DOES NOT have a good case for armor either because you can collect barely any items without having to drop another one in exchange, then using it, to acquire the next item. You try to preserve and contain your list with healing items, but this in turn requires another sacrifice.  This is one of the only super annoying things about this game; that is the limited  bag to hold items.  You will find yourself repeating some levels over and over again because well, simply put, you weren't strong enough.  See, this game has a certain technique to it that you have to master.  It's called avoid as many enemies as you can unless you know they are weak and will level you up.  Otherwise you're gonna make super progress that amounts to nothing once you die!  What Timestalkers, you never heard of checkpoints?  And why is the main character so annoying?  Otherwise this is a must have classic.  It's the original disk, unlike the replica put on Ps2"
"it came in the original, as if i haven't said that enough times. I'm such a fan of original art.  So this game feels like it came straight out of japan.  The story is fun, and game play is cool.  This one is definitely best on multiplayer."
"While the PS2 version is a little easier to play, and English subtitles can be annoying to read all the time, when you're dealing with an original classic, who cares?  You can easily get used to the controls, the graphics lag in no way whatsoever, it came in the original case.  Did I mention the game is original?  It's a greta beginners item to the franschise, and truly showboats how impressive the Sega Dreamcast is"
"This game has as many quirks and defects as a game could get.  The graphics and illustrations look like they were done by an 8 year old.  The story is wild and wierd.  Unfortunately, it's just not good enough to play without a few beers.  You'll find the control and special moves in particular are awkward, and if you never heard of Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure, this game in my opinion, is no biggie to miss.  If you're a collecter of wierd and random things however, you should buy it."
"Not only did this come in the original package, but  this game works perfectly.  You gotta love the arcade version, but in my opinion this is better.  It gives you a super rush every time you're trying to type sentences and difficult words in seconds before you're clawed  and killed by zombies.  The characters are memorable, and it's fun looking at the agents with their keyboards.  If you need to get your adrenaline running, typing of the dead is for you, not to mention it'll upgrade your typing accuracy for life.  Talk about a creative idea!"
"The greatest Spiderman game ever made? I don't know about all that.  However, back in the day when we were playing the Nintendo 64, this game was a pretty big deal.  I always wanted to see this game redone with perfected graphics, and the Dreamcast version comes pretty close to it.  I mean, it looks like PS2 basically, and this game started 64 bit.  Nice going, Sega.  You're SpiderMan and of course what does Spidey do? Wall crawl, explore the skylines, beat up baddies, challenge villains, and rescue damsels in distress all the while managing a hectic college life and part time photo journalist.  In this game you save hostages, climb, swing, crawl and explore various levels while encountering different other Super Heroes such as Daredevil, Punisher, and Black Cat.  You fight a variety of Spider Man villains; namely Dr Octopus, Mysterio, Venom, Scorpion, Rhino, thugs and snipers.  It has a lot of beating up and switch finding in it.  Surprisingly the control scheme is alright though a couple spots here and there can be a little confusing as to where you're supposed to go.  It's a classic beat em up game, with original voice casting from the show.  Listening to Stan Lee narrate is always cool, and it has a lot of features from other Marvel characters.  The biggest improvement is the graphics.  They were terrible on the N64.  So if you want a better looking version of this game that has pretty much no control trouble and a fast paced, easy and exciting story to get into, this game is for you.  By the way, the Carnage battle at the end of the game is pretty lame.  So is the run from Dr Octopus at the end.  Just sayin."
"You know, people talk about this baby like it's a total abomination. It's courageous I'll give it that, and it also was innovative around a time when no one wanted to do add ons. At least, not till Sega did it. So I give Sega props for 32 x. I don't think it's ugly, in fact, I think it looks neat and easy to hook up. 3 cords are a little over bearing, but the bigger issue is getting the thing to work. It does not like to work. I'm being so serious. You have to clean it with alcohol and try again and again and again. But hey, it upgrades the Genesis and makes some games sound really good, like Mortal Kombat 2. Great game by the way, though I've heard people don't like it. All in all, I give the 32 x a thumbs up because it's a nice touch for Sega and some of the games look really kool for it."
"This game is one of those discs that, if you never heard of it before or played it, and heard the great reviews from other gamers, you'd probably think its top of the line.  For the 16 bit world, it's not bad.  It has some really nice extras in it; the music when you fight Dr. Robotnik is fun to hear, not to mention some of the music from the other levels when you travel through time, and the graphics are nice and colorful. OVERALL HOWEVER, the music comes off as slack, the levels can be dizzying and annoying to tamper with, and Sonic does not have the lovable easy speed mode (you know, where you simply hold the dpad down, and rev up with the ""a"" button? It's more difficult to do in this one.  You have to play it to know what I mean.  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 did this PERFECTLY. WHY NO ONE DUPLICATED THE PERFECTION OF THAT GAME IS BEYOND ME.  Plus, the 3D effects were really too early on to be terribly impressive. This game would have been better perhaps simply as a model for gameplay to come, not as its own independant disc.  Overall, as a Sonic fan I had to buy it, but it's not on my greatest games list.  You gotta be better than the old games Sonic, otherwise, you'll always get slammed.  Now the game is not impossible to get into, it's just that it needs perhaps a better introduction and cut scenes.  Without these the game is not that captivating, though it is a little refreshing to play a Sonic game that requires more accuracy and brainpower in spots such as in Casino levels when your'e bouncing off springs and such. It's really hard to describe the twist and turns in a Sonic game unless you've played it yourself, and most everyone has, and arguably everyone has their own acquired appetite that may be satisfied by this awkward game.  It's not the worst and it's not the best. It's cool to have that extra glitter in the sparkles when you're invincible and it's not like the bosses are too hard to beat, it's just that the past present scheme to the game doesn't feel too significant and the game will trip you out easily with the level designs.  Besides that the past and future signs don't do much besides change the design in the back with buildings and such."
"I mean, it's power rangers. Did you like them growing up? I didn't but then again, I have nothing against them now, so I figured I'd throw it in the collection. With what results? You get to listen to the Power Ranger theme song over and over again until you have to turn the game off. Otherwise it's kind of cool, especially if you never watched the show growing up. It's a great way to get some insight about the show."
"Simply put, the first Supernova is way better.  This one just doesnt have a wide variety of music.  There are some awesome classics, but they come inbetween few and many.  The music should be better.  Otherwise, it's,.....ok :/"
"After reviewing the Sega Cd and watching someone else play it, its safe to say that you cannot expect much from this unordinary game console. So, what did Jurassic Park have to offer that most games on the Sega Cd don't? For one it has some 3D perspectives that were pretty neat for its time, not to mention the story and quest is solid.  It's nice to hear the Dinosaur Professor teach you things about all the different Dinosaur species.  It didn't rub off on me too well at first, but it eventually grows on you, and if you have a well balanced appetite for old and new things, this game should satisfy to an extent.  The graphics are nice; very well detailed not to mention you get to use several different weapons and interact with a good variety of animals through out the game.  The fun ends there however.  The puzzles you get stuck on in this game are some of the most irritating ones ever not to mention the game takes far too long to reload when you die.  The puzzles are irritating mainly because they are all more so about timing certain sequences and find that ""EXACT spot on the screen.""  That sort of stuff is what produces migraines!!!  To make matters worse, and to end this review, let's talk about the end of part three on this game.  Once you begin to find the Dinosaur eggs you need and realize they have to go in the incubator, you feel fairly confident you can get through this and finally end this rare and curious adventure. But then the ultimate glitch occurs.  You find after defeating the T Rex that next you go into a cave to pick up Raptor eggs.  You have night vision goggles and finally you can see where the heck you need to go,and it stops there. I even watched the walkthrough, which the player would not answer my question for me (???)  You approach a well where you notice a card you need to open the next door in the proceeding room.  Well, you can't reach the card; you have to throw two rocks in to raise the level, and THEN grab the card. And that's the problem.  There is no second rock in sight anywhere on the game.  I heard that perhaps in the water tunnel the second rock is around, but it's not there either.  So for me, the biggest problem with this game is you CAN'T FINISH IT.  Where the heck is 2nd rock for the well???  The game has nothing more to offer besides a few special effects that were new for the time, interesting facts, and some corky yet entertaining motion video.  Other than that, this game is a collectors item or for the birds."
"You're gonna need it in order to play the sega 32 x, so it better be good you know? I like it a lot. I mean, it came quick and I've had no problems, so who's complaining?"
"Well, they just don't feel the same as normal earrings. You can feel the metal tryna go through your ear, and its a little painful. They also fall out occasionally and you might lose them if you're not careful"
"I like it that it's easy to install it. I wish it wouldn't vibrate as much. I tried putting the rubber inserts that it comes with but it still shakes as I drive."
"Just what we needed to get the job done. My son was rebuilding a bunch of stuff on my car and he needed some infor about my car and this book helped him finish the jobs!! Great buy and great seller, Thanks"
"It was worth the money. $14 bucks and its very durable and heavy. My husband enjoys it very much. Love it"
"I love this book couldn't put it down the only reason I didn't give five stars was for dialogue of all the characters seemed to be sarcastic which made a bit unrealistic to me, but good read"
"This is a great deal; however, there where fewer red and blue markers than I would have liked.  Good value for the amount of markers."
"Doesnt stick on to my phone too good it comes off by it's self some times I needed up taking it all of waste of my money"
"Does as advertised, but not up to a mile. signal improved tough. Yes worth the cost, very cost effective. John"
"I use to get this for my dog from the department store. You can no longer really find these at the store. This is a great deal. The price here is about the same as the store. Any way my dog loves these. I get her all three flavors! Im soooo happy I found these!"
"The boys are just amazayn. When you think about it their was a lot of loans the boys had to take out to get this far. One of my friends thought that one direction was just stuck up and snobby  (how dare them I know) but when she read this book she realized that they really are caring and kind. I mean sure they have lots of money, but that's not the most important thing to them."
"very good game. the mew is way better tham the old. old has onily nine levels but the new has i think fourteel levels on it."
"When I tried my thumb It wouldn't accept It, then I tried again and it worked. I don't trust it when I need to unlock my kindle"
"Love it. Love the color. Because my head is too small for hats, this works perfectly. Again I love it"
"This was recommended and I couldn't be happier. I love the southern edge and thought the main char were well written. Nothing was lost in over description the book actually moved forward without getting lost. Not an erotic at all. This can be read by teens."
"Great dish, it is a joy to cook inUse all the time for making prime rib it holds the heat fantasticrecommend highly"

"never had a problem with force closes on my kindle or my phone, app runs great and the game is fun."
"Great t shirt. high quality materials. lumpy head"
"I loved this book because it held the gritty details of only a child surviving the mental illness of parental addiction could tell. It tells the story of how extremely difficult a child has to fight to survive day to day, month to month and year to year in the crazy chaotic world an alcoholic parent creates for their child.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants or needs a better understanding of the battle a child of an alcoholic parent faces or has endured.Thank you Marlayna for being brave enough to live through it and tell the world about it. You amaze me."
"I LOVE BATMAN SINCE THE RE RUNS OF THE TV SERIESI HAVE SEEN ALL THE BATMAN MOVIE  VERSIONSTHESE ARE GREATBUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE GREATMY FAVOURITES ARE TIM BURTON VERSIONS"
"CNN news right at your finger tips. Easier to find out what's going on in the world then actually watching CNN."
"Its entertaining. Wish it had different themes. The controls are a bit too sensitive. Sometime you want to jump but instead you go to the left."
"Did nothing against the odor. Even though I spot tested before use, when I actually used on a spot it left a yellowed area which was not there before.  Will try again to see if that result was not the normal."
"It was a cute idea and item but it was made poorly it the spikes didn't stay on at all waste of time"
"The case is cute was delivered on time was a great price bc they cost like $30 in the store but when I received the item it didn't fit on my phone so it was a waste of my $"
"Nice price. Great book for beginners. My three year old isnt that into it compared to his other books but his cousin a 5 year old really likes it so I guess its better for school age kids. Overall good purchase."
"My little one loves this book! Great size for him too. I didnt realize it was a board book till I got it but happy cause its easier for him to hold and not too small that he feels like its &amp;#34;a baby book&amp;#34; which he doesn't like lol."
"Got this for my 3 year old son and my 5 year old nephew. It was on sale for 4.50!!! I love them. They were very easy to use perfect size for them and really got there attention! This was my first volcano kit too and I was really into it!!! Its so much fun! Great price and definitely recommend even for older kids Im in my mid twenties and I couldn't wait to use it! Its great for all ages Its not very tall which is sensible since you cant keep them anyway. It was really easy to use and paint! You will need your own vinegar and baking soda and food coloring if you prefer that I just added the red paint into the vinegar for ours. Anyways excellent purchase I recommend this to everyone!!!!!"
"Arrived quickly needed if for a party on sat order thursday night came friday night!!!! (in NYC) Good for small cakes or for little designs. If your making a bigger cake buy more then one!"
"This is my fourth pair I get one every year for xmas for myself. This is my second grey pair the others got so worn out they got a hole in them! I love them I used them all the time!"
"but cheaper then buying it elsewhere but that is just because its dora :( otherwise great quality and packaged nicely. I think its more suitable for a toddler or younger gal."
"Pricey!!! I get fleece blankets at walmart for 2 bucks! But I was buying for the character for a handicapped boy who loves scooby doo he cant play with much so this was a good gift for him! After a few washes the string on the outside comes out but it was washed frequently in a short time so maybe thats why! If your buying for someone who cant use toys its a good buy if they can play with toys I recommend you spent the money on the toys better because the quality isn't the greatest!"
"I write this review one day after learning of the death of Charlie Haden.What a way to go out!This is a brilliant recording.They were done at the same time as their 2010 recording &amp;#34;Jasmine&amp;#34;,but even the alternate takes of two tracks are different and take my breath away.Keith Jarrett's playing has never been better and Mr. Haden's double bass,while subtle at times,never fails to capture the emotions he is trying to express.Their versions of these standards are nothing if not amazingly beautiful.As Mr.Jarrett said in the liner notes to &amp;#34;Jasmine&amp;#34;four years ago-&amp;#34;Call your wife or husband or lover in late at night and sit down and listen&amp;#34;.Buy this recording.You will not be sorry.R.I.P.Charlie."

"Nice and economical set of different widht and length microspatulas.When transferring either for weighing or production you cna readily manage powders of all granularities."
"We really love this poster. We have it in my granddaughter &amp;#34;Paris&amp;#34; themed room. We like the fact that there are other scenes of Paris than the Eiffel Tower. We had it applied to form core to give it more stabilty in the frame. Her room will look great when we are done!"
"This poster is a good one but not really what I was looking for. The blue car didnt fit the color scheme of the room and the dark sky gives a gloomy depressed feeling. We are focusing on the ""Paris Theme"" in my granddaughter's room and want to make it a fun room. She is a pre-teen and didn't care for the public display of affection."
"Very slim and has a nice grip. It looks like you don't even have a case on it really though"

"These are super cute BUT way small! I usually wear a 6.5 to 7.5 . I ordered a 6.5 first , too smallSo I ordered 7.5 and again too small.  They're npt too narrow (although they are a relatively narrow shoe) just too short. My big toe is the only issue.Maybe they'll stretch."
"this cleans very well and pretty fast. it has a nice citrus scent and i like the fact that it is all natural. i just wish it wasn't so expensive."

"This item took twice as long to arrive as any other purchase I've ever made from Amazon.  This glove provided little of the warmth I was looking for during my time on the sidelines coaching football.  Ended up having to buy a different Under Armour glove from the local sporting goods store, higher quality cold gear at a cheaper price.  This is the first negative experience I've had, hopefully there won't be any others."
"Got this case for my Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy S2.  The looks alright but around some of the edges the sticker print is peeling right out of the package.  Real fast delivery.  The pen is pretty cool.  The screen protector is nice but they should have reversed the way you put it on because I would think you would want to match up the cut-outs first when you stick it on for the first time.  The top corner of the snap together doesn't stay snapped all the time sometimes it pops apart.  Overall the phone fits in perfect and it will save it from some damage for awhile.  Don't know if the case will stay together though if dropped.  I'm going to order an otterbox right after this review."
"So having read the book, I too was at first confused on a lack of stuff from the book. However for anyone who read it, that movie would have had to been a lot longer to include it all! When you realize that, they included a lot of good stuff!! I really enjoyed Chase Williamson as David! I think he got it perfect, and the Dave/John dynamic was excellent!!! I will not include any spoilers, however I will say to anyone who has not read the book, you will more than likely not have any clue what the hell is going on, so just watch it for entertainment!!!I really hope this movie does well enough for the sequel, because TBIFOS is definitely movie worthy!!!!"
"AT FIRST I WAS THINKING TWICE ABOUT BUYING THE HAIR BUT I SEEN HOW IT LOOKED WHEN MY BESTFRIEND BOUGHT IT SO I DECIDED TO ORDERED IT. I DID A 2 DAY SHIPMENT  AND IT WAS HERE THE TIME THEY SAID IT WOULD.. I HAVE IT IN MY HEAD NOW AND I LOVE IT... I WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN!!!"

"I spent a good deal of time looking for a multi CD stereo, and this one fit the bill perfectly.  It looks great, sounds great, and meets my expectations for an inexpensive audio system.  The only negative comment I have would be how noisy the actual changer operates.  Otherwise, it is absolutely wonderful to listen to my large CD collection again.  Just call me old now and be done with it.  ~ Enjoy"
"These splatter screens come in very handy while cooking, and help keep the stovetop clean.  They are a bit flimsy though..."
"Very fun, great multiplayer, good graphics, just a great game overall. Fun for everyone. Need to write a few more words"

"I thought I was buying a set of pillow cases as the information was not clear on that when I ordered.  Instead there was only one pillow case ---- very expensive for one pillow case.  however the picture was clear and my twilight saga loving daughter was screaming with delight when she received it."
"I got this back in October and I love it! My little daughter has dropped it several times and I will tell you I am glad I had that Otterbox! WORTH THE PRICE!"

"Lisa Gardner has written another page turner.  You can almost feel the main character's desperation to learn how to protect herself from her evil Ex. The book held my interest from start to exciting finish."
"Having been a fan of this author for many years and having had the pleasure of meeting her in person at book signings; I am always eager to read her latest work, whether it is about her many two legged or four legged friends.  Anyone who loves mysteries and CATS would enjoy her writing."

"This adapter works great.  I'm plugged in when not reading... and when I read for longer periods.  Its price was the lowest of the adapters."
"What we were looking for were the extension lines with microphone in each unit so everyone can hear when a call comes in.  This unit works great.  Now we have no problem getting to the phone, and don't have to run through the house to answer incoming calls.  Our main telephone line stopped working, and the only working line was in the office... on the other side of the house."
"The price is less than the local retailer's. I have extra filters for future projects. A few times they popped off of the mask without my knowing, but I may not have secured them properly. They worked for my purpose."
"Just for kids suggest it be placed under kids books , I am sure it would suit my 2 year old grandson as he is very good at art in play school"

"This product is great!!!Well worth the price spent! Will recommend this product to anyone, whether it be any individual doing their own nails at home, or professionally!!Very easy to use, and very convenient. Not to mention it is very wide, fits both hands or both feet well at the same time!!Clear buttons to specify how long the light and/or fan stay on as well!!A++++ ITEM!!"
"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE AND ROBERT DENIRO WAS FANTASTIC IN IT.  IT WAS ANOTHER ONE OF OUR VHS MOVIES THAT SORT OF DIED OF OLD AGE AND WE WERE SEARCHING FOR THE DVD.  LUCKY FOR US, AMAZON HAD IT.  WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THEM AND THEIR SERVICE.  GREAT COMPANY!"
"It's very convenient. No need to go to the store for the results. It's like a one shop store for all your needs."
"So far so good easy to warm up by rubbing hands together super easy to apply on skin smell is just right will be purchasing again!"
"This is perfect for me.  I don't have the strength to pull a cord.  This is easy to handle and does a great job on the small yard I have.  The battery charge usually lasts me three cuttings.  Awesome."
"This guitar sucks. It really does. Buy it if you want too. I don't have it, but the price and looks give it to you."
"Sort of like the new monopoly for us! We really love it. There are different versions out there, with easier board set up but they get a little expensive and I didn't think it was worth it.  I'm very happy about my decision"
"I didn't love it but it was easy to ready and usually very interesting.  The writer has  flare for writing"
"Pretty colors and comfortable. Sizes are accurate. Launders very nicely; No stretching or twisting. Keeps its shape well. I will purchase these again."
"This classic movie will never get old.  It's still as fun and scary as the day Disney first released the movie.  The animation and story telling are top-notch."
"For the money, this deal couldn't be beat. When I'm ready for some more speakers. I'll be sure to shop here."
"100% well made, perfect condition, no issues.  The only thing that could have made it better was to put $20 in it.  I did. :)"
"I didn't need the entire book, but what I did need was perfect. Helped me learn some short cuts on my TI-83. Good book"
"I had actually bought this for my father since he likes to cook jams and jellies. I was a little worried it would be poor quality like his last pot (he bought it at kohls or some place like that), but it was actually perfect! I think it has been 2 years now and besides a few little scratches here and there, it is still has very good structural integrity. Great quality!"
"This is a good little vacuum.. I bought it for my dorm room and it cleans the tile really well. I also have a rug and it does an okay job on that. It leaves behind little pieces of string that is stuck to the rug. But it is perfect for a dorm room. I bought it for $20 at Wal-Mart."
"This is a great product for such a low price. At first I was a little skeptical about getting it because usually you get what you pay for. I have not ran with this on yet, but it seems to be durable. It it made out of the same/or similar material that those little beer can holders are made of. When I opened the bag, I saw how big this case was and immediately was like ""Well that was a waste of money, this is way to big!"" I have the Incredible Droid 4G LTE (a smaller touch screen phone compared to others) but because this case is big it fits my phone with its case on perfectly! So this is a great product and allows me to use it without having to take my phone case off! Although when I take my case off of my phone and put it in the arm band case it is obvious the arm band case is to big, but that's fine because I rarely take my normal phone case off anyway. I recommend! Oh and it arrived two days before it said it would!"
"Does a good job but motor is not quite as powerful as I had hoped for. If you press very hard you can stop it. Otherwise a great product."
"Recommmend you purchase the extras as they are great value. Don't know how long the originals will last but it's always good to have spares on hand"
"Unfortunately I didn't see this movie till just a month ago, I'm can't I hadn't seen it earlier!  The one liners in this movie are masterful, and Karl Urban's portrayal of Dredd was spot on.  Perfect constant scowl!"
"Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow need I say more???  This book needs to be made into a feature film starring Halle Berry.  Very thought provoking.  Will be on Oprah's list of favorite things."
"I ordered this for somebody as a Christmas present... needless to say they cried from happiness when they opened it. I am not a Dr. Who fan myself but she is an avid fan, so even though she doesn't play guitar she still loved the present. Also the gift came almost 2 weeks earlier than it said that it would which was nice because it was here for our Christmas exchange!"
"Excellent yarn; and some interesting twists. Unfortunately, poor electronic typesetting wherein words are &amp;#8220;wrong&amp;#8220;, causing some senseless grammar and syntax detract from the story. Autocorrect gone wild. The author would be appalled. This problem worsens as the book progresses."
"My guitar, just Love it! This stand is exactly what I hoped it would be. It is all I want or need from a stand."
"had to sew some things because it had holes. but it was great after . very soft and cute. great"
"The package for all the screen protectors was perfect! Great quality! The number of screen protectors was just as expected."
"I like this product.  The taste is good.  I have not had my cholesterol checked since I started using it so I can't say if it has improved my numbers yet."
"Interesting characters and settings.  A little slow at times but worth the wait.  I am looking forward to the next in the series."
"Nice collection of shorter stories.  Normally I do not like &amp;#34;shorts&amp;#34;, but do admit this is definitely worth reading.  Fast paced!"
"Fresh new look and quality better than I expected.  Item fits oversized furniture well.  I would definitely recommend this item to others."
"I have worn these often.  Comfortable, cute and durable!  Definitely recommend these boots to anyone looking.  Bargain for the price AND I got free shipping.  What more could a girl want??"
"I have to admit, if I wasn't such a patriot/conservative and very concerned about the path of our country, I wouldn't have continued reading this &amp;#34;roughly&amp;#34; written book.  That being said:  if you can get past the bad editing, I feel you do infact have a pretty accurate picture of what the USA will/could be if we don't reign in our current president.I would suggest reading this book to friends but let them know that leeway must be given due to poor/no editing."
"I was really excited to shoot with this film pack but after shooting one exposure of it, the battery in the pack stopped working and the remaining 7 exposures went to waste..."
"You worth it! You are valuable, just because of you!!! She is funny, full of real life story that will make you feel, you are not the only one with weird questions. :)"
"My son loves this Luigi Plush toy. It is soft and looks just the same as the picture. He take it everywhere with him: perfect for heavy duty, too."
"If you need someone at your home, to inspire and help you with your daily work-out, this is the one! You won't be exhausted after, but will feel your body a little soar every day. It will make you use every muscle, but not at once. Great!"
"This is a really good game although I wish they'd make them in English am I right yeah y'all should download it"
"this product is ordered on December 20th and it came on the 23, one night before Christmas. So happy that my niece got it on time for her Christmas gift."
"Fit and quality is great, But I found Bali has the same type just well made at less than half the price."
"The fit and color is fine,but not what I would call flannel it is bed sheet thin guess that is why the picture is set so far back, It is worth the price just know what you are realy getting."
"it is much beatiful than the pic,i love it.the size is a litter big for me.i have to get rid of a length.it will be much better if amazon supply different size."
"The idea of the characters not knowing the hows and whys of the disaster were much in the vein of LOST. The connections made during the adventure especially at the end were very X-file like. I like."
"Wasting time and money I'm trying to return my money back.didn't get any results my Wight was 149 and now 155"
"I have bought these for about 6 years now for Christmas presents. Always a big hit with Husband, Son and Grandson."
"Bought this for my moms birthday, and she loves it, so do I. It toasts very well. I do recommend this product to others looking for a toaster."
"I received my book in a timely manner. Conditions of book was in good order. When placed in envelope for shipping, the cover and several pages got bent. Overall, a good deal for the price. Looking forward to finishing a hard to find series!"
"Item arrived 5-6 days after I ordered it! Love the material, and color.Im a mens small. I purchased the US Large. It fits perfectly. Make sure to get the right size!It's Korean sizes.Ships from CA."
"I bought this item in hopes to replace my screen on my third gen iPod touch. The connection was fine, everything seems to work, however it doesn't include a home button and there is no way to clip it in place like they're supposed to.There are other screens on Amazon that I would purchase over this."
"It was amazing book I loved it I loaned part out before reading it. Reading again is very amazingly relaxing"
"As a puerto rican myself and having gone through similar experiences as Dante I quite enjoyed this book. I liked that I could identify as some of the things did and do still happen in the island and make this book relatable and believable while still  maintaining the concept of magical realism. I found it really inspiring and thoughtful as it teaches a lot about working hard for your goals despite what hardships life throws at you which make this book wonderful and comforting for the teenaged community who's constantly struggling with issues as the ones presented in the book."
"It keeps you on edge and it's not overly dramatic. Feels real and perhaps that's what's scary about it. I recommend it."
"and i loved this movie,every minute of it,didnt get the advertising it needed,and a whole lot of problems with production,but non the less a great movie for all star wars fans,favorite part,the showdown with the trekkies!!!! lmffao!"

"I try to read a lot the free authors I haven't heard off to boost their ratings and Emma gets an A+.  Some of the self-published stuff I have read is terrible.  So bad I couldn't finish the first one.  I not only finished the first one but bought the second one so that should say something."
"We took these to Disneyland for our autographs books. The pen was big so all of the characters could sign easily with out a problem.  I also like the plastic snap holder it comes in to keep it protected while we were in the park and to keep it a little nicer for a memoir of our great trip to Disneyland!"
"Does what it's supposed to do. Fits perfect and will prevent me from getting a felony with my 30rd magpuls...ppprrrraaaatttt!!!!"
"New to herbal world....very informative.  Also, it mentions common uses and provides notes on proceeding with caution if certain health conditions apply like diabetes or advises not to use at all with certain conditions"
"No I don't like it because was made in China, when they made the products, they used bad material to made it. They are bad for people to used it. I am afraid to use it o give to my family."
"Fun, easy, but not so simple, it's boring!!! I did buy the upgrade, and I had points so it was still &amp;amp;#34;free&amp;amp;#34; for me. Even if I didn't I would've bought the upgrade, only $1.99."
"it lasted around two days until stopped working, not recommend to purchase. cheap but not worthy at all. I am very disappointed."
"It is the best one i have ever bought! The color is exactly what shows on the pic, I love it !"
"My charger was smashed when I received. I want a new one. It also took a long time to get here."
"It got here quick and it fits great. I love the stylus but i wish it was a mini stylus."
"We took this grill to a trade show ...it was perfect for cooking both pork loin and pancakes that we served to the attendees.Easy clean up, adequate size, consistant temperature."
"The lace part of this dress was far longer that the picture had led me to expect. I'm 165cm and 51 kg (sorry people I'm European) and the dress (size 6) fits perfectly, but while the fabric part barely coveres my behind, the lace fell well under my knees. Frankly it made me look like someone&amp;#8217;s grandma. The dress is still beautiful and quite well made, so I decided not to send it back and had it shortened."
"The oil clears up all imperfections on your skin, although the smell takes a bit of getting used to. The custemer service was great."
"I have played many games with many people and none of them ever came close to this one it's the greatest feeling when you get a new mutant or a rare one I give a thumbs up and I have 3 of them.........just joking"
"These Corso shoes are beautiful and comfy. The size fits great and I will also be getting these in another color! I love them!"
"These reeds make the instrument play  with a very good sound; also they last for a pretty decent amount of time."
"The quality is very good but I have troubles with the shape because:1. the tip of the closed-toe stockings is to large and therefore visible when wearing women shoes;2. the small size below knee stockings that would be my foot size are to short, so I am forced to use the medium size and lose in compression."
"Joe's best work to date. Love the more layed back style in the title song  &amp;#34;Sloe Gin&amp;#34;. A must have for any blues fan."
"I'm in love with this mint case. It's exactly like the picture shows. Ur getting exactly what ur buying. It makes my white s5 look simple but stylish. Reccomended."
"I like the Microsoft Step by Step book series. As a Tech. It makes research quick and easy. There's a quick reference section to recheck when someone already has basic knowledge."
"It fits my phone like a glove. I don't ever have to worry bout it coming off of my phone."
"A known classic and often required reading I can't believe I had not read this book earlier. A must read."
"This is an amazing game. It will keep your mind thinking. I absolutely love all these games. Highly recommend this game!"
"This model will not fit a ZGlock 21 Gen 4. It will not slide upon the trigger guard. Product did not ship with any instructions."
"The book made a few interesting points along the way, but never grabbed you and made you want to continue reading.  An interesting life I'm sure, but if there was a message here I couldn't find it.  It's almost like the discussion on habitat.  The book was very general  (habitat) and was never specific about any one thing (habitat for a particular species)."
"I do a spin or RPM class twice a week @ the gym.  It was becoming increasingly more uncomfortable to tolerate the little narrow seats that these bikes are equiped with.  I didn't want to go with a pair of bike shorts as I do other workouts there also.  These liners fit the bill perfectly.  They have enough padding in the right places &amp; are not conspicous under my regular gym shorts.  I've since bought a second pair and will probably own a third before the end of the year just to make it easier to keep them laundered and ready for use."
"This speaker is simply unbelievable!. The sound very loud and best thing of all is that it has real punchy bass. Even at high volumes the speaker never distort. I was really surprised by how good these speakers are.I own the following bluetooth speakers:GoGroveHMDX JamHMDX Jam PlusKinivo MiniSuper Bass Portable SpeakerX-mini Max II Capsule Speakersand after testing all of them i can say that the Sharkk BoomBox is a killer! There's no comparison at all. Previously, the HMDX Jam Plus was in my opinion the best portable bluetooth speaker, but after using this Sharkk BoomBox i can say that the Sharkk is the best portable bluetooth speaker Period.The reason behind this great sound is the fact that this speaker has two main &amp;#34;High frequency&amp;#34; mini speakers and one &amp;#34;low frequency subwoofer&amp;#34; speaker at the back. The two main in the front provide the awesome distortion free vocals while the one in the back is punching the bass. The combination of both the mini speakers and a the subwoofer provided the best music experience in portable speakers.So, the bottom line is go for it you will never regret it"
"Very good purchase. Spacious, practical and good fit bag for both mums and dads. Quality/ price ratio is there and there should be no reasons for you to be disappointed. Item is exactly as described."
"[t is something i always wanted and was very happy to find it.  i think it is special and very cute."
"A+ in all areas! My twenty year old loves all of the features and the sound. Fit description exactly! Happy!"
"Great buy for the money! Item as described and then some! Very rugged and efficient for my husband's iphone in his outdoor career."
"This rice cooker is perfect for our little family of 3.I was looking for a smaller zojirushi rice cooker, i had the zojirushi neuro fuzzy 10-cups rice cooker and it was huge.At first the non stick coating on my neuro fuzzy was starting to peel off and i needed a replacement pan.There's none available, even on zojirushi's website. The replacement pan was about $50+shipping.So when amazon had this no-fuss zojirushi rice cooker on sale for less than 50 bucks, i jumped on the deal.I keep the fancy neuro fuzzy in the basement now, and my new rice cooker is just perfect."
"The book was good, it was new like it said. But there was some delivery damage on its sides so it made me sad a little."
"It is used book but it did not answered my expectations, it is pretty old. Besides, there is not any missing page and it is good for study."
"I have VERY thin hair. Most products I use on my hair, especially conditioner and heat protection spray, leave my hair greasy. I absolutely love this product. I recommend applying it to damp hair rather than dry hair. It leaves my hair silky and soft. I will definitely continue using it and I recommend others to give it a try!"
"They are very versatile and  does the job just the way it is needed. The other people asked me where I got them and when I told them. They plan to look for them."
"he was so tickled that he got this toy that he wants the rest and this is the main show he loves a bunch!!!"
"I had my doubts about this product but it really works right along with the diet. Try it you will be surprised and happy about the results."
"Fun, challenging, and addictive. Flappy Wings offers fun for any age. I recommend it for those who seek light entertainment."
"This little book packed a lot of information in 224 pages...beautiful photos, great ideas and good information about the photos so that you can find what's depicted and described.  I liked that it was broken down into sections:  Garden Portraits, Digging In, Garden Structures, Plant Palette and Finishing Touches.  I actually checked it out from the library, and realized that I had to have one for myself so that I can refer back to it...as I'm sure I will again and again.  It truly showcases the very best in Southern garden design.  Highly recommended."
"I have been collecting these Southern Living Christmas books since 1995, and this year was just as wonderful as all the rest.  These are my go-to reference books for Christmas decorating, crafts and wonderful recipes for not only entertaining, but family holiday meals. I've found that while I save all my Christmas issues of the magazine, these books are what I always reference because everything I need is here in one volume. I love the complete menus for different holiday meals and entertaining.  The depicted decor is also just lovely, and offers several different ideas from rustic to elegant.  I'm happy to add this 2013 version to my collection."
"This is the best tool for diagnosing and correcting light strands that don't work...it is super simple to use.  The manufacturer's website has every video you need to easily repair any burned out strand even on outdoor lighted decor.  It also comes with very detailed instructions in the package.  We used it on our pre-lit tree where we had two problems.  One-one strand wasn't burning at all.  My husband simply used the tool as instructed and traced the wiring to the bulb that was causing the problem.  Voila!  No more burned out strand!  And, two-we had one bulb in another strand that was loose.  Once again, it took less than 5 minutes to find the loose bulb and voila...no more problem.  All I can say is that I wish we had this when we donated a pre-lit tree after hours of trying to repair it.  All our family members have borrowed mine, corrected their problems in minutes, and now I know what to get them for Christmas.  Buy this product...you will not be disappointed!"
"I am very happy with this Ahnu boot.  The comfort, great style and color is exactly what I was looking for.  After reading several of the reviews, I decided to go 1/2 size larger, but it actually is just a little large for me.  I normally wear a size 7.  It's not a big problem since I only wear these in the winter months, and adding a second pair of thin socks with my wool socks makes it fit perfectly.  I became familiar with the brand from a pair of very similar boots that I ordered for my husband.  I am not disappointed, and would happily buy this brand again.  Great boot for the money."
"These do the job. I would recommend to any nursing mom. They are much more comfortable than the paper/disposable ones."
"We bought this to use for a cross country trip (4 adults and a 4 month old). Worked GREAT!! Plenty of room and plenty of privacy. There was even room for the pack n play set up with 2 adults on one side of the tent with tons of room to spare. I loved being able to stand up in it too. I highly recommend this for families of all sizes and also for couples wanting a huge tent to spread out in. It's almost too big for just 2 people though."
"my first heli a bit of a challenge in a small space or outdoors but that's what i was looking for as its pretty fast. responsive. cheap, durable and loads of fun a great starter as ive crashed it countless times brought it to a birthday party and my brother and nephew are now placing orders how cool will that be,, i also ordered the big bag of parts and 5 pack of 200 mha batterys at the same time and i get better performance and longer flight time other recomindations are to protect the wiring on the rear motor i used heat shirnk tubing around the whole motor.. manually adjust the rods that connect the rotor and fly bar to the swash plate if it don't hover close to in one place then fine tune with the trim buttons and remember you tube is your freind"
"new to flying ive dipped into the bag 3 times once for a shackle that controls the fly bar where else am I going to get that part glad I ordered at the same time I ordered heli because coming from china it took 3 weeks to get here but when I needed it there it was I also ordered a 5 pack of 200 mha batterys also a worth while wait ,china,,but more power and longer flight time you will have to manually adjust trim as it will drift backwards with added weight"
"It was amazing, love the smell and so do all the girls. It might be expensive but so worth it."
"I bought this product to be sent as a gift to Venezuela. What a bad moment when I received a call thanking me for a product that did not work. Get what you care... Don't buy this..."
"The watch looks great. Its only 3ATM  water resistant means you can only get wet in the rain or wash your hand with it on, not for swimming, snorkeling, etc. the description says 99 feet depth thats all wrong the watch says on the back only 3atm. Other than that i love this watch."
"Looks very nice with my white phone. At the beginning i could not get it off, then i dropped my phone and broke the screen.It looks very cool but it will not protect your phone."
"Really annoying to put on. I had to try / waste 3 different covers to try and get the placement right and all the bubbles out. Corners lift too...wont buy again :(I would rather just go somewhere and have them put it on for me"
"Unfortunately the case does not have enough clearance to have on my phone while trying to charge it. You will need to take the case off. Also, the stickers are super cute but they pop right off and leave a sticky film residue"
"great songs,but wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was live,my fault I guess,wasn't looking for live version.have to be more careful"
"This bladder is much bigger than i thought it was going to be, and that was a good thing! plenty of space for your fluids and an easy nozzel you only need one hand to use!"
"This is a great product. At first I did not think that it worked, but the next time I used it I applied a little more and I could feel it working."
"I could hardly wait for this to come in. im in afghanistan right now, and all of my friends have cameras to take pics with, so when i got this it was exacatly what i had expected!"
"The game is awesome, i have beaten it multiple times on my xbox 360. the computer game however, you need steam to play. i am in a place where i cant get downloads, so now this game is worthless."
"These shoes are awesome! They're comfortable (way better than wearing my boots and working out in boots and utes). They did not even really need to be broken in. Good purchase!"
"Great product! I got def more than i needed though. I am not sure what I am going to use all this Hook/loop fastener for, but def worth the money."
"fun so far. graphics are very good and it does not take ridiculously fast motions to have fun with this game"
"I had the privilege of working with Roger in person as he was developing this book, and I can personally attest to its impact. Through the simple lessons learned through this text, I was able to gain control of my ulcerative colitis for the first time in seventeen years; I was also able to gain muscle tone, lose fat, and start an exercise program for the first time in my life. Roger's clear, insightful, logical, sustainable, and kind approach to explaining WHY certain dietary changes are necessary makes all the difference. There is no yelling, lecturing, jargon, or hype - Roger's writing is engaging, clear, and taps in to both your common sense and the heart of what is holding you back on your path to better health. As a lifelong exercise-phobe, and someone who is skeptical about &amp;#34;fad&amp;#34; diets, I found Roger's approach to both movement and eating to make it easy and feasible to make changes that I believed in, without having to force myself to believe in things I didn't. I have shared this e-book with my friends and family already, and I really suggest it to anyone who is looking to make a profound shift in their health."
"This book is for every family.  It can help move a struggling family to victory and healthy family reach even new heights."

"Because they fit her good like their suppose to and she likes them a lot the style and color of the shoes!!"

"I absolutely LOVE my phone case and so does everyone else! Vivi is so sweet, she kept in contact via e-mail with me to ensure I revived my package. She also sent an extra gift with the case. I will be buying from them again."
"This dash unit was easy to install and works great, but there are small holes in the back, so dont put anything small in the cubby or youll lose it forever!"
"As soon as i picked them up i noticed the ink cartridges were lighter than the empty ones i had.. weird i thought, and when i turned my printer on after installing these cartridges, it still said i was low on ink.. ugh, no good, now ill have to buy more.. rediculous!"
"The lights look nice, but they dont display the light evenly, my speedometer is brightest on 40 80 and 140, the othe side of the dash is just dim, i love the color, but the lights just dont display an even light thru the dash"
"I love the functions this player has to offer, and works great, connects bluetooth with my ipad and phone with no issues and pretty easy to use, i havent figured out yet how to hook up the DVD player to work, it just flashes e-brake muust be applied, but i didnt hook that wire to anything, may get to it someday.UNFORTUNATLEY, the one feature i really wanted to have, i cannot use, the bluetooth phone system, the calls come great thru the speakers, but noone can ever hear what I am saying unless i shout, and im not a quiet talker, but i have had to stop using it all together because the people im talking to are always complaining they cant hear me.If your looking to use this radio for calls, I would keep looking, there was only 1 review when I bought this, it basically said its decent for a cheapie, so i didnt have much to base it onHope this helps!"
"I love this case. It is so handy so that I don't have to drop my phone. Everyone who saw it wanted to know where I got it"
"It used to be that I'd have to plug in my phone at some point during the day.  Now I have 60% of the battery left at the end of the day.  I've never even had to consider using the second battery.  I'm now able to install a lot of battery-killing apps and use my phone to it's fullest extent."

"so far the speakers i purched are working just fine.they are in my truck and sound good just what i needed."
"In less then a week the items all faded and worn away.  They look horrible now on my pandora bracelet.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Lesson lived and learned."
"I should have known with the price the product would be cheap.  We used it one evening and within less then 3 hours the numbers on the balls rubbed off and were not legible and the cage was exactly what a paid for.....cheap.  ."
"Not the best quality out there, but perfect for the price.  It was used for a fund raiser so it was exactly what we needed."
"I am now officially a fan of the Kinncaid brother series. Jaycee gives the perfect balance of  intense suspense and hot 'n'steamy !!!  I'm already bummed that I am starting book 3 and there are only 5 Kinncaid brothers...... Maybe Katie and Jock will adopt.........  anyway, I am absolutely loving this series, I can't seem to put them down!!!"
"Such a great series.  I read all 5 books in two weeks, couldn't put them down!! Jaycee does such a great job of getting the reader invested in the characters and gives such intense plot lines that you don't want to stop reading. I fell in love with the Kinncaid family and am so sad that Jock n Katie didn't have 10 boys so the series can continue.  Maybe a story with Brody??????  I am now a huge fan of Jaycee's stories.  I read Hunted as well and it was awesome.  Time for me to go look for another Jaycee Clark book!!!"
"This is an energetic, upbeat song that is great if you're looking for something to dance to or if you're just looking for something to pump you up and put you in a good mood!"

HIGHLY Recommend for anyone with many passwords, or forgetful like me. My memory is not what it was when i was younger and this is a true asset. Nicely done."
"Wish i had bought this sooner. I love all the music on this CD. Was reminded of how much i LoVe their music, when watching THE Fog, one late night, and heard Salome's Wish come on. I Had to have the whole cd and am so glad I bought it. Heard it before at a friends house. Worth it. Buy it. Enjoy it."

"Absolutely Love this Oil. Great on my dry hands, elbows, and more, after the Harsh winter we have had, in NY state. Great for working out those tired muscles you have after a hard days work, or shoveling or yard work too. Nice for using as a massage aid too. Wonderful scent, Highly recommend this product."

Nice for having on hand in summer, whilst going to theme parks, flea markets, garage sales, camping, boating, etc. MANY many uses. Wonderful idea for all. Stronger than expected. HIGHLY Recommend for all Moms, Dads and Babysitters. Throw into your Glove box, Tool box, Fishing tackle box, purse, etc."
"I cannot say enough good about this movie. I had missed it in the Theatre, and was upset. I HIGHLY recommend this stunningly filmed, and family friendly movie. I am so glad i caught it on Starz, and came to Amazon.com to purchase it in Blue ray/3d/dvd 4 pack combo. I would wish that every family would spend a couple hours watching this interesting, beautiful, addictive to watch film. I hope with all my heart they make a follow up to the movie.I am sure many folks that missed it at the theatre, will appreciate it on film in their own home. Our new 3D television makes watching this in 3D, an added bonus. I appreciate the blue ray with commentary too. Draws your attention to what you may have missed the first time around. Makes a wonderful gift to give or receive. HIGHLY Recommend.AAA++++++"
"WOW. Better in person than any pictures show. Very accurate read on it. Took it out of the box, let it get room temp. as is cold here in NY state right now. Worked as soon as i stood on it. Love this scale. Glad i got an extra for my son for a Christmas gift. He is sure to love the upgrade, from his old Cave Weapon of a scale. That is why i bought myself one. My old scale would say you weighed something different each and every time you got on it. Trashed it the day this Wonderful scale came into the house. Thanks OZERI. Wonderful product."
"This is a must have size for us shellac ladies. I am so happy i bought the bigger size, so i don't run out quickly. My daughter and I love doing our nails, so I highly recommend this for all women. Nice size. Wonderful product"
"Wow like these a lot. So pleased with them. Bought as gifts for stockings, and way better than i was thinking would show up. Always hope for the best...Honest, reliable seller. Will buy from again. Wonderful gift, and for yourself. Good product"
"Cannot say enough good on the variety of these colors. I bought them in anticipation of spring 2014, as it is now winter 2013 in New York state. Will enjoy them for sure"
"Im so happy so very happy. Wonderful colors. Have the original white turbie twist, and finally treated myself to something i use all the time. Missed it immensely on my cruise and vacation, had forgotten it at home. Now one will stay in my suitcase as a reminder, and will refresh it, just before vacation. Never want to be without it again. My hair is long, and those Hotel/Cruise ship towels, are either TOO big or TOO tiny, to wrap up all my hair in, could not find one anywhere on the cruise for sale or on any of the side trips. HIGHLY Recommend for anyone in the hospital or nursing home, great to wrap up your hair in, so light and absorbent."
"SUPERB!!  BETTER THAN EXPECTED THUS FAR. WILL FOLLOW UP IF NECESSARY. I JUST NEED PV CHARGE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT A PERFECT SETUP."
"Exactly what I was looking for and the price was right Amazon is the place to go for anything you might need"
"We bought one of these about 6 months ago and within  a week my entire family was completely sold on it !!!  They are a wonderful device and every home should have at least one !  I have actually purchased 3 of them and just bought one for my father.  I have yet to change the batteries and have had not a single problem.  I was also very smitten with the ease of installation.  I am not the handiest person in the world but was able to install and program the lock, without help, in less than 10 minutes.  My only advice to any potential user is to replace the door knob with a knob without a lock on it - this keeps anyone from locking the knob before pulling the door shut.  I bought &amp;#34;passage&amp;#34; knobs for each door from Home Depot for $11.00 ea. - boom, no accidental lock out."
"It's an ok book. I would say itsthe best one out there but it is a better one that others to read. He seems to know his stuff...."
"If you drop your Surface this wont protect it like a otter box would. But over all I still like this case cover. I've had it for afew months now and have not noticed and issues such as the product breaking or cracking. Over all I am happy."
"I bought this because I am willing to try anything once to help lose weight... As far as the whole weight loss since i have been taking thesee there hasnt been any, not even inches. But I do sleep SO much better at night! Soif you are having a hard time sleeping try this. But don't expect weight loss."
"GREAT APP! For reading when on the go! I can catch up on my local news when I want to."
"This product has performed very well and was easy to set up and use. My only complaint is that one has to buy a wireless network adapter (at $70) to use the video-streaming features such as Netflix or YouTube."
"THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE BARNETT RC 150 CROSSBOW. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE A GOOD SHOULDER STRAP, BUT I CANNOT USE IT."
"Gave this to my Dad who is a Vietnam Veteran and he loves it, He used to have a Ka-Bar when he was in the Navy and this is just as good of quality as what he had, He shows it off to all of his friends."
"Just like all of the other helmets I have for other college teams, well worth the money and the packaging it came in was wonderful"
"These screen protectors are great fingerprints do not stay on the screen, it does not scratch, I have dropped the phone on the screen and there was not 1 scratch"
"Product went on well, sanded easily and end result looks great. Only time will tell how well it will stand up to hot and cold cycles. Customer support is EXCELLENT. They were extremely helpful and quick to respond to my questions."
"After trying the Dixson Bass Drum Lift and listening to two bass drums side by side, one with the Dixson Lift and one without, we decided to make the investment and distribute the Dixson Lift through out the United States. This simple but effective drum accessory will create a lower tone, deeper sound, or what ever you wish to call it. All we know is drummers try it, and smile, and that says it all!! You don't drill any holes and you don't scratch your beautiful hoop. Light weight and small it will slide right into your gig bag or leave it attached to your pedal. Try it and you will never play another gig without it."
"The author has chosen to tackle not only an important subject, but an industry that is ripe with Docs who consider themselves just slightly higher than The Almighty. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an alternative to conventional medicine offered as the standard of care. The standard of care is not for everyone, especially those looking to treat the underlying problem and not the symptom. Nicely done Steve Harte!"
"The system and hardwire is fine. I can't resist install Ubuntu on it as soon as I receive the package. In the era of touch-screen, the cost of this kind of traditional computers are lower and lower. A good example of high performance at low cost. I don't know whether it is made in China as Chinese products are increasingly better now. Last words, Far Cry 3 can run very well on this computer!"
"great product, but I like the one piece better than two pieces case.  you can try the other Anker clear iphone 5 case.  its good!"
"most durable iphone 5 skin or case.  very slim and hard.  try dark colors because the color strip sometimes get dirty or jeans can transfer the color to the case !!!"
"Looks as though to be a quality product.  Form fit and function are all there and it bolted up nicely replacing the worn out hub/wheel bearings with no major issues.  Time will tell the true quality of the product (and if im bored one day may update) but for the price as of initial install and one day of driving I am very happy."
"I purchased for my nephew who loves the set of Skylanders and this just added to his wonderful collection! Great!"
"Cute, sturdy, and I get compliments for it all the time! Easy to use camera, too...no blockage. I highly recommend!"
"I love the item, and it does really makes difference on my skin color, i admit you won't get very light skin immediately, i am sorry if i only give 1 star at first, cause the first time i ordered, i didnt arrive at all. but considering by the products result, i am pretty happy :)"
"The watch is really beautiful and elegant. This product is an excellent gift for women, I recommend this product ."
"pretty awesome gun. I've had this gun for about a month now and nothing wrongs happened to it yet. Definitely would recommend  to all my friends."
"This is 10x better than clash of clans. Easy to make money and not spend a penny! Very fun and enjoyable."
"This CD is not just for babies!  It is so relaxing, soothing, and just makes you feel good.  And with &amp;#34;The Voice&amp;#34; of Linda Ronstadt, it just does not get any better!  Her voice is absolutely incomparable!"
"I really enjoy the size and feel of this Rider and it is great because it is heavy enough it doesn't come up when you do. My only issue is I will try to pose it in an upright position and it will not stay in place. It will slowly drift back towards the torso area."
"This suit is so incredibly cute with super bright colors and great quality. I purchased the size M and when I received the suit the top was a medium and bottoms were a large. The size medium top fits very small...would work great for a size A or B cup but larger would look funny due to the padding and underwire. I am keeping the suit because I love the color combo and I am going to try and find a matching top on my own."
"This toy looks very slick like it would feel like glass but is made of cheap plastic that was not completely sealed (had rough seams). After one use the light stopped working. It is a great size and I enjoyed that and the vibration but would not suggest to others."
"Amazing sound( even when max volume) no distortion. very simple to set up and the wireless is impecable.Well done Sony!!"
"The phone case wasn't for me. It was for my little brother. Arrived on time and does everything he needs it to do. Protects his phone whenever he drops it and is pretty durable!"
"The print and binding are excellent and it ever retains that odd Japanese book store smell similar to bamboo and/or a tatami mat; however, the content contains mostly Toho and Daiei monsters from the 1970's.  Strangely, this book has a Godzilla paper cut out which would make it a good child's book.  Also, the latter third of the book is devoted to fan art which appears to be drawn by child.  A very curious book indeed, but not for any serious fan of past and present Dai Kaiju movies."
"There are not too many fixtures that take the T6 Lamp, but if you got one, this is a inexpensive replacement; however, it's spectrum output is 2700K so be prepared for it to be a little more yellow than the 5000K Cool Whites."
"If you're a child of the 70's and 80's, this DVD collection will bring back all your memories and at a price that your wife will not send you to the couch.  ;)"
"I enjoy the control of wooden cotton swabs, but this brand's cotton tends to be occasionally thin at either end.  Best to check the thickness of the swab's ends before using them for health applications; otherwise, a great value."
"Item appeared to be of acceptable manufacturing (from China) with batteries included; however, item would not function with the included batteries nor with fresh bought batteries.  I asked for a refund and received it.  Thanks Amazon!"
"Great way to waste a few hours. You can make purchases in game or wait to level up, or earn them."
"works just as i expected it to. would recomend it to everyone. price was as i expected it to be"
"they are sheer, 100% see through in the picture they look thicker than what they are but i still used them"
"Awesome looks great just like the camera in restaurants set it up outside my house and now the neighborhood is peaceful"
"a little big but it's a nice shirt. fall on the body just as the picture showed. i ordered a medium instead of a small bc normally the clothes run small but this was runs true to size"
"Best mascara ever.  Have had many compliments and people ask me what kind of mascara I use.  Unfortunately, I can only get it online now as they have left the United States."
"Provides great protection, doesn't make the iPhone feel too bulky or big, lightweight rubber case.The only issue I found (and I mean the &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; part) was that at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, there is a line of rubber in between each of the speakers and the actual plug-in hole, making it very hard/uncomfortable to plug it in and practically impossible with some of the bigger cords (like the one I use in my car to charge it or connect it to the car's speakers). However, once I cut these off (any kind of small knife will do it, it doesn't need to be sharp at all) the case worked perfectly with any kind of charging/linking device and I am very satisfied with it."
"this is a fun app that anyone can use. its great for the kindle fire hd ! and its free you cant beat that"
"The ring fits easy...it's a nice little dress up ring..but you can tell it's kind of a cheap ring it's worth what you pay for it!"
"Wrong products.  Didn't feet to my car.  Too heavy to return the products.  I reordered break parts from Autozone.  No problem."
"This products is not polarized lens.  Too much difference with original.  Waste of money.  Never buy this products.  Disappointed with this products."
"Comfortable good looking shoe but too big. I'm so happy to have discovered Earth shoes! (I'm giving away as a birthday gift to friend.)"
"Just received a complimentary pen from Influenster  #univoxbox and I love it. It is lightweight and writes very smoothly. Great for note taking and signings."
"The picture makes this box look big but its very small couldn't hold half of the make up I have! I ended up giving mine to my little cousin. If you don't have much makeup this is for you but if you have a lot I would recommend you get something else."
"One of my favorite cases for my note. Its pretty fits my phone perfectly. Its light and not heavy. Come in good timing and its pink I love it!!!"
"I loveee these colors. I am a big fan of e.l.f. and these shadows are very noticeable. I would recommend this for all makeup lovers!"
"I got these in sliver and gold I love them both! The gold has not changed colors every time I wear them people compliment me on how pretty they are! And I love the pearl bracelet that's my favorite part of the set."
"I am processional painter/wood work finisher, this sander really does the work. It has unique sand paper changing mechanism that makes changing of sand paper very easy and effective Overall this sander is very easy to use.."
"I have been using this for about 3 months and it is holding up well. Some do not like the velcro vs. a magnetic closing mechanism, but I am happy with the product."
"I used it less than a month when one belt loop detached from the back of the case. This was not worth the trouble of ordering."
"I ordered this, focusing on the better review rather than the negative ones, and boy was I wrong to do so. I am very disappointed. The way the description was phrased, made it seem like it would work for both the DC and AC plugs, but upon arrival I realized that was not the case. Then, I had to wait three days for the converter to come. Finally, when I tried to use it, after 30 minutes it didn't even get a little warm. Also, the timer on it was extremely loud and obnoxious. I could hardly hear my TV. Can't even imagine trying to sleep with that clicking. All in all, do not buy this product, unless you just want a stiff camo blanket."
"I like the scent, it's a unique scent definatley an evening scent. It's a smell that is along the smells of the other Hugo boss...it's a good smell overall"
"I have had every cologne from armani code to drakkar and I have never had my girlfriend ask me to use it cause she liked the smell. It's a unique smell and definitely not for the truck driver type, or the conservative type, it's for the sporty, athletic type, someone unique willing to stand out...In a good way, it's definitely different, but ladies like it but don't use too much a spray or two will do."
"Of all the cases I have gotten all the reviews I read on this case, this case was the most disappointing. I didn't feel there was adequate protection with this case for the same price you could get a much more durable case, one that provides more defense against falls or drops. It's got two layers of the flimpsy rubber stuff. I might look cool and if that's what your looking for than this is your case, otherwise shop around go otterbox or a few others that's are just as awesome."
"The case is pretty good in my opinion its somewhat cool looking but like alot of the other cases it seems like it's better looking than it is for protection."
"It's a good all around case but i did not like the big plastic feel and look. It didn't feel like it would protect well against falls or drops...I mean it's plastic, but don't drop it and you will be fine."
"I enjoy it.  It is very informative on losts of subjects.All the LDS apps with Amazon are exceptionally good."
"Great case works well, the only problem you might have with it is that it can be hard to take off, once you put it on. But if you keep the pry tool it is not a problem. Kickstand feels a little flimsy, but I've had no problems with it(I open and shut it all day long). Also it comes in a lot of colors schemes"
"Item was as described and it Shipped pretty fast .  The only thing that could have been better would be the price. Other then that great product"
"sucks when you ahve to walk out to the front desk in a swimsuit and towel and ask for bolt-cutters because your lock won't open.  To be fair, it did last 4 months before it wouldn't open..bought it at Home Depot, and now searching for another lock."
"Very straight forward material. I took the test today and found it to be pretty representative of the things covered in the test."
"I love the game, but the cards are so small. They are kind of hard to see. That's my only complaint."
"This is a great book! I gave it this five rating because it gives a very in depth knowledge of the subject. I became aware of homeopathy a couple of years ago. After learning it a practice used by the Royal Family for hundreds of years, After reading excerpts from The Tuscany Express, I decided to also buy a book on this subject at the same time I bought Tuscany; this is the one I chose and I am very pleased with it."
"Ray Price went on to have hit after hit. Although I know of his older songs, and like Release Me (he was the first to make it a hit), and Crazy Arms, I was most impressed with the sixties songs he did like: Night Life and For The Good Times. Singers like Ray Price, and all the other greats of their times, didn't have to have all the flashing lights, and other distractions, to keep the attention on them; they stood alone, with just their voice and music.; that was all Ray Price needed to be at the top."
"Jackson should be a lesson for a lot of the new 'so called country signer'. I don't know where the others get the ideas we want to see the same ol' type of videos over and over; i.e. the four wheel trucks, the parties, the flashes of how many one second photos can we show, in one of the same type, of over and over videos Jackson has kept his 'cowboy' hat, and not reverted to the ball cap on backwards. It's good to have some of the 'real country' still left, like Alan Jackson."
"came as advertised, new in box ...  this is a good case does the trick for those wanting protection at low cost."
"Thinking that it would work.  It does not.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Was looking to hook up the HD and the cord is junk."

"I used this to clean my tiffany silver jewelries. I dipped the ring in, waited for couple seconds, and take it out. It shines like new!Before I bought it, I saw some reviews mentioning the strong smell of the solution. I agree with the strong odor. However, my jewelry did NOT smell anything after I take it out! So I think it's more important for the jewelries to not have any smell. five stars!"
"Interesting people and how they changeWith the times  is what intrigues me about this o.ne and only showSo unique and entertainingly educational.&amp;#128522;&amp;#128522;"
"Should have listened to one of the reviews. Shoe is just very largely made esp around the ankles. Your feet will slip through as it has no grips and the strip on top of foot is SUPER loose.Such a waste and a big regret."
"Just the right size. I am able to accomplish all of my tasks for school and work. Great support assistant."
"The sound and picture were everything I loved about the tv. Then after playing for 45 mins. the picture ect. went off and it will not work at all.  I charged it for hours and, it still will not come on.  I will be sending it backtho for a replacement."
"some of the covers on it for ports could be a little more durable, however the entire case feels and looks tough. I would...probably will order it again."
"Just because someone puts a &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; on the tag, doesn't make it a wide shoe. I wear a wide New Balance shoe, and have even had my foot measured at a New Balance store, so I know how this should fit. I love the look of the shoe, but unfortunately that doesn't help make it comfortable."
"This dictionary is not only fun to use,  but has great purpose. It certainly is not bulky.  LOL.  It is an e-book. It can be used anywhere.  Try it.  You  will like it."
"Order was received in excellent condition. It is an easy to read book. I learned new information. Really impressed with contents."

"One of the best series out, and some network idiot decided to cancel it, probably for something as idiotic as a depressed, underachieving mom trying to live out her fantasy thru her young daughter. Bring it back please!!!"
"The CRL Door Pressure Gauge performed perfectly.  It's well designed, compact and so simple to use anyone using it for the first time should have no problems figuring out how to use it.  The price was right and I'd recommend it to anyone who's trying to meet ADA compliance door pressure requirements."
"Device was good but the power cord was broken so I had to order a new one and a month later I still have not recieved it. waiting on deliverly.Lino Alcala"

"The Camera has great picture and it is a good starter kit. The stand broke immediately and is really cheap. I fixed it with duct tape but very annoying and I will have to buy another tripod."
"When she was younger, my daughter refused to sleep in deep cribs, so I bought the travel bed before I went oversee to visit family.The bed survives the travels well. Easy to fold and unfold, easy to carry and very comfortable. We took it to grandparents, to road trips, and sometimes just for living-room sleeping.Be warn, though - it is light weight, so when the baby starts crawling - it is time to store the bed for the next one. :-)Also: we always put it low - floor, carpet, mattresses - never where it might tip and fall."
"This water bottle is just perfect for my needs. I needed something quick, without a cap, you just squeeze it and ready to go!"
"I really like this cover, makes my ipod 4g look like a Iphone. Protects your ipod and really nice looking!"
"This capo is totally worth the money. Perfect for electric or acoustic guitars. meets all my needs, I'm really happy with it!"
"This Item was not what the seller had described at all!!!! They said it was flat and spiral steel boned but it is not!! the busk is the only thing that is steel and that is it other then that it is a regular plastic boned satin corset. I brought this item thinking it was what the seller described it as even though I saw I was not going to be able to return it. I am very disappointed with the order.  I would not recommend getting this unless it was like 15 dollars or less."
"This was such a cute outfit the jacket was adorable but the flower I was expecting to be on it was not there when it arrived. But I still love it. The shirt is cute. But the pants are not what they seem to be in the picture. I ordered for a 12 month old and the pants look like they should be for an 18 month almost 2 yr old. Other then the flower not being there and the jeans it's aborable"
"This game is great and has great movement for control. Great graphics, great challenges. Me and my daughter love this game."
"Very good...love John Grisham!!!! So riveting,couldn't put it down,wanted to read more,can't wait to buy his next book ...would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves John Grisham"

"Love it and the color makes it easier to separate my friends and mine. It is easy to clean and use."
"I liked this product because in my opinion I think anything is better than vista and that is what I upgraded from. I also enjoy the new start menu. But I dislike the different screens for apps."
"Best charger ever, cool blue light, works great for everyones android and flip phone, durable, cheap price. Recommend to all."
"On my last bag of the 4 pack, as far as i can say, they all taste great and burn great, not too much of a mess and no popping. Would definitely recommend."
"After a few months of use, i am finally writing a review for this battery. I still get around 2 days of life on this battery if im lightly using the phone. Heavy use (music and gaming) i get a full day. I must recommend this to everyone who has an electrify or photon, but batteries are like eggs, dont be surprised if you get a bad one."
"This is a decent cooler for its price but it could be so much better.1. Construction - As most other reviewers have stated, the construction is flimsy at best and heavy mobile use will eventually lead to an accident. Also the metal &amp;#34;incline&amp;#34; bar likes to pop out of slot sometimes wich is bad for the laptop. Also, the unit needs to be propped up on 4 &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; (i use small square wooden blocks at each corner&amp;#34; to actually get a decent airflow from the bottom.2. Fan - The fan is big, but it doesnt turn fast at all even at max. And it doesnt push that much air to your laptop. After a month of use, i can only get a 2 or 3 degree drop in CPU temperature and a 5 - 10 degree drop on VGA and HDD from this unit.3. Lighting - The red LED is nice and is the main reason i ordered this unit. I thought it would compliment my red backlit keyboard and red lights that i use to operate my computers in the dark. Well i was wrong. The LED is %100 invisible when you have a laptop sitting on the unit, and therefore is of no use at all.4. Size - This unit is advertised to fit 17&amp;#34; inch Laptops. Good luck getting a 15&amp;#34; inch to fit good on it. This unit is for Android Tablets and netbooks when it comes to size.5 - Conclusion - Do not buy! There has to be better products out there for the same price. If your set on a red LED laptop cooler, forget it because very very few Cooler LED's are visible once a laptop is sat on them. Thermaltake kicks ass just not at Laptop Coolers yet."
"I was very excited when i forst got this coat. It looks very good and is very comfortable. Then i found out one of the pocket buttons was mis-aligned when it was pressed onto the jacket, and there is no way to fix it due to the broke off piece being stitched inside the lining if the pocket. Also, after 2 weeks of light - moderate use, this coat is already falling apart. Threads are coming loose all over the jacket, and i will haft to get my Gma to fix some of the inner-liner buttons that were very poorly stitched on with loose threads. I would not recommend this coat to anyone. Ive heard so much about Rothco. Well i tell ya, my experience with them sucks so far. Stay away from this coat no matter how cool it looks."
"Thank you. I love it. It is a little big but it is ok. When you have any special let me know please"
"I would like to let you know I love it.  Everythinf is perfect this is the camara I was loocking for. Thank you"

"The sound is real great. On par wit the big name headphone companies.  Only drawback is it tends the to disconnect from my phone at the gym"
"This was the perfect replacement of the adaptor that came with the computer...and it was $35.00 cheaper than the one at the Sony store."
"These boots are wonderful.  At 3 degrees F.  my feet were not the least bit cold.  I would recommend these boots to anyone.  Good Buy!!!"
"Product arrived in a timely manner and in great condition.  I am very happy with the clamps. I use them in conjunction with a green screen and they work perfectly."
"Product arrived in a timely manner in good condition.  Unfortunately for Me, I bought this thinking it would work with My blue yeti microphone, but alas no.  The shock mount is for a normal skinny type mic and the mounting thread is a non standard size so I could not put My yeti shock mount onto this arm.  At some point in the future I may get a mic that will fit this for use, but for the time being its not in the cards.  Good product tho.  I did set it up on the desk and it would have filled the bill perfectly if only the fitting would have supported putting My mic on it."
"Pros: Comfortable, slim and small enough to be carry with my laptop, the trackpoint, is to me the best pointing solution today, it's the only that prevents the hand move away the keyboard. The typing experience is very good, and smooth.Cons: Until now the only cons I've found is that the enter key is a bit small and the missing numeric keypad, be aware for some people the palm rest could be uncomfortable.I'd recommend this keyboard to all that spend more than 5 to 7 hours a day using the computer keyboard, is more fast and comfortable that others.Previously I'd bought a Motorola Keyboard, that's also came with a sort of pointing stick, but the lack of the scroll button, makes this keyboard the winner.Hope you find this review informative to you."
"The cinnamon is super strong, which I guess I should have expected. It wasn't bad but not as good as the other types I tried."
"Just for some information, I am 23 years old, 5'1"" tall, and started at 132 pounds as my heaviest weight. I was at the borderline BMI of Normal and Overweight, and decided to do something about it. I started dieting and exercising, but only saw small results. :( So I tried adding this garcinia cambogia. I've been using this product for 2 weeks now, and I have lost a total of 8 pounds with my diet and exercise routine!!! :D I've noticed a major difference in my energy and appetite. My clothes even fit so much better than before.I got my mom to try this as well. She's very ANTI-EXERCISE. :)) But she started eating healthier, and she has lost 6 pounds so far. :)Another thing I love is that NatureWise has great customer service! :DI'm also recommending this to my  other relatives and friends! I'll continue to use this product!"
"Not sure why other people don't like these, The brushes arrived in perfect condition,I received this package in the mail, the brush set is not professional quality, but It is great for me, because I practiced nail art on my own nails, make beautiful lines The handles are made of hard plastic, the only thing is the brushes that i purchased are not the same as the picture."
"""I love this product, I love the colors,They arrived nicely wrapped, and great price and free shipping, and one of the color was out of stock and they included another neon color, and in my next order the seller its going to include the missing color at not cost, and this is very nice, and this package does not take to long to arrive to my home, this polish nail are perfect for my nail art designs."""
"I liked the brushes, I am very happy with purchase, The brushes were in good condition, free shipping, and arrived early that the Delivery Estimate, these lovely brushes are excellent for my nail art designs."
"I bought this lamp for my acrylic work, I'm super happy because the price was very good, with free delivery, all you pay a tax, but I get ahead of schedule, very well packed, and in good condition, I look elsewhere and had it for a higher price, dries fast, and I like that does not occupy much space and has a fairly long power cord, my friends liked it, I highly recommend it, the transaction was clear and very fast, and they sent me an email notifying me the update, and hope to make another purchase in the future with the seller."
"I ordered these brushes because I didn't want to spend a fortune on an acrylic brush,good price, The brushes came  very fast it came before the set date, Brush Size: #4, #6, #8, #10, #12, It is safe and easily to be used, ready to try them out in a few days, only i got one brush that is not the same like the others, colorful handles makes it fun to work with them, but at the end, i'm happy with my order."
"usually i wouldn't spend this much on tweezers but I think this is an awesome brand,I absolutely love this pair of tweezers, They are great because i can get the perfect size of rhinestone, I am glad I bought them, excellent goods, these tweezers came in fast delivery, Packing good, Great tool &amp; very easy to use,  I would recommend this to a friend, Thanks!"

Thank you!."
"The item was received exactly as specified and the price was good,The colors are great and there are 12 colors with no duplicates.  Brand New, Easy to apply on natural or artificial nails, this are perfect for my nail art, the most important thing is the case, because the case works fine, and i can keep all my Rhinestones in order, I recommend  this product."
"The suit was extremely cute! But unfortunately the pants were too long for the baby. You guys should consider shortening the length of the pants considering most babies dont have long legs like that."
"Bought this for my fiance's Jeep - He couldnt be happier! He loves the light bar. Extremely bright and very nice quality.thanks again!"
"It's cute but It doesn't fit properly I feel like If I want to take it off it might break"
"I ordered this case 3 days ago from amazon, the shipping and handling was very fast. When I got my phone case it was broken on the one side and didn't fit properly on my phone. The description of the phone case is HARD CLEAR case and I did not get that at all. I got a cheap piece of plastic that you could fold together. The back of this phone case was also blurry. False advertisement on this product."
"Great price. Product really works!!! Great for camping or prepping. It also has a hole for ur keychain which is pretty cool."
"Fantastic  full tang very sharp and well put together. Lightweight a must have for camping or survival .durable and grip is awesome"
"Good for my little son than I expected.Fit well He feels so comfortable and satisfied. I'm also happy that."
"It's not worth the aggregation!! I have a LG Cosmos. It fit's around your phone but you have to take it off to use your phone. It covers up all the function control buttons such as the volume, unlock, messaging, changing between characters/symbols, optional. It also interferes with sliding your phone opening to use the keyboard. I did contact Electromaster - stated it was meant for the LG Cosmo 2 phones. They were not very helpful and told me I needed to e-mail someone else. THERE IS A GOOD REASON ""WHY IT WAS SUCH A LOW PRICE!!!""  I will be sure to contact AMAZON to help me deal with this issue. I will probably need to throw this away cause it might damage the phone. If the seller doesn't seem to take care of the problem. Do your research before you buy. If it really cheap, there is a reason behind why!!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026PV6RI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
"I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. It exceeded my expectations with the quality and the size!It arrived when it was suppose to and I Very much would recommend this product!"
"Super useful when I'm on-the-go! Android battery isn't that great so it's helpful. Charges iPads great too. Gona take it with me when I go camping."
"THIS BOOK IS Awesome! It's so interesting, made me wanna read it over again. Heh, I'm reading the next series now"
"Fragrance to use day by dayI recomend for women whose don't like anything strongIt keeps for a long time"
"The keyboard arrived when expected. The keyboard while smaller is really convenient when writing long letters and such. The case itself is durable and will definitely protect the tablet. Even though the cord  seems to be OK I'm concerned long term if it will last."
"I like this product. Is inexpensive and excelent. Is in good condition and the funtion is very very good. Thanks!"
"This book is incredible I love love love it can wait for the next one diamond McKinney can I just say no homo but I love you lol"
"I liked the movie and it showed how to people who are different can find love.and the story line was great but the sister in law could have had a heart"
"this was  a wonderful  movie it had taste, beauty,it was a pleasure waiting to see it for three month.you know the old saying that goes it was well worth the waite. the best to a perfect ending. great acting by both women"
"From the first time I opened them, I am extremely blown away by these headphones. My only warning is that your ears are VERY prone to get hot while exercising wearing these and it's easy for people around you to hear. The bass is powerful and the on-ear style is very comfy. This is the perfect companion to listen to anything anywhere, just not while active."
"Very good product. Much better than the Santa Medical one we purchased first and had to throw out because it gobbled up batteries. The Nonin has same battery now for over 6 weeks. Accuracy matches the professional units used by the nurses at rehab center. Thinking of buying another one for another member of the family. Do not hesitate because of price - it is clearly the best on the market."
"Disappointed with battery life. A set of batteries lasts less than 2 days. Apparently auto-shutoff does not stop current flow. Accuracy is good. However could not use it at rehab center as batteries were always dead. Cannot recommend."
"This ring is so cute and was shipped quickly. Love love love it. I am very pleased with this purchase!"
"My granddaughter, 12, has been doing nails for a while, and has always had trouble finding small brushes to draw designs on with. The brushes for these polishes are a perfect fine tip, and the colors can't be found anywhere else.LOVE IT!"
"It's been awhile since I read it, so I cannot recall specifics.  I just recall that I didn't like it."
"I got the RHCSA certification because of this book, I really like it and recommend it for those RH certification seekers.."
"It was better than I expected.The person I gave it to saw one in a store and was glad to receive it."
"All the reviews say that the top line of the cover is off, and they are correct! However, if you can get over that, the color is awesome. I couldn't get over that though...blame it on the OCD tendencies."
"these are great headphones. i bought 3 so far for my family and everyone loves them. price is great. thanks"
"Satisfecho con la compra, llegaron en excelente condici&amp;oacute;n a venezuela encendieron perfectamente y todas sus funciones est&amp;aacute;n activas y la c&amp;aacute;mara muy buena , satisfecho."
"Not sure if the keyboard works or not, like so many other reviewers, because there was NO directions telling us that we would need an adapter.  The picture is misleading because it shows the adapter with the connection.  In fact, it says to plug the connection right into the tablet.  Now I have to go get one, not a big deal if I had just known specifically that I need to order one at the same time."
"my girlfriend loved this neckless. i wair it all the time. and so dose she. i have been wairing it for about 5 monts and it has no scraches or anything. i would say the only thing that i dont like is that the girls chain, the clip on it comes undone sometimes if its pulled on or something. but you only have to bend it back alittle. then everything works perfictly again."
"I bought this because I liked the movie better than the first one, even though I think the original is also a great movie. Little Lady actually does good at continuing from the first movie unlike some where some of the details don't make sense between original and sequel. This movie is worth buying just for the parts of Ted Danson pretending to be a minister."
"Dean Cain is a great pick for Super/ Kent. He fits the character of clean-cut, goody-good, do everything the right way. Terri Hatcher is a knockout, plus her character has a lot of fire and spunk which is sometimes lacking from other Lois Lanes. Of course, Lois manages to get into many situations requiring her rescue.  John Shea is awesome as Lex Luthor. One other part of the series I like is the fact that in this show Clark's  earth father is still alive."
"Well written and insightful. Well worth my time and a a very appreciated new view on a not often explored topic. I hope that there is a follow up to this story and that by sharing her story new in roads to the science of eye disease will be made."
"We just received these are beginning to track my cycle, however I have to give them a decent rating as I am not knocked up. Will update next month."
"Nice thick tape, never hade a problem with this brand breaking or peeling. Dispenser is very easy to use. This is not the cheapest packing tape, but you get what you pay for and this does the job."
"Used a lot stupid and other insults. I had such fond memories of Charlie Brown, but found myself cringing when watching this with my two little boys. Would not recommend."
"They fit perfectly. Have a very Nice tight seal. Was a very good deal, especially with free ship. Would recommend."
"Very lightweight, perfect size for 4 or 5 year oldIt floats, that is great for any age.Cast action is simple and very easy to useThe spool is a good size to limit overrides, does not jam in the spool, like most reelsPractice plug is a great feature.Has a penguin or two, but not obnoxious, like most of the children's rods that are covered with characters. Once this is out of the packaging, looks like a nice blue and white fishing rod."
"they are amazing, good sound, very comfortable and the cord is pretty long which makes is more portable. also good price"
"steps were fast..and direction..also music was not what i expected? It is good for experienced Zumba dancers workout,but someone who is starting needs warm up and simple direction before steps-squats- ect...I got it as a start,but will try someone else."
"I liked this soap, lathers well, smells good, and feels refreshing scent. The only issue was it took a couple weeks to receive, but worth the wait!"
"I like this professional CD player, user freindly and looks great.. we have a lot of fun with it...no regrets here,so far!"
"Like this- great taste-easy on stomach and decent value/cost for this good tea- helps over-all.will  order another bag- does what advertised to help do."
"I bought this stick was in a pinch and on a budget,i honestly am not all that pleased with the button lay out the HAT switch is off set and at least for me feels awkward.The stick is very comfortable very nice grip feel.The buttons on the base a virtually flush with the surface of the base and that means you have to look down to find them taking your eyes off the screen,anyone who flys  combat simulation knows thats NOT ideal."
"These are possibly the best shoes I've ever owned. Because they're leather, and not vinyl, they don't stick up my closet and they allow enough air in to keep nasty foot odor from occurring. Plus, they're just plain beautiful!"
"I don't do this every day but am definitely noticing some tightening in my abs and my shoulders feel really strong. This is an intense set of moves and you do it twice through, faster the second time. I have done a couple of her other videos but this one and the kickboxing one are my favorites."
"I love these lashes. The price was right!! It works great and I saved so much money compared to different brands. I plan on buying more."
"Predictable but enjoyable. I thought it was a bit rushed at the end. Some of the issues were not explored and sort of left hanging. Maybe they get resolved in the third book."
"The phone is already starting to have problems.  Sometimes when I text it turns itself off unexpectedly which is not good and I can only use it on speaker phone now because the outside earpiece isn't working anymore."
"the movie does not play in american made dvd players.  i wished i had known that before i ordered it."
"A friend of mine asked me to make her Elfie a skirt and when I went online to find a pattern, I found this instead.  It was easier and less expensive to buy this one and she LOVED it!"
"very bad product, broken wine. I did not like. I want my money reinstated. I found a steal. sorry so bad"
"Medium bold flavor is ideal for my second or third cup of the day.Also makes a lighter version when iced."
"I am pleased with the overall product. The only problem i ran into was that after useing a heat gun on the strips,they wouldnt stick to the leather on my steering wheel like shown in the picture which is what i wanted most out of it. otherwise the product worked great around my stereo and shift nob which is made of some sort of plastic"
"Loved by kids and adults. Loads of fun. Just remember to use diet soda, much less sticky than regular soda."
"I got this primarily to wear under my shirt, to carry my CCL and a CCL badge my kids got me. Unfortunately it doesn't fold flat, and bulges way too much under my shirt to be any use. You can only really wear this on the outside."
"Fat Chicks Rule and Fat!So? changed my life - saved it even. I was suicidal when I went looking for something and found these, I'm fat and now I know that eating healthy and exercising for fun are all I need, not the BS advertising companies have bribed the health industry and brainwashed stupid Joe Blow into telling me. Marilyn Wann rocks!!!"
"The white cover got dirty too quick it lasted me two days and too expensive for how long it lasted!"
"So far I'm liking it but if I have to pay for every new episode I know it will be a short lived game for me because it took 3 hours to load what seems to be just one episode."
"I have returned this item three times and everytime I get it there is something wrong with the box or something is cracked and this last time the box was bent but I'm keeping it because I'm sick of having to send it back and wait. It's not the post office it's factory flaws."
"I like the smell, made my car smell better than it did before lol I plan on ordering more of this item.  Great order !"
"I love this tripod. I have been wanting this for doing videos with my tablet as well as my digital camera. You can use any camera on this tripod. It has all kinds of great features."
"I didn't like the what this app has. I was looking for an app I can do all kinds of different editing."
"I just started using this product. I really hope it Will work bcus I have something called Hormonal Acne and I've tried everything. Nothing works, I've heard good things about this product. ..it's really cheap at Costco if I may say so.I'm trying it out."
"Garcinia Cambogia extract pure max 3000mg this product didn't work for me, didn't lost weight, is expensive and don't do anything, so bad, don't like me."
"the tiller did what I hoped it would do its  easy to work around your plants in the garden and for the price its worth the money."
"Good quality shirt. Sizes do run small so thankfully I read the reviews before hand and ordered a larger size. Fits great!"
"Quality is great for the price; better than I expected! Bought it for my 6 year old son size small and it is a little big. It would fit a 7-8 year old perfectly."
"Does not stay in controller falls out constantly the batteries are hard to remove from the battery pack and you can tell the difference from a normal battery pack"
"The analog sticks don't move well when you install them, they stick when you move them they don't return to proper position after you move them on the contorller"
"Very happy with these hooks. They're easy to install, and will hold a considerable amount of weight. Plus they're pretty!"
"My grandmother gave me this book while I was on bed rest when I was pregnant with my son. and I have to say John saul book ""The Right hand of evil"" kept me enterained. It was my first book of his that i've read and I absolutely loved reading it. I am now reading ""When the wind blows"" and love that book as well. If you are considering reading this book I promise you wont be dissapointed."
"I have got this product which is too large. Now they are saying it to give it someone else and they will refund only 80%. Isn't it pathetic.. What a smart way to sell the product. I am going nuts with this as it has screwed my all the plans."
"Good!!"
"I love my ring. it came so quickly too. i had one like it when i was younger and had lost it over the years, and until now hadnt seen a replacement. i was totally thriled to get this at that price! thank you! i would recommend you to anyone who wants fine silver and quickly."
"This book is a daily challenge to commitment and love for your spouse. It is very practical and essential in our hectic lifestyles to be reminded of the simple principles that enrich our marriages."
"Bought this for my daughter and she could not put it down. In one day she produced two beautiful zentangle  designs and easily picked up the technique. She is hooked and is excited to learn more."
"I bought this for my daughter who is beginning to learn zentangle along with an instructional book .I like how everything she draws will be in this book and not have loose papers everywhere."
"They can be worn anywhere,so fun!No fear of mud in these high tread shoes. So easy to put on and take off yet snug when worn.I can't garden without them."
"When you own roses you are always replacing your gloves. These are great in the war of not getting stuck by thorns."
"The joy of precision drawing tools,these make me happy.I can get beautiful results while drawing with this set. The variety is great for unique effects."
"I take this every day and definitely helps with my digestion. It should not be used to lose weight it's mostly to help you with the constipation."
"The T-Core is an amazing way to add bulk to your abdominals since it is a resistance weighted piece of equipment.  You will not get amazing abs using this alone, unless you do at least like 3 different exercises till failure using little to no resistance to burn fat.  It is a good thing to add to your already existing ab workout!  However, this requires the activation of your core, which I'm sure most people are not understanding when buying this.  What I mean is; form is key in using this.  Most people will just lean forward and back or use their arms to pull the T-Core down and up.  That is completely wrong and why I believe anyone who has put a bad review down has done.  You need to only move your core and abs, nothing else.  It's much like a cable crunch or normal crunch.  Bend your core and abs, they should be doing all the work."
"This product is by far the most amazing capture card ever made in my opinion.  It is so easy to get started, record, and finalize a clip before saving it into a file.  No hassles or inconveniences, just 100% perfect.  Works great with Mac and I know it works with PC as well.  Records beautiful 1080p HD on my Xbox360 and the program for it is so simple and user friendly, this is truly a gift to the gaming community.  If you aren't satisfied with my review, check out my YouTube video on the out of box testing using Halo 4!Search: RicherFilmz on YouTube!!!Titled: elgato Game Capture HD - Halo 4 Style"
"I love this product! Yes the sizes are strange but if you can find a size that fits its great to use. I started using one on my redbone coonhound and it worked perfectly and he liked it better because it didn't have the strap over his muzzle. So when my boston terrier started getting a luxating patella her pulling all the time didn't help. I didn't want to use the normal gentle leader on her because bostons tend to have eye problems and the strap would cause more pressure on her eyes. Today I received her harness and its such a joy to walk her now. she's only 20lb but all muscle with the harness she is no longer dragging me around. This product is worth every penny."

"This cat toy is perfect for my cat! He obsesses on it unlike any other toy he has ever had. Because he has been so enthusiastic about it, he has annihilated the feathers- good thing you can buy replacements!"

"If you love stories about dragons, and protectors you will love this story. Her tattoo of a dragon becomes her protector. Ronnie falls in love with Liam, and Liam falls in love with her but is it possible for them to have a relationship? It is a story based on personal experiences. It may be short but it is full of details and keeps you interested.I hope the author does a second part. Maybe we will find out if there is a way for Ronnie and Liam to have a relationship."
"The lights were not very bright other than that they are ok I really liked the blue lights that were ordered now they are noticeable"
"I've been looking for a case like this and it's perfect. I even love the color. This is a great case."

"A friend of mine urged me to download this book onto my Kindle/tablet, going on and on about how the Elizabeth series is so good. I read it just to get her off my back when I spoke with her next. Reluctantly, I sat down on my lunch hour and read it cover to cover, loosing track of all space and time. I was completely and utterly converted to this author and this series. Vivid imagery and a plotline which draws the reader in from the first paragraph through to the very last word--a quick and satisfying read. I could not wait to get the box set with the whole series so that I can find out what happens next. I am hooked! A fun and exciting breathe of fresh air!"
"Its so awesome"

"Finally a coffee that doesn't keep me awake!  I'm a coffee lover and couldn't have coffee past 3pm if I wanted to fall asleep that night.  I can't tell you how thankful I am that someone out there finally came out with this coffee!!  And it tastes lovely!  I wish it was around 10 years ago!"
"The quality seems pretty good. I ordered two of these for my sons outdoor birthday party to make it easier which it did come in handy so the wind didn't blow the roll. As far as making it easier to pull the paper towel off with one hand I'm not so sure about. At first it seemed to work pretty well. But overall I'm satisfied with them and use them a lot over the summer outside for our cookouts."
"Putting it together was easy but the quality isn't that great. I thought I would really like the double bar but without having it sideways you really can't see the clothes on the back row. The bars are adjustable so I have the front bar all the way down and the back bar up high so I can have it against the wall. I ended up having a closet built so I use this rack at our Pawn Shop and seems to work well there."
"I have really enjoyed playing this game; however, it keeps crashing on me! In between levels or at the end of levels (not usually in the middle of one) it shuts off and goes back to my home screen. Not the worst thing ever but still frustrating. The game itself is very entertaining and engaging."
"Got the item sooner than expected. I custom paint controllers and this was a must and works like a charm."
"You have to have an odd sense of humor to get it but overall it's a great book. Define recommend"

"I'ma tech fan , so anything I buy that has todo with him I love. Great live concert. never bought a video like this , but if you want to see a great live concert in the comfort of your home an your a tech fan than this is a must have for you. Well put together."
"We bought this mat for my daughter in cheerleading. She uses it to practice her tumbling. It is plenty thick, but still easy to store. Personally I wish it was denser but this would mean it would be heavier. It is a nice entry level mat that works great for what we wanted."
"This necklace is okay I guess. I was hoping for something that looked a little classier. I would say it is fine for someone under 8."
"these earrings are okay I guess. I was hoping for something that looked a little classier. I would say they are fine for someone under 8."
"This is a very cute song that brought back a lot of memories. I got it for my daughter and she loves it. be careful though it can get stuck in your head."
"I chose 5 stars because of the way the SD cards are secured. The construction of this unit will keep the dust and dirt away from the contacts on the cards. I like this product over others for the compactness and the ability to hold more than 1 card at a time."
"The Nerf Triple Armor lives up to it's name. I gave it 5 stars because it is just like a suit of armour for your DS. My daughter has dropped hers several times with no damage. This is the second case and second DS we have bought her. The first one broke (both the case and the DS) that we have bought her. It is a little more bulky than a normal case but cushions the DS well. It was easy to install and works for several different models. In closing this case is an excellent investment towards keeping your DS safe from damage caused by a drop, and I would recommend it for everyone."
"This is a very good coffee. It is strong enough that you get a nice flavor without it being bitter. It is very smooth. I must admit that I like Emerill's a little better, but for the price it can't be beat. I have recommended it to my father in-law, and he likes it as well."
"Right from the start, the CD Player never worked. We tried it with a number of CDs.But it did not work. We are unable to use it."
"Very bad: the problem of this book is that it does contain a lot of symbols in formulas, and many times it doesn't explain their meaning. If there wasn't this problem it was worth 5 stars, but imagine a reader trying to guess what all these symbols mean(for example in Ward shading model). Writing a shader knowing what the symbols mean could be done in 10 minutes, but it takes even a week if you don't know what symbols mean. I guess how can the author think that we magically know what he means with all these symbols, how asinine."
"The sharps worked great with  me truedraw pen and I will absolutely order them again. I like the fact that they come with a cap."
"Glad I shopped here....and will shop here again. These strips are the same brand I started with when I first began testing back in October."
"Called anker they said it would fit my phone read them serial number and everything. Battery is way to big."

"Good book until page 47. The author begins to assume that you know more than he has already taught you. I would recommend this book as there is some educational value."
"I got everything that was said in the description and it is very useful and it protects my phone very well."
"Loved it online &amp; love it even more in person!!! I've gotten so many compliments on it! It's bigger than the armitron I previously had but I love it! Change it great! So satisfied with my purchase!!!!"
"this is really nice case for google nexus 7...comfortable easy to handle n with cute stylus penmaterial of cover is quite good ... 9.5/10"
"yep, as other have said... this saw rocks!  true steel blade that is razor sharp... easy tensioning nut... and the saw is HUGE!  lovelovelove it!"
"Great price on these stamps... they came in a nice box with marked holes. They have worked well stamping keys."
"It does what it says it does, it burns incense sticks n cones... when placing stick incense in base, you need to make sure the top is centered over cup for the cones.. simple enough.. its taller than I expected too, maybe 15&amp;#34;"
"I picked up two of these cases, one was a gift and the other for a AR-15 with all the bells.. fits perfectly and the blood red velvet like  inside gently cradles your weapon.  tag says it floats too! tho I cant see how with a serious weapon. both are embroidered with  Zombie Hunter.. looks nice."
"WOW, for the low price I was hesitant to order these but im glad I did... they work and print perfectly. Will buy again!"
"Love it"
"Excellent great results"
"its so cute!  Can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss.  This book keeps baby's attention... who knows maybe will help her learn her ABCs"
"perfect for storing those baby keepsakes, hospital bracelets, etc.  I loved mine so much that I got one for a friend, too."
"Our child did NOT want the commercial vitamin dropper we were trying to use.  She'd spit it out, throw it up, and get upset.  Using just one drop on the feeding surface is so much easier, and less stressful for all involved.  She doesn't even know she is getting her vitamin!"
"I understand that while pregnant, I'm not supposed to be doing the same things as I had been doing pre-pregnancy.... but.... I'm pretty disappointed in this series.  I purchased these DVDs because I love yoga and have been doing it 2-3 times a week for the last few years.  The yoga DVD was extremely disappointing.  I guess it would be okay for someone who is accustomed to a level 1 beginners yoga, but for those of us who like at least a little bit of a challenge (and to get at least a little sweat on!) this sequence  has nothing to offer.  I also tried the pilates and strength training... not impressed with those, either.  I could see these being good for someone used to a lower level of working out, but for those of us who appreciate even a minimum amount of challenge, this series is not a good fit!!!"
"but the pin that it came with has rhinestones on it.  The dress got snagged on the pin and pulled a bit.  This dress is PERFECT for your pregnant body if you  are going somewhere HOT, like an outdoor wedding.  Otherwise you will definitely want a slip or something underneath.  Its nearly sheer but not quite."
"I guess you get what you pay for.  These are thin, poor quality and made in China.  Disappointing, Gerber, very disappointing."
"the fabric is very, very thin on these and might have been perfect for summer.  seems pretty cheap and poorly made."
"I have had so much trouble finding a case (that's not black) for my tab 2. This fits perfect and even the screen protector does to. Nice quality for an $8 case. Fits inside my tab sleeve for ten inches with the case cover."
"I love Gypsy. Have since the first time I heard them. I happy they are still playing great at always !!!"
"This product worked like it was supposed to.  I will definitely use more of these in the future.  Thanks again."
"I bought this board for my sister as a gift, and I wasn't expecting such quality. The board was so nice I used it more than her while I was visiting."
"Great Study Which we will use After finish Revelation the ladies have been great studentsand have received great blessing from study"
"Keeps the baby food at a nice temperature for the baby to eat, I don't like using a microwave to heat food and this warms it just enough for her to eat, love it!"
"This book was  helped me master what I thought was an extremely complicated machine,new project ideas,additional information very helpful,thank you"
"I really liked this book, it went from family to family and kept you wanting to not put the book down, it was full of suspense wondering what would happen next."
"I have been doing word search all my life,  I doubt after all this time that I will ever tire of doing them"
"Not a lot of good stories this month  but maybe there is something wrong with me..  I will try it again"
"Very nice dress very bright and assure that I will be ordering again I were quite a few thank you"
"She really liked it made it feel like a big girl she's only three I'll buy again thank you soon"
"Speedy service! I bought theis when I worked in residential care for misguided youth. I used this as a tool to teach classes and it was something that they found very relatable. I now work in the community with many of the same youth and still use this as a tool or just something to show them. Thanks for being so quick on delivery as well! I recommend this movie/book to any and all who work with youth!"
"I bought this to carry with me because I have to carry an iPad, planner, and a few other miscellaeous things from my office to my client's homes, schools, etc. This works perfect! It is durable and just big enough to carry a lunch box in as well if one likes to eat in at the office. The service was faster than expected as well! I will continue to do business with this company! Thank you!"
"No, the book does not include the access code. You have to purchase one from MyITLab. Mine was 88 bucks. It's still a pretty good price for the book itself though. If you take a course that requires this book then I think you'll like it. It's written to where it's easy to read, there's tons of interesting things to break the monotony of just reading. From what I've seen, none of it's hard to understand."
"I've read every single one of David Dalglish's novels and short-stories to date, and with every single one I find something new and exciting. While this is a re-publish of his earlier books, it's an updated, upgraded version. The story now has a lot more depth and consistency, and over all is just better quality than the previous ones. Which isn't to say the others were bad, they were great, just that this is an improvement ;) If you've read the other books before these, read these. They're somewhat pricey for a kindle novel, but it's worth every single penny. Just so you know, I'm not just a Dalglish fanboy, I only support author whom I believe have talent and skill, both of which and more Dalglish has."
"As posted by reviewers before me, the book is kind of a run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. It's good, not great. It's fun to read at times, but at others it's a little painful. I would recommend it because it's free, if it weren't I wouldn't waste more than a few dollars on it. I don't know how the books after this in the series play out, but I plan on getting the next one to see how it plays out. The book has potential, now all that's left to do is see if the author acts on it. (If the author had a better editor the book could have been amazing, just sayin')"
"I picked up the book from my school library, and I immediately noticed that the environment posed to the reader by Barron is amazing, and you immediately find yourself immersed in the book. I did not entirely enjoy the book, as it was not really fitting of some of my own preferences, but I can't bring down any stars solely for my personal preference. The book is smooth, (a little slow at a couple of times), innocent, and, in a sense, refreshing. The writing is simple and easy to follow. I can see younger readers finding it many times more enjoyable than I did, and I highly recommend it to anybody within the recommended age group."
"I felt like the book started very well, albeit, lacking in some detail, and the writing seemed a little too simplistic and not well thought out. I enjoyed reading it, but I feel like it took a nosedive towards the end. I won't be buying the rest of the books in the series, maybe the next one, to see if the ending is made up for, but since it's free and you have absolutely nothing better to do whatsoever, go for it. See for yourself. Don't recommend it if you have another thing to read, it'd be a waste of time, but if you're still curious, go for it. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars."
"I finished 2BR02B in one sitting, and I enjoyed quite a bit of it. The concept was good, the story was O.K., and it ended just as quickly as it starts. I won't spoil any of the book for you, but I recommend it to anyone with nothing better to do."
"I came into the book expecting it to be great, and I was surprised that it exceeded even my own inflated expectations. I've read many of Jules Verne's works, and I can sat that I was thoroughly amused the whole time I was reading this book. I've come to the realization that very few writers today even come close to the marvelous works that were wrought by hands such as Jules Verne. Would I recommend it? YES! If you enjoy a little bit of Sci-Fi, a lot of adventure, some laughs, and some good time well spent you'll love reading Jules Verne's &amp;#34;The Mysterious Island&amp;#34;."
"If you plan on, or are reading the Godsland Series, I would highly recommend this to you. There's no point in not reading it, it's free, and definitely not a waste of time. I think it took me about 20 minutes to read it. If you're gonna read the series, read it, if not, there's no point :P"
"If you were kind of feeling a little iffy about the character of Thren Felhorn, (Haern's father) and why he was so ruthless and kind of &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, this'll clear it right up, it's short, easy to read, and memorable. Dalglish managed to pack a lot of awesome into a little novella. Worth the time and money for any fan of Dalglish, (especially) or just someone looking for a good way to pass a little time."
"Not quitevas good as the first book but was well worth the read.  You can't help but love Nathan and Harv what what they do.  Adventureous and exciting.  Bea"
"Jeff is fantastic as usual.  Peanut and Walter were at their best!  If you want some laughs view this video.  B"
"My dog love the mini snacks.  Could not find them at my local Walmarts of any other store since Christmas and was lucky too find them on line.  You have made my Su-Ling very happy.  Awesome product!!  Bea"

"Five stars  Enjoy greatly. The 3D bowling game is fantastic My sister had it on her Kindle and I became hooked. Had to download on mine"
"Great case very slim.  I got the turquoise mint very bright color not quite like the picture but il like it just the same.  It for have sparkles so I would not recommend this for men."
"The case fits great and stands up to drops and falls. I like the PU feel, slides great in and out of your pocket or purse and doesn't catch all the lint the rubber cases get. Does not stretch out over time either. Great buy and great price."
"Very sturdy. It has stopped to pretty bad scratches from happening and still looks brand new. I will always purchase one of these for any phone I own. The fit is good, it covers the screen well."
"I have used other wet application screen protectors and this was the easiest. Great fit on the phone and I feel confident it will protect my phone for as long as I own it."
"This pencil is absolutely amazing. It has amazing grip, amazing flow, an amazing eraser, and good build quality. For 15 bucks, this pack is more than worth your money. Each pencil also includes some spare lead."
"I absolutely adore this laptop. Its design competes with, if not outright beats that of the Apple Macbook Air. My only wish is that the keyboard had more key travel."
"I'm so pleased with this necklace! It's more then I expected. Totally a awesome buy! The stone has so much sparkle and fire. Every times wear it I have people telling me how pretty it is! I totally recommend this necklace. Great but!"
"Omg the cell case is just beautiful! Received in a timely matter no stones missing and high quality! I'm very pleased with my purchase"
"I liked this book very much, it exsplains a lot about the life of a boy who is grown now. but reallycannot give up his dark interself he is deeply  unsure of who he is."
"i  belive this book is all about the true what is going on in our world to day. the Lord is on his way."
"this book is very  true and  scary if you are not a christian. our world is in a big mess this writer  seams to know his bible well .i read all his books."
"Theses a so cute on the arm. They keep there shine and everything... Great and Love Them to much.... Great Produce"
"From  20 feet  the  reception is  bad do not use  them.Wish I  had not purchased just  do not want to pay to send them back.Mark"
"We had a problem with the connections at first but we were sent the proper fittings and now it works great.  Thank you"
"Worked great! Great gloss and sheen. Used this product after using the Buff Magic compound. Very happy with the outcome!"
"I honestly could not put this one down. Well written and enthralling. A brilliant re-imagining of the roles played by characters formerly well known. My only issue with the story is that I have reached the end of this tale. I long to read more of this Robin's life. If I can find a continuation of this tale I will certainly buy it."
"I saw this book in a local store, but thought it was too expensive since I was only really interested in one pattern.  Late I found it on sale at Amazon and ordered it.  I've made the preferred socks and I'm well pleased."
"Works great with iPhone 5s!! Don't have to get tangled up In headset wires any longer!!!!! Awesome for workouts! Highly recommend!"
"I loved the love story!  The crazy guys in it and the women that love them-oh yeah and the women are crazy too-even better!!"
"I am intrigued to see what happens next.  What's in the cards for them and who,is,this Q!?If you like suspense and love story this is a good one for you!"
"I loved the story, but hate the cliff hangers!!  Wish I didn't  have to wait so long till the next one"
"The book was extremely good and interesting especially when Truett came back begging for Norahs love. Thank you people..... GOODNIGHT"
"I needed an app that  I could download unlimited music using internet then play it later with internet I finally found that app!!!! So far I have downloaded about 120 songs and the song quality is great and  the songs  are easy to find just type  in the  name of the song and  pick the one you want.  MUST - HAVE APP :) ;)"
"One of the best books ever written, can't say how much I'm grateful for it. Changed my perspective about life about 180 degrees."
"Great book related to Peak State of Consciousness, many good examples and exercises, recommend it! Very useful and important informations!"
"There's nothing makes it feel like amagic it simply like any other..warm not so I can even see my hands through it..I give it a star cos of a fast shipping and the price..but about the quality..em em..dont recommended"
"That's what am looking for..it's have it all (nice looking ,cute,light,attractive and quality) actually it worth the price..the size match exactly sizing information and it,s the same as the picture..I love it"
"FITS BUT DOES NOT POWER UP WHEN THE BATTERY IS PUT INTO THE LAPTOP AND THE LAPTOP GETS  PLUGGED IN."
"Ok, so a vlogger recommended this book and it sounded interesting. I read 75% of it in 2 days! Very interesting facts. I don't like this guys writing style. He acts as if he wants to build suspense , but it ended up being confusing and annoying at parts. Also, he leaves some relevant facts unmentioned and unaddressed. He pours an unexpected level of personal opinion into each story, tainting(in my opinion) an otherwise uninformed/unbiased reader's perception.I have my own opinions and have read much on many of his chosen subjects and have my own opinions. That said, some of the information changed my opinions but some only darkened my opinion of the author.I liked the book, though :)"
"(5/10/13)Vendor purchased from:ArmyPropertyI've had this attached to my NcStar MOLLE/tactical vest(by VISM) for almost 3 weeks. I've no complaints about this product except for the securing system. The clips attach to the webbing perfectly, however, the straps that are supposed to secure it in place are constantly slipping which allows the carrier to sag below the comfort zone(wherever you prefer that it stays). I'm not military,  just a facilities maintenance person, but it seems that if I was carrying this all day and having to adjust it regularly in a combat zone or even in a security area,  I'd be a lot more annoyed than I am now being in an urban environment,  running from property to property, fixing, carrying, moving things. I plan on getting a heavy elastic strap and lacing it through the ends of the securing straps to see if that helps.06/20/13  The camo neoprene(or whatever it's made of) began pulling away from the top of the drink tube. My solution was to roll it away from the top to about half way, kind of like a woman's stocking, and then roll it back( I didn't let it form into a roll when pulling it back, but, made it slide down the length of the tube.)"
"Purchased from Best Service Stores. Arrived in time. This doesn't have high demand in the area of packaging, so I'd say it was adequately packed. Have it in use on my NcSTAR hydration vest(which is, itself, unimpressive) equipped with MOLLE webbing. It holds my carabiner of keys nicely.  Easy to access."
"I recently moved to a different state on a whim with little money and little clothes, and not being able to drive quite yet where I live now, I've had to resort to online shopping for what I need. Most my clothes are, shall we say, well loved, and I needed a lot of new things. These were absolutely perfect. I will say that yes, the tops unravel fairly easily, and one of the bows come undone, but other than that they fit great and are super comfy."
"I purchased this Samsung Galaxy Proclaim because of all the good reviews.  Everyone said that it worked well on Straight Talk even though it has Net10.  I just called Straight Talk and was told they could not activate this phone without a sim card!!  I have purchased a Straight Talk $45.00 - 30 day service card at Walmart and a $150.00 phone that I can not use.  DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS??"
"This vest is perfectly lightweight... just what my daughter was looking for! It may run a bit small, but she likes the fit. It is great for our weather in CA and for her to wear when going to classes. She has already asked me to buy her another one in a different color."
"My daughter loves this jacket! I ordered one in Vintage blue for her, and it looks gorgeous on her. The denim color has a nice vintage wash to it. I give the jacket 5 stars because it arrived early, and my daughter is very pleased with the cropped fit of the jacket. I'm happy if she's happy!"
"Beautiful gown. but being 5'4&amp;#34; the train was way too long so i had to get it trimmed. the top was a little big in the breast area but it wasn't noticeable. fit comfortably and fit nice around the hip area."
"Great idea!  It made my best friend laugh out loud when he opened his present.  The binoculars themselves look like the cheap type that you could buy anywhere but the purpose of the flask makes it worth every cent."
"Good Router for the price and Gigabit supports high data transfer for streaming deives&amp;#62; Overall I can rate as Good"
"CBS has Full Episodes available on their website. I think Xfinity / On Demand does as well? Otherwise, wait one week and watch it on your Prime devices without commercials. I hope it's worth the wait!Great series overall! One of the best on television last summer."
"haven't had a chance to read it yet but i loved the first book and i wanted them all in hardback"

"I was given a tube of Rhuli-gel some years ago for poison ivy and it worked great.  I then purchased a tube of Band-Aid anti-itch gel when the drug store told me I could not longer but Rhuli.  I can now no longer find the Band-aid anti-itch gel.  Where can I purchase this product and if I can't, what has taken its place, and it as good?  The Band-aid anti-itch gel is the greatest.Linda Stevens"
"I bought the pack of 2 because I saved money.  If I had purchased the hairspray in a store, it would have cost a lot more.  They were shipped fine, and I have had no problems using the spray."
"I truly enjoyed this book as much as her last one and I can't wait to read the next one! It took me a little while to get it read with the holidays but bring on the next one ! I can't wait!!"
"I so enjoyed this book and i am looking forward to the 3rd book because i have already fly though the 2nd book"
"This book was a dream! I loved this book. I couldn't have asked for a better book it was fast and it was one of them books that when you started it you didn't want to stop. So if you feel like reading a fast book this is the one!"
"This was a really good book ! I truly enjoyed the book and wish there was more of them! I guess I will just have to look for something else."
"I was very happy with The Surrender Series Books! I really enjoyed them and even had times where I couldn't put them down. They went fast but would recommend them to friends and really I already have!"
"I guess the book was ok it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be! It took it a while to get going and then it was done."
"I found the book to be pretty good and I am looking forward to reading the next book! I am thinking that I will be sad when I get to the end! :("
"I really enjoyed this book as well as the first two! I hope that there will be more to come!"
"I enjoyed this book also it was a short story but it was a good break from a longer book but it helped until i desided what i wanted to read!"
"This helmet, with its narrow profile better suits riders with longer faces than ordinary helmets that give a mushroom head effect."
"The book came in the condition that was advertised.  The book was a gift for my mother which she loved."
"When I was a kid growing up every Christmas we would make hot apple cider in the crock pot with Aspen mulling spices.  This I decided to give a taste of my childhood to my boyfriend.  Well 18 years later and they taste just a great as I remember"
"The sign came as advertised and got a great laugh from everyone.  My boyfriend loved it the most. That is good since it was his gift."
"Butt still hurts but not nearly as bad.  Cushion is fine just didn't solve problem. Still glad I bought it."
"This was a lil to small butt was still VERY hott, was very impressed by the quality of the material!"
"The top of right corner little bit unfit for the phone, but its good looking though. The price is good."

"As much as I hate to admit it, this was a really fun book to read. Romantic and sexual. Would like a little more proofreading, but I enjoyed it."
"Easy, fun read. For the most part, very well written. Not a classic novel, but extremely enjoyable with a satisfying ending. Still makes me want to find out what happens next. Is there another?"
"Picture of the poster on Amazon shows it in color, mine came in black and white. I wasn't very happy, but I guess it'll do, just posting this as a warning"
"Very very good cup, but you can't see the once because of the pictures. I recomend it anyway. Good for everything."
"My kids liked it overall. I was disappointed with the amount if tiny pieces and a bit taken aback at how small the 2 bags were when I received it for the amount it cost. I would of liked to see some larger pieces included."
"It is so fun every one I know plays it non stop I love it and you will too you can vs your friends or random people it's really awesome"
"This book grabs one from the beginning in typical &amp;#34;Picoult&amp;#34; fashion.  It took me quite some time to figure out the weaving of the myth, and to separate it from the reality of the horror of the Holocaust.  The emotional roller coaster was constant throughout the book, and created deep seated emotions in me.In the end, it all came together in a most unexpected way.  But when I considered the full &amp;#34;story&amp;#34;, it made perfect sense.  One of the best books I have read in a long, long time."
"This book was interesting on so many levels.  It was a great looking glass into the history of a time that I did not know much about.  (History major, here).  It dispelled many myths I had about that particular century, (i.e. no one ever bathed), and it made me curious enough to explore the Hapsburg family to see how close fact was to fiction.Great read.  Simple and straight forward."
"The book is huge with lots of pictures and great stories.  My mom doesn't like to read but said she reads a few pages a night because she has always loved Oprah and the blurbs are fascinating."
"Beside the bad remarks about this book, i was immediately frazzled when i  started to read it. This is an amazing book and i cant wait to read book two. :)"
"This book was the best book I've ever read. I am looking forward to reading more of these. Thanks so much!"
"What an awsome way to start a series, i most definitely will continue reading the rest.... continue please. It was great!"
"I should have trusted my instinct and bought a size B but I went with the C looking at the size chart spanx had online. Unfortunately they don't feel tight enough. Typically the higher power is firm and the material is durable but this one feels like I could rip them easily. I'm 5' 6&amp;#34; (36-29-39) and I weigh about 140. Shipping was fast and amazon was great I just should have bought a smaller size. The best part of the spanx design is the open gusset although I never use it for what its intended for...it's a good feature though."
"Haven't used yet, bought for xmas gift. Did open box, looks like great deal compared to other sets we checked in stores."
"This book gave me words that I had been searching for this whole time. It is well written and extremely raw. Like you are involved in the pain or deep love as you read it."
"I only had it a week, was not happy with it at all. It all fall apart so I would not buy again"
"My 5 stars rating is enough to express my impression of this product. However, it is better if the next edition includes some more up to date entries about the latest events happened to influence the world. I found that the dictionary is somewhat smaller than the Oxford American Dictionary,which I bought earlier, even though both have equal size in product descriptions. The content is so extraordinary, which means exceeded my expectation, the paper and cover are of high quality materials. The only question I keep asking is that the dictionary seemed specially composed for the exclusive use of American people only because the entries and pictures are too Americanized. But most of all I would not change my 5 stars rating for this product since it has brought me a newer nuance in words exploration."
"It is a very amazing study bible with complete comments. It gives me clear understanding of many verses which I previously di not understand. In short, I like it so much. The only reason why I did not rate it 5 stars is the paper which I consider too thin. But again, over all, it is a very good study bible."
"Okay first of all the packaging is pretty sexy :D I mean its full of multicolored stickers and stuff 2nd of all it fits perfectly in my note 2 the price is insane for such a Great product it's like 3 bucks a pop and they're not cheap what so ever  I would totally recommend I got my dad, sister and mom for there iPhones and s3's this is now my favorite screen protector out there thanks i smooth :D"
"This is by far the best knife I've ever owned. I love the sheath it has a very nice leather smell to it. The knife if fairly heavy which I like but its just personal preference. It came very sharp out of the box. I would reccomend it to anyone who needs a well built knife it is great for hunting and other activities."
"I'm not sure what more I could add that other reviewers haven't mentioned. I purchased this book mainly because I wanted a reference book filled with tons of beautiful photos of Native American blankets. Sure enough, the book delivered! It is my understanding that, unlike the first Chasing Rainbows, this book's photos have all been taken with a fancy digital camera which makes all of the images really pop with vibrant colors. Beyond the photos, Friedman provides a brief guide to understanding the history of the companies that were behind the blankets, thus providing context for the wonderful photos. In the end, however, it is the marvelous photos that show off the exquisite blankets that will keep me coming back again and again to flip through the pages of this fantastic book."
"This item is very good quality and very affordable. It matched my husband's adult jacket. It came in very quickly through amazon prime."
"I could not get enough of this book! I was hooked from the beginning! I would recommend this book to everyone"
"Absolutely amazing, had me hooked instantly. Great book to read more than once, I highly recommend this story to everyone"
"Very sturdy and easy to use.  The 24&amp;#34; length keeps one from having to twist or bend to get shoes on; &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on top makes it easy to remove from shoe.  My husband was heartbroken when we could not find one of these locally (so we bought two) to replace the one we had that was broken in a household move."
"Didn't work. Doesn't charge or connect iPhone. Tried the wall box and my laptop."
"Its too big but I love it I don't use it no more... I'm a guy and its just too big in my pocket but its good quality I reccomend it to women n guys who don't mind"
"I got this for a friend of mine for a Easter gift and he loved it and it's worth it!"
"Love it, had a problem with broken glass on one, company sent replacement right out:) will do lots more business as needed the them. :)"
"Well written from beginning to end. The characters were real - you  could identify with their challenges and struggles. The ending was great. The theme was evident throughout the entire story. The lessons to encourage faith and to seek God were there as well. Excellent and well done! I thoroughly enjoyed this book!"
"While it was a story of a bad thing happening to a good person, it helped the reader to journey through the trial, the fear but most of all the lessons of faith . Faith is indeed the essence of the story and how walking with God builds one's faith."
"I liked the characters.  They were real and one could identify with them.  The only negative was that the end was not as detailed as the rest of the story when they separated. Good otherwise."
"My little girls loves its taste. I believe this is a rigth choice.Hope it can work efficiently as well."
"OME, battery will last up to 4 hrs of charge. Price is high but it doing the job. Thank you."
"I live in the UK where these pants are not available so I ordered 5 pairs via a USA friend.They are excellent.Fabric not too thin or light weight and soft.Fit is first class.Style is excellent.Very worthy pants which I purchased in all colours.Only very small niggle is the inner pockets within front pocketsyou have to dig around to retrieve small items."
"I logged on to get gift cards for something I needed very quickly. I was dissappointed that it took almost an entire day to actually be a able to print the certificates. I could have gone to a store and bought a gift card in that amount of time...."
"Very beautiful!Super comfortable!I dreamed about them!Foot length 9.6The completeness of B (M)Thank you very much"
"This book reveals just how inconsistent information on the internet can be. For every truthful statement on the internet, there can be many more that are incorrect on the same subject."
"it works great and you need one if your looking for a good phone the does it all here you go"
"I absolutely loved this book! They're story was way before my time, but it doesn't matter, because some stories are so great! there just timeless!I remember hearing references to Martin &amp; lewis through out my life, but didn't know who they were. I found out later after got into Frank Sinatra. I would watch all there movies and watch any program I could find about them. But sadly they usually featured people who knew them and were around them during there comedy partnership...I wanted to hear it straight from the horses mouth!When I heard about this book, I couldn't wait to read it! It covered everything, how they met, there relationship, and why they ""called it quits"". I have to be honest, it was like I was getting a behind the scenes of there life at that time! and at times it was like I was there!I recommend this book to anyone who was aware or even slighly interested in these two amazing talents!!"
"Easy to install and It fits well on my window sill above the kitchen sink.  The always full canister flows smoothly and fast compared to faucet-mounted filter canisters.  But the instruction to disassemble the filter canister was faulty in that the opening direction of counter clockwise was quite ambiguous as to whether the it is the base or the canister that must be turned counter clockwise?"
"It worked for about two weeks and has not since. Bad product."
"I love my printer it works great easy to store but it took a while for it to ship, I expected it early like most items I have bought on amazon but it arrived on the exact date given which was fine."
"Didn't enjoy this story as much as I thought I would. Vampires are not really my thing but I thought I would give it a go.and in parts I found it boring and didn't seem to get into it as much as the cover pic promised. My mistake because I known you shouldn't judge a book by its cover."
"Run of the mill, an okay read but boring like the author has run out of new material. Wont buy again"
"Really loved reading about Hop and Laney and their story. Well written and one to be read again and again. Loved Hop, thought he was delicious!!!!"

"dvd will not play. tried on 2 different players in 2 different homes.reading disc icon continually blinks but will not play."
"I would rate it just okay - it does have some good recipes in it but some of the ingredients are in &amp;#34;british&amp;#34; english and I don't know what they mean, i.e. crumpets (I now know that mean english muffins)  but other ingredients are just baffling to me."
"A gift and apparently she likes it.  She likes to make jewelry and she suggested this book so I sent it to her."
"I like the looks of this watch and was hoping it would help my husband in determining night from day since he now has dementia.  I am a little disappointed that the face does not light up for night so he can see the time."
"Haven't heard how it works since it was a gift and sent out of town.  However, she did say she was looking forward to using this and the blocks the next time she goes to yoga.  She liked the color"

Just used it to vacuum my car got very hot and stopped working, contacted the company and they said they would send a NEW ONE,will see if they do, and if it last longernot good suction at all, not worth the hassle to use does not get up the dirt, use a broom its better"
"great product made well looks good fits my back pocket like a glove  made to last would recommend to friends"
"I only bought this one over the EatSmart Pro because I read some reviews and thought it'd be just as accurate. I got the scale and also bought a calibration weight. This thing never reads it right. Its a 500gram calibration weight and every time I put it on there I get 503, or 505, or 506. I turned it off and on, tare it every time and still get different readings. I tried my friends Eat Smart Pro and it read 500 grams every single time I tried the weight. I thought it was a fluke and tried some other weights of things I already knew and it was always off.I may contact Ozeri to see if its just this unit, but I really don't want something this inaccurate if its not. That or I will return it and buy the Eat Smart Pro and eat the shipping costs."
"I had it before all you had to do is plug it in and it worked, with this product you had a do not internet work for to work and it still didn't work."
"I gave a 4 star cause one of the three protectors I got had a dent in it. So basically only 2 out of 3 of mine were good. They fit good and work good though."
"I ordered this because I liked the design. Well in this picture you can see the shadow design really good but that's not the case with the one I received. I can barely see it at all on mine. Very disappointed by that. But does fit good on my phone and works to protect it."
"I used this flashlight 5 times before the internal switch failed. I didn't even get past using the original batteries that came with the flashlight. My single battery Fenix tactical flashlight purchased ion 5/01/2009 is of better quality and has lasted to the present day. I sure hope that our Special Operations Group warriors are not using this light in combat operations, It is s piece of crap."
"These sheets match my room perfectly. They are nice I don't think there egyptian 1200 but they are at a good price and soft!! So its a win for me!"
"I had to read this book for a book club... Couldn't finish it. Had nothing to do with the premise.  I would not recommend this book to anyone and didn't even donate it to the free books."

I honestly had no idea what 4oz was (to lazy to check) but Im very pleased with the shipping time and how the product arrived."
"I bought this tote bag for my mom, she's a Elementary school teacher. I gave it a 4/5 starts because the straps on the bag look a little thin and she tends to carry a lot of papers and books. Other than that, the shipping time and everything else was great!"
"I have a pair of these already in a different color. I got them because i am leaving for a workrelated conference and wanted to make sure I had comfortable shoes."

"Five year old belt finally broke so I needed a new one obviously. It was only $11 and columbiana is know for having good quality products. Saw a review that said a size 38 waist only had two inches left once fastened but I'm at 270's 6'2"" and there is about four to five inches of excess belt. Very sturdy, holds well, never loosens on me and looks good too. Highly recommend, I will be ordering more of there in the future."
"It was a good reading book. Keeper my interest. I am about to start boom 3. I could nit put it down."
"This book is graphic.  It illustrates stories in the Bible that children cannot understand.  There are graphic images of Lego people being circumcised or circumcising himself!  It is inappropriate and unnecessary! Yes, the Bible tells these stories, but not graphically to a child!!"
"The guilt in the past is in the past.  It doesn't define who we are now."

"Not many special features like a bluray should.  The transfer is descent.  And if u luv Night of dem demons, then just buy it."
"It was a really good book and if this ever gets to the author what happened to Nudge , Iggy , Gazzy, Tottal, and Akilla? We do not get to know if they live or not. Other than that it was a really good book and a hate that the series is over."
"iThe cost is reasonable and it does most of what is required.  What I dislike is the actual size.  It is so small it can get mislaid quire easily."
"It works how its supposed to. Shipped fast, works great. No issues. Plug and play. Good packaging and customer service."
"This is a great ring. It is in sterling, and I do wish that somebody made one in white gold instead, but that is not a reflection on this product. Great for parents or couples. Very good quality."
"Great product. No problems. Worked plug and play with my Mac. I have prior trouble with other brands not working. This is the exception!"
"Tender story of faith and new love. Worth reading and draws the reader in. Will be reading more by this author."
"Product installed easily and has worked well. Should  come with documentation describing classes of products to charge with which USB outlets, products not to be connected to avoid damage, how to replace the fuse if needed. The little slip of paper provided is laughable."
"The product was nice and a great price.  My son collects money and this made a great easter basket filler.  Thank you."

"these are great when there is no time to make or stop for coffee!  One will keep you focused for hours"
"If you can get past the taste, great for you!  It's the consistency of baby powder and goes flying everywhere if you're not careful.  After i purchased this I did some research on Soy products.  I am now soy free and i threw this crap down the toilet, literally.  Soy is not all its cracked up to be.  I would def not purchase this or any other soy product again."
"the taste of this protein powder is ok but i quit dairy and no longer use any soy, dairy or any artificial flavors or preservatives of any kind.  This is loaded with stuff you dont need.  Better off trying someting more natural"
"nasty taste and not so good for you either.  filled with garbage.  A nutritionist recommended these to a friend of mine, I told her to hire a new nutritionist!"
"this bar is ok.  just received it.  screws were missing, found some comparable but dont trust it at all. my hubby is 6'5"" and he bumps his head on it so i have to remove it after every use.  He suggested it would have been great to have brackets that are open at the top so you could slid the bar up and down to remove and install.  What a great idea.  Too bad i did see another bar i was going to buy that was just like that.  Again, bad decision on my part and I'm out 23 bucks"
"It was a great case for the price. But it eventually stretched out &amp; I only had it for about a month. I recommend it for a temporary case."
"Really great case, it was a great gift for my friend. Worth the money! I'm very impressed with the makers. Once again, fantastic item! Fits perfectly!"
"Professionally, I have been a consultant and writer for over three decades. Consulting has included providing assistance and support to those seeking to release fears, to realize understanding of inner experiences, and to expand conscious awareness. ""The Sun Has No Shadow"" by Etienne Pait is an asset of value for those seekers.When honoring the longing and yearning of heart to know one's real identity, old ""mind stuff"" emerges into view disrupting daily life. Etienne's shared life experiences and professional qualifications combine to provide a rare and significant supportive piece of material beneficial during a transformational process.It is rare today to find current written material by an author genuinely open to sharing sensitive and delicate experiences from his own life, experiences rarely shared except, perhaps, with a very trustworthy confidant. For those fearful of sensitive inner experiences little understood, there is now an author living in our time actually writing from his own life experience and has lived the ways and means to accomplish expanded conscious awareness.What a blessing Etienne's writing is, because he has carefully laid out case studies and examples along with comprehensive and practical steps the reader may successful apply to daily life to accomplish relief from fear - fear of the unknowns and reactive emotions often emerging during life transitions.When opening and beginning to read ""The Sun Has No Shadow"", a reader soon realizes they are not alone, for Etienne's sharing reveals him as a sincere fellow traveler in facing the challenges life presents. A page in the beginning of the book says it all regarding the quality of Etienne's character. It is titled 'In Gratitude'. Once one has read this paragraph, one knows they have found a loving friend.As a consultant assisting individuals facing life transitions, I thank you, Etienne Pait, for providing a written work earnest, sincere and comprehensive regarding a very delicate and sensitive subject. What a delight to now have available this supportive piece so precious to those longing in their hearts to know their real identity."

I just love Atlas he is so well you will have to read it to understand. Well done Lynn Red. I was gifted this book for a honest review. I liked it so much I went back and bought it also."
"These little shoe socks are the BEST of the bunch, and I have tried them all.  The fabric is lightweight and fits easily under dress shoes.  They don't slip around at all.  I own 8 pairs of them in a variety of colors.  Just wish they were easier to find.  A major bonus-they are made of cotton, not nylon."
"I bought this as a replacement for a game that had quit working. This game plays as good as a new one. I received the shipment in a timely manner without any problems."
"I received these as replacements on a wrecked truck. I didn't have any problems getting them to fit in the original location."
"It is beautifully detailed  however, the charm is smaller than I expected it to be.also, there is nowhere to ingrave anything."
"Perfect size for travelling with. One package of fondue cheese fit perfectly between 2 mugs. Easy clean up. May need to blow candle out 1/2 way through eating to avoid burning."
"Got this for Christmas for my wife  to replace one she had just like it just as described she loved it very good quality."
"Got this in last week to go on a new build this is my first trigger guard with the screw assembly worked great took about five minutes to install  beats the risk of breaking your ears off lower receiver with drive pins."
"Is it compatible with a universal controller so i can have a better experience with my pc because i have a universal controller."
"I loved this book.  Absolutely loved Bethany.  She was such a string woman in this book.  Loved Jace.  He would do anything for her.  I see that May is writing a 3rd book about Ash but I would love foe her to write a 4th book with all of them in it and there weddings."
"At first I wasn't sure about this book.  I don't really like the past to present, but as I got into it I couldn't put it down.I loved Brad, not Ethan so much.  I just wish Val figured it out sooner.I felt like I was in this story with Val trying to figure herself out.I also loved Clay/Jet.  He was a good guy as well.Nick was quiet but had a good since of humor, Zane was a good guy as well.  But Brad was the best.  This was a really great story.  I loved how Val finally got her happy ending she deserve.  I hope Jade writes a sequel to this with Val and Brad an  there happiness.You won't regret reading this, you may want to punch Val for giving in 1 to many times or kick Ethan for not realizing g what he had with Val.  But in the end  all I  well."
"I loved this book.  I would have given it 5 stars but I'm a little confused at the ending.  Is there going to be a 2nd book.  I sure hope so."
"This was a really good book, but very emotional.  You will need tissues.  I wanted to climb through the book at times and shake Tally and Linc.  But the book was so good.  I didn't want to put it down.  Buy it you won't be disappointed but make sure you have time and tissues."
"I was looking for a math app for my two Grandkids. They love this app and ask to play it constantly. This app seems to keep their attention and make it fun to learn math. Highly recommended."
"Don't expect this to be like the best of the best but its a good quality product. I recommend it (y)"
"Its ok I guess for the price. However, mine is missing a nub that holds the boom light over the head. Besides that, everything else is fine."
"This game is so fun to play some are easy.but most of the time I'm stumped get this app now"
"This is a good carrier to hold wine glasses. I was looking for something reasonable in price and simple. The unit arrived in great shape and was easy to assemble. The only thing I see as a con is that it extends way further than you'd expect, so the picture is a little misleading."
"This is an okay bag, but I was looking for more storage space. There are only a few departments to store items. Other organizers have more slots for storage. This would work for smaller purses. Its nice, but not as nice as the others that are on the market for purse organizers."
"Nice realistic view for Christians of &amp;#34;The Secret&amp;#34;. The Secret tells of attracting things using &amp;#34;The Universe&amp;#34;, The Secret Things of God defines it using God and Jesus Christ as the center."
"I received my item yesterday. It arrived earlier than expected, and I was very please. I love the bling look, and this accommodates my Galaxy phone, as well as protects it when its in my purse. I really love the look!"
"THIS IS A GOOD SCREEN PROTECTOR. HOWEVER, I DON'T LIKE ALL THE BUBBLES U GET TRYING TO PUT  IT ON. U MUST HAVE ALOT OF PATIENCES."
"I'm looking forward to the next book. Too many Zombie books try to deliver on the action but fail. These books deliver in spades. I think I might read the other two again because they are that good."
"The Devil Makes Three is a beautiful amalgamation of everything that is blues, ragtime, and bluegrass. The incorporation of the can mic added a a great feeling to the vocals in many of the tracks. But the retraction back to their outlaw roots with songs like Stranger, Hallelu, and Spinning like a top bring the album back to what I wanted them to sound like ever since their self titled album.I will love these guys to the end of the earth. They are everything I love about music at it's core. The raw simplicity compared to modern music and the mix of old timee sound with relevant lyrics makes for a great combination."
"Hopeless product. Don't buy it. Works fine for a while. But gets worst within days. Internet connection gets drop. Does not connect with devices."
"this was one of my favorite cds a few years ago and i lost it so i rebought it. shipping was fast, it was brand new and unopened and its a classic cd in my mind so it is great to be bumping it again. esoteric kills it. just saw the demigodz ion concert and the best song of the show was off this cd."
"i ordered this just for the swivels because i did not need the  rest of the hardware but it was worthwhile. they attach very easily and are strong enough to use with confidence. when buying generic accessories Uncle Mikes rarely lets me down."
"Its very different from what Apathy, Ryu And Scoop DeVille usually do but a classic nonetheless. Any fan of theirs wont be disappointed."
"Quality is great!!  Shipped on time for Halloween.  My daughter loved it!! Heart shapted is separate from wig so the wig can be worn on its own."
"Featured as it is!!  Perhaps value is a bit too much considering the textile/garment of the costume.  Shipped on time just for Halloween!!"
"I discoverd E45 when in England recently after trying many itch creams and oils and E45 has relieved my skin better than any.  I couldn't  buy it in Australia so was extremely pleased when I was able purchase it from Amazon."
"The power and passion of Marcus Mosiah Garvey are unparrelled.  He is truly the Father of Pan Africanism although there were some that came before him very few left the lasting impact on the concious of Black Men like The Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey."
"Great history of my illustrious fraternity. A most have for any Prince Hall Mason.  It was a very well writen book"
"I have used them once and had great success.  Even in salt water.  Didn't feel like I had the plastic diaper pants on."
"This product works OK for the green screen effect, but the size listed is not true. It is most likely the UNFINISHED size. The size is a little smaller than advertized. I would recomend this product but just be aware that it is not 10X20 as advertized."
"If you have any body that wears glasses these lens are worthless. I do, I unfortunately bought 10 of these. I'll have to throw all of them away. They do not fit well even if you don't wear glasses. You'd be better off with the cardboard 3D glasses. Absolute garbage 3D lens."
"It's hard to see your screen in the sun...Doesn't work as well as I thought it would. Also took awhile to get shipped to my house."
"This book opens up your imagination, to mind boggling possibilities. I am thinking about the what if' s. James Patterson is a superb writer, I feel like part of the flock, everything is so vivid."
"I am very pleased with this Kindle.  I'm having lots of fun playing solitaire and other games.  It's very convenient to use."
"I have used Avast Antivirus for about 8 years and I find it is a good system that has kept me from getting viruses.  I would recommend it."
"I don't read a lot of young adult fiction so this wasn't a likely purchase for me. I did, however, enjoy the book and found that I connected with the characters and wanted to know how the story unfolded. If you're looking for a light-hearted read with a little romance and a good moral, you'll like Capella Bright."
"I loved the 20th Century Fox one, this Disney one just isn't as good. They changed the dialog for Mei and Satsuki and some of it just doesn't really fit in well with the movie; also they changed the way Satsuki's name is pronounced. If you listen carefully they changed the way the cat bus meows. If I would have known that this wasn't going to be the same movie as the old VHS one I wouldn't have bought it. It's still good, but not as good as the 20th Century Fox version. Most of the dialog for the father and granny is the same and also most of the background sounds but you can tell they added some more music that to me just doesn't really fit with the original music. But now I know to make sure that when I buy movies I need to make sure they are what I really want. (i just noticed that on the cover on the Disney version they have mixed Satsuki and Mei together! Mei's hair and Satsuki's clothes.)"
"Shared very similar experiences. He kept the story exciting and fast moving. His thought about what going home would be like were true to life."
"I have had trouble finding a good case for the Nokia Lumia 1020 , some were to bulky, some to thin. This one is just right and seems well made. Great for the price"
"I think the story line is interesting enough to hold you to the end.  ending was predictable.  But still captivating enough to make me want to read the rest."
"My wife and looked at multiple sets before choosing this design.  We are quite thrilled with our purchase. They shipped on time, too."
"I can't praise this book enough. The only bad  this is having to read this book with the knowledge that it's the last in such a great series."
"An amazing adventure. Follow this young man's amazing journey through a new world and find yourself wishing it to reality."
"Honestly this is the adventure that you want to be on. Finally someone makes a book that you can actually relate to the main character. Stop reading this comment and buy all the books now. You will not regret it."
"This is for a gift, and I'm sure they'll love itIt's for Christmas and they haven't gotten it yet"
"This product was easy to assemble, glides like it should and most importantly it's fun!  My kids have been on it all week, sharing, gliding and know they've figured out how to do a few tricks."
"The return of Danny is a pleasant surprise. It was so good to find Danny, all grown having lived both the good and bad. The development of the story is fast and engaging. Abra was a delightful addition to kings list of interesting characters. Of course I'm left with the desire for book three. The what has happened to Abra book. They is enough action, mystery, thrills and spooks to keep the constant reader Turing the page. Read it. You won't regret it."
"Easy app too use and the best part is it's free!! The app and the books.always a good selection.I wish I could see the covers but that is my only con."
"I'd give this a fourth star if it were edited better. The overall content was good. Being a believer in herbs made this read a simple one. It covers the basics and is organized well.  I would like to have seen the use of the Latin names especially for plants like passion flower, horsetail since they are several species within the genera. But overall all an honest 3.5 start book. Enjoy!"
"A good magazine and the first one I've read by these folks. I enjoyed the message and the knowledge. The article on the awning was excellent. I loved that the pictures were accessible, letting me zoom in and out. I'll get more of these I think."
"I cant explain how amazing this game is its fun and scary but a good type of scary. its just al freaking fun!!! please play :)"
"The Tuscany by Easy Street fit too narrow and the material is cheap looking for the price. Sending back ."
"This has been a godsend for me. I suffered from chronic UTI's. I would finish a round of antibiotics and within a week or two my symptoms would come back. It was horrible. I started taking this and within a week I could tell the difference, no pressure no irritation, no urgency. For those that suffer from chronic UTI's you know what I am talking about. I have gone 2 months free of any UTI symptoms even if I don't drink as much water as I should some days (that sometimes was a trigger for my UTI's couldn't even leave the house without a few bottles of water in my bag) I will always make sure I have a bottle of this on hand. If you suffer from UTI's this is definitely worth a shot. I am happy that I did."
"Work Great, didn't take long to dry, very good product! Will recommed to friends.Awesome! Friends couldn't believe it was done by me."
"Looked for this song for awhile! I love the raw feel of his voice as well as his lyrics and style."
"I do like this show, and have bought two of my favorites, however, some episodes I just couldn't understand. ""Screams in the Desert"" was one of them. Why would you meet someone who is making your life a living hell alone in the Desert??!! The one with the opera singer I felt was way over the top. Other than some others, this is a great show. It is worth watching!"
"I feel more enlightened by what the President said and how he responded. I have more respect for him because he understands what the real Americans need and want in life."
"Product was as promised. I would definetly order again. These sheets fit like they should and I have never felt something so soft and comfortable. I looked forward to slipping in between the sheets at night!!!"
"Product was as promised and fits the phone as it should. I would definetly order this product again in the future."
"I gave this to a friend as a present and he said that it is just as good as the original one.  I saved so much money in buying this one and it fit perfectly!!!"
"This is my all-time favorite shows, I watch it on TV but I missed some of the first episodes and I am very happy with Amazon."
"Es un libro completisimo en composites e interesantisim. El envio ha sido muy rapido incluso en laa modalidad de envio mas economica"
"The book is large (coffee table size.) I was expecting a normal size book.  In this format, it's hard to hold and read. The pictures are very good, and if it was mostly pics and little text, it would be a winner as a coffee table book.  The title is correct; it is a compilation of essays (reflections) by other people on Oprah's success."
"Missed most of these episodes on TV, so I was happy to see them.  The five people on the show must have the best job in television."
"Honestly,solitaire is solitaire, but this is a pretty good version of it. Loads quickly and has a hint button that can help. My only criticism is that there is a ad after every hand. Annoying."
"I bought a Kindle Fire 3 months ago, and the fingertip method of typing and scrolling was okay, but fingernails got to be a problem.  Thought I'd have a bit more control with a stylus, and this one caught my eye.  Works perfectly and I'm glad to have a way to attach it to the Kindle itself.  I'm happy with my purchase!"
"This is a factory power adapter and is excellent quality.  I have come to expect the factory parts to be better and this is no exception."
"A little tricky to adjust to the right height with monitors attached but overall it works very well and once adjusted is a very solid mount."
"This thing works great.  Plenty of connectors for expansion.  It did not quite fit in the Dell case so I had to make a small modification to the case.  Not the power supplies fault.  Dell cases are idiotic and do not work with standard power supplies.  Overall this supply is a beast."
"The lock is ok but it needed modification to accommodate the safety lock mechanism on the shotgun I want to use it on"
"This castle is wicked cute but I didnt realize how big it was! And it has poles which I didnt realize either. I thought for some reason it would just &amp;#34;POP&amp;#34; up when taken out but the poles make sense when looking at it to keep the steeple up. My mistake but my kids love it and we found a place for &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; to put it on Christmas Eve. Its now back in the bag and will come out when we make room in a bedroom!"
"Cute shoe, they fit fine, I like the colors.....BUT after maybe 6 months 2 holes formed in the mesh by my little right toe. Not so happy about that."
"This by far is the best vacuum I have EVER owned! Maybe just because I have had crap upright vacuums my whole adult life but I went with the canister because I have been let down by uprights that claim they do floors when they dont. My mom and friend both have Electrolux's that havent failed them so I decided to go with it. I could have spent $30 less on a Dyson upright that claims it does floors but I wasnt going to be fooled again! This vacuum is so quiet. Now I can vacuum when the kids are outside or in the bathtub because I can still hear them! It picks up the dog hair the first time and I havent had to sweep since I got it! Yes, it's amazing!"
"I should have known better than to go with anything else but! I originally had ordered the GoGroove BasePulse 2MX speakers mainly for the blue lights. Immediately they crackled and skipped. So I returned them and ordered these. They are AWESOME! For little speakers they have awesome sound and are &amp;#34;wicked&amp;#34; loud at less than half volume. And only $10 more than the others. These also didn't crackle or skip a beat. Very happy with this purchase."
"This set is really cute and real looking! Way better than the cheapo Wal-Mart crap.Very happy mom and kids with this food set."
"So cute, comfy, and different! It's pretty true to size. The hoodie shrunk a bit so its a tad tight with a shirt underneath but overall right on."
"I like the case but the screen protector wasnt the right one for the phone and the stylus doesnt work that great. Besides the fact that it kind of plugs into the headphone port of the phone and is in the way. I took it off and threw it in my junk drawer! The tuffy isnt so tuff granted these cases are very hard to get into anyway. One corner of the tuffy broke off into the slot of the case while trying to get it off. But other than that, I like these rubberized cases. Ive dropped my phone a handful of times and never had a broken screen or damaged my phone at all."
"This book was so great. I actually got into it after watching the movie journey to the center of the earth. Very interesting. A must read if I may say so myself. And I'm really not that into books"
"This book if poorly written, but even more so it's full of crazy ideas that are about to proven false in 12 hours."
"I have tried other Royal Family mochi, and generally have had positive experiences. I really enjoy the Azuki Bean one... This was definitely not the case with the 'green tea' mochi.First they don't taste anything like green tea, I feel like even making the claim is dishonest. The only thing they have in common is that they are slightly colored green, thats it.Secondly and the worst offense of all is that these mochi taste like someone poured a bottle of pungent perfume/soap into the filling. I can't even get the taste off my tongue, I dare say it's not even edible.Into the trash they go."
"I use them for my DJ light trees to connect power from fixture to fixture as opposed to running all the power cables down to a power strip.  Much cleaner look, and so easy to connect.  Recommend to everyone."
"Ok so I gave this 4 stars only because I ran out of bluing to finish my project.  It&amp;#699;s a GOOD DECENT product, so good as a matter of fact that I bought a second kit, as well as an extra bottle of &amp;#34;Super Blue&amp;#34; along with it. My only complaint is that I ran out of bluing.With that being said...I&amp;#699;d recommend it to anyone looking to re-blue their gun.  Just be sure to buy another container of Super Blue. I think that works better than the Perma Blue they send in the package.I used this kit to re-blue a Mosin Nagant rifle.  The blue and rust remover worked incredibly well.  Degreaser was ok...I used brake cleaner and then wiped it all down with the degreaser, so I only used just a little bit.  The tru oil was good too.  I didn&amp;#699;t use the stain at all, but I will on my next project gun. And I didn&amp;#699;t use the wood conditioner either.  Instead I sanded the old finish off my gun, then used about 6 coats of the tru oil, and finished that off with about 6-8 coats of wood wax.  That worked out well.It was actually easier than I expected. Just take your time, and be ready for the smell!  Make sure you do this in a well ventilated area.  I did it in my garage, with the door open.  If you&amp;#699;ve been thinking about re-bluing your gun...go ahead and buy this kit and do it.  This kit makes it easy."
"Ok so I&amp;#699;m not sure what others are expecting out of a $25 fog machine...BUT, for what it IS. It&amp;#699;s a good product.  First off...NO, it&amp;#699;s not going to fill half a gym with fog.  And NO, it&amp;#699;s not going to have a timer. C&amp;#699;mon..it&amp;#699;s UNDER 30 BUCKS!!!  It&amp;#699;s a good machine for what it is.  If you take good care of it, it should last.  To give you an idea of how much fog it puts out.  I put a good amont of fog in my 2-car garage on just ONE blast.  After 2 or 3, the whole garage was filled.  Here&amp;#699;s my take:PRO&amp;#699;s:  Small, lightweight, inexpensive, decent quality built of good materials. 3-5 minute warm-up time, and same amount of time between fog blasts.  Fog blast lasts about a minute or so.CON&amp;#699;s: Small tank.For those of you who broke it after the 1st or 2nd use.  A couple of fog machine basics:#1 CLEAN IT AFTER EVERY USE!  Dump out whatever leftover fog juice you have, put some distilled water in there, and shoot it for a few minutes.  Then dump the water and store the machine.#2 DON&amp;#699;T RUN THE THING DRY!I&amp;#699;m thinking about buying another one and running one on each side of my DJ rig.UPDATE:I changed my rating to FIVE ***** Stars.  Why?  Because I&amp;#699;ve used it a few times, and it is MORE than decent for what it is. It&amp;#699;s REALLY GOOD for what it is!  I spent less than $30 bucks on this little machine and while it&amp;#699;s not pumping out sheets, or cloud billows of fog...it puts out more than what I expected from this machine!  I did a small (50-80 pax) DJ gig in a basketball gym, and NO...this machine DID NOT fill the place or even a quarter of the place. But what it DID do, was put enough fog in front of my lights to make it a little more dynamic up front. And that&amp;#699;s all I expected it to do.  Did it meet my expectation?  YEP. And it exceeded it because I only filled it about 1/2 way, and that thing ran the entire gig (3-4 hours). The warm up time is around 5-7 minutes, and then it takes about the same amount of time, maybe just a little less: 3-5 minutes in between blasts, but it&amp;#699;s good.  I think the key here is CLEANING THE MACHINE AFTER EVERY USE.  That&amp;#699;s where people run into problems.  You cannot leave fog juice in this thing for an extended period of time. So I just run distilled water thru it after every single use.And I decided NOT to buy a second machine. Instead, when I upgrade my lightng and buy a truss system, I&amp;#699;ll spend the money and get a bigger machine.  Until then, this little puppy does a fine job."
"I got this sprayer with my Duracoat shake n spray kit, and while at first I was a little hesitant about spraying the slide of my glock 34 with this...I am very pleased with the results. I also duracoated my Blackhawk holster, kydex knife sheath, knife handle, 2 AR-15 magpul magazines, my forward grip, AR buttstock and grip.  And I still have a little propellant left over in the canister.  This is just to show you how much I was able to do with just ONE can.As far as spray... YES, an airbrush would have a finer finish. But the finish on this was good.  Actually REALLY good.  My glock slide isn&amp;#699;t completely smooth, and has a fine texture to it.  At first I wasn&amp;#699;t sure about it...BUT, once I put my gun back together and racked the slide, I realized something...NO FINGER PRINTS on my slide!!!!  I&amp;#699;m ALWAYS wiping down my slide because my friends gun has prints on it that are just STUCK now. So I&amp;#699;m constantly worried about that.  But this finish gives my slide an ever so light texture.  And I like that alot.  On my AR polymer stock and grip it came out smooth.  LIke factory smooth.  I&amp;#699;m sure it&amp;#699;s because it&amp;#699;s the polymer.  But it looks really good.  The kydex to it very well also.  l was very pleased with the results.I rated it 4 stars because I like it and I would love it if it were a little bigger, and came with smaller jars.  That way I could clean out the sprayer, and attach different color jars quickly.  Also, because it&amp;#699;s a canned product, you need to be careful to shoot some out after setting it down for a few minutes to prime the paint thru the system.  But it works, and works well enough that I just bought two more of these power units to paint other gun parts.Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to use duracoat or any other coating application."
"I have a DJ light rig and I bought these cables to jump from fixture to fixture without having to run all the power down to a power strip.  They work great, and I&amp;#699;d recommend them to everyone."
"Not much you can say about an Xbox wireless controller other than it works, and my son loves having 4 of them."
"I have an AR style buttstock on my Flex 500. This LimbSaver fit perfectly, and it really tamed the recoil on my shotty, even with magnum slugs.  Although...it&amp;#699;s gonna kick no matter what with those!  But...it&amp;#699;s still a lot better than just the plain buttstock pad alone.  I&amp;#699;d definitely recommend to anyone looking to put it on a shotgun!"
"I&amp;#699;ve used this multiple times on my smoker, as well as my grill.  Hasn&amp;#699;t failed me yet.  Did a tri-tip with it to perfection on my grill.  I cannot tell exactly how accurate it is, but it&amp;#699;s close enought to my needs.  I like the ability to use both probes, and I also like how it will tell you if the temp in my smoker drops below 220 or if it gets too hot.  For the price...it&amp;#699;s well worth it.I&amp;#699;ve seen reviews saying how its inaccurate or it gives weird readings... mine hasn&amp;#699;t yet. It could be just a bad unit.  But since this was sold and shipped by Amazon, I had no worries about being able to return it for a replacement.  So...make sure it&amp;#699;s being sold and shipped by Amazon..and buy with confidence!"
"It worked exactly how it should...and when I run out, I&amp;#699;ll buy another 2 to 3 rolls!!! I Love it!"
"3 pack, they work good and I&amp;#699;m glad I got them!  I have one in my truck &amp;#34;get home&amp;#34; bag, one in my camping gear, and one in my EDC bag.  They were a great deal, and they work great."
"The decal sticker was very easy to apply (took less than a minute) and looks pretty good on my back window. The cost was great and it came pretty fast."
"Gave as a gift and the person who received it loves and is a big fan of Andreas Will order more of his cd's."
"I love these guys they are so talented and sings so well.  Their voies are amazing.Would recomend this to all that enjoy good music."
"This is a fantastic read with a sweet story and the beginnings of a great tale of love and romance. The hope and joy of the characters drive a very uplifting journey. I could not stop smiling!"
"This thing is awesome.  Between this and my Galaxy Note I can get just about anything done.  I don't use my laptop any more."
"I really enjoyed this book except for the frequent use of the f word. I rate this book a star rating of 3."
"This product is great, very easy to use and full of apps.The shipment was fast and I could keep track of its arrival."
"Perfect Cd for the Christmas season. My daughter plays the mandolin and this CD has been a great encouragement to get her playing some new songs."
"Husband loved itGood quality.  Very happy. Very durable and hasMany compartments. I recommend this product.Wil buy again"
"Authentic! All stores are still charging $160.for these!!!  I love the color and size. Comfortable. They come in the case"
"I love the wallet. I got it for myself. I bought along with a Tommy watch and the look great together. Tommy Hilfiger Men's 1710294 Stainless Steel and Leather Strap White Dial. Trust me u wont be disappointed."
"I love the helmet and the price. The extra lens is great and easy to take off and put on"
"I love this watch. Get compliments all the time. I have a small wrist and this fit prefect but I put on my Dad and he is larger still looks excellent.. Great price. You really cant beat Amazon's prices."
"These bag is made of great material. Looks fantastic. I am taking it skiing these week for the first time and cant wait. I fit a pair of ski boots, 2 ski pants, 2 goggles, 2 gloves, 2 hats, and a face mask. Everything fits perfect. 74L"
"I bought this for my girl and she loves it. I get her to come with me more often now that she has her own nice helmet"
"Great shoe.  Fits my orthotics. Nice colors."
"Excellent item beautiful and weatherproof I would highly recommend great way to decorate your patio or take along for comfortable and beautiful sitting area"
"I was very pleased and educated by this book,well written for new students  and advanced ones who want to deepen even more in pranayama"
"Very pretty hand bag, its kinda small, doesnt fit alot of stuff, but would definetely buy again in other colors."
"I love this handbag, i thought it would be kinda small but its great in size, fits alot of stuff."
"I enjoyed reading this..Judy wrote with such passion AND humor. I recommend this reading for anyone going through cancer. Judy says it's not the end of the world !Suzanne (Roanoke, VA.)"
"This is a great Pizza Paddle. It is very well made and slides under the pizza with ease. I would highly recommend this Pizza Paddle. Great Product!!!"
"i received it timely mannrr and my phone looks great. i loved it. i really like the feel of it."
"I recieved the device ,, it works very well ,, easy to use ,, easy to installI like it so much"
"Just awesome! amazon is the bomb.com and I just love the affordable prices!  Awesome selection of items to choose from!"
"teach me a lot. give me more ideas about living in a health life.again, it is a nice book."
"There must be thousands of diet books out there.  In such a crowded landscape its hard to believe that a new book could come out with a new approach and simple, effective ideas.  But this is exactly what Ms. Pires has achieved.  Rachel teaches how to determine the daily caloric intake that will enable anyone to slowly and efficiently lose weight down to their target level.  She provides many great insights on how to accomplish this in both a healthy and effective fashion.  As someone that has struggled with my weight since passing the age of 40, I am very excited to try Ms. Pires' approach.  This method really appeals to my mathematical mind and my palate !"
"This costume was BASICALLY what you expect looking at it.  However, the belly was extremely baggy, and I'm by no means a twig.  An average adult male needed to stuff it with pillows to fill it out.  Also the snout droops considerably, which also had to be corrected using a nifty contraption that included a paint stirrer and some grocery bags...and sewing.  You get what you pay for with this costume."
"i got to organize my kids coats in the closet with these sturdy hooks. they look durable and are great for towels coats etc"
"great tub organizer. now all thise littletoys in the bath tub finally have a place. and the kids love packing the items in there!"
"I found it as a great gift option. Good size, and quality materials. Just as shown on the web information."
"Perfect size and weight.  Exactly what I hoped it would be!  Extremely pleased.  Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed!"
"Kershaw knows knives. Ken Onion knows knives. You know you want this knife.Came sharp as a razor out of the box. Beautiful knife. Speedsafe is an awesome technology and should be praised for its safety value. This is not Kershaws best knife, but one of the most popular in the world and for good reason."
"Wonderful little case. Very low-profile, fits my Wingman perfectly. Strong little leather, and I love the fact that it has a clasp and not Velcro, which always seems to wear out after a year or so."
"Solid knife. I'm a huge fan of a sheepsfoot blade. The handle is plastic yes, but it's a strong lightweight zytel polymer that can stand up to most anything. And for under a hundred bucks, a good deal. Benchmade wins again."
"Wonderful knife! Razor sharp out of the box, well oiled, excellent finish and gimping. Don't be afraid to purchase this knife!"
"For the money, this is a great knife. Good g10 handle, excellent maneuverability with the blade type, steel holds a decent edge and sharpens easy. Good buy, wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
"God I hate myself for liking this song, but I do.You know you do too. Just buy the dang thing."
"For the money, its really not too bad. I recommend it if you want cheap protection that wont break the bank."
"Very nice stuff. Strong! I tested it right away with 350lbs of gym weights over my balcony(Don't recommend to those in apartments!) and held like a steel beam."
"Based off of Benchmade design, this is a good knife for the money. A wee bit of play in the blade when locked, but still worth the money. May need to be run through the sharpener and a good stropping when you get it, but that is expected from a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; knife. Bee is not a cheap brand though, so don't be afraid to purchase. Worth the money."
"I ordered Minnetonkas because I heard from several of my close friends that they were very reliable shoes that would be comfortable and cute. So when I finally saved up enough to order them I was excited for them to come. When they came in the mail I tried them on right away and the right foot was VISIBLY BIGGER than the left. It flopped off my foot, and I have full intentions of either exchanging or just completely returning them. I am extremely disappointed."
"To boring and I thought people write books better than this. BoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooI can't even describe it, just joking I read it I love it :)"
"[...]  CLICK ON LINK FOR OVERVIEW OF PRODUCT. PRODUCT UNBOXED AND OVERVIEWED. its a great item but watch the video"
"it's simply a very, very good card. no technical issues, singular design, everything in place and at the right pace. look out for special offers on that, if you can get it at almost the price of a good class 4 card, it's a no-brainer."
"Great set of crimper and dies for the price,  The case is convenient and stores the crimper and dies securely.  Comes with a wide variety of dies.  It even has a die that will do large AWG insulated cord end terminals.  I believe it can go as large as 6 AWG.  Very hard to find one that does large AWG.  As for the ratcheting mechanism and the crimp, it does not come close to knipex crimpers.  I use the knipex master crimper with die sets almost ever day and there is a huge difference.  The crimp action on the Knipex is almost effortless.  I even have a dedicated ratcheting insulated terminal crimper from knipex and it is day and night compared to astro pneumatic. That damn thing only crimps insulated terminals and it's $130.  The problem is, Knipex will not only break the bank, but it will close your account hahaha.  I paid almost $200 just for the master crimper pliers WITHOUT ANY DIES AT ALL!!!  THE DIES ALONE RUN FROM $100-$200.  Laugh all you want but while you are laughing, I just rewired and repaired a backup generator that provides back up power to hospitals when a natural disaster hits.  I bought this astro pneumatic set as a gift for an employee/apprentice of mine.  He always complains that he has to use the old style crimpers with no ratchet where you actually have to squeeze to crimp.  He has some girly hands for a field engineer.  I tried his set out and I was so glad I didn't go cheap on my own tools.  This AP set is great for the auto mechanic or electrician but not for us engineers that hold life and death in our hands.  Sound pretty over dramatic huh?  I would give it a 3.5 but I will round it up to 4 stars.  Amazon, please try and get the Knipex tool prices to go down a bit.  Thanks"
"It had great romance, great story, alot of action.  Loved it better than the first book, looking forward to the third."
"great good. perfect condition. Will be giving it to my son for Christmas. I'm sure it will bring much joy to our family :)"
"I ordered them in black and when they arrived they were so perfect. fit great and so soft. I would order every color if I could. I am incredibly happy with these. and fast shipping and great packaging. I could go on and on about these. Thank you. Would buy from this seller in a second. :)"
"This book was so good. It has to be a part 2. I'm waiting on a second part because of how it ended."
"This thing is rock solid and easy to install on a shotgun. Coupled with a Nebo light its a great weapon light for a home defense gun. You dont have to spend big money to get a great weapon light. I have a surefire with a qd mount but the Nebo has more spill and illuminates the inside of my house better than the much more expensive lights. I CRANKED down on this light mount when tightening it and it didnt break, but realize to get it very secure you are going to have to tighten it a lot. Its going to take you a few minutes to install but once its on, its not going anywhere. I am planning on buying another shotgun in 20ga for my wife. I dont know which gun I am buying yet, but i already know which light and mount it will get. This one."
"I was skeptical about the quality of these because of the crazy low price. I couldnt believe that they were actually better than the brand name polishing pads. They are more dense and stand up to more abuse without the mandrel spinning freely inside them. I will buy again once i wear these out."
"It is a good product. I had mu + test even before my missed period. It arrived on time, its sell price is very low and it is a reliable product...love it!"
"This product works well, was in good y family ... and i really enjoy playing it .goog job guys"
"Too commercial!!!!  I will delete....and find something else to play.  Poor response and slow.  Trying to get you to buy all the time."
"I call this my cheatsheet because having it at my fingertips really helps when I do the genealogy online.  it has many helpful tips.  Love it!"
"My favorite part of this guide is the 10 steps to a solution--very helpful.  It is also at my fingertips when going online and doing my family tree."
"I really love the mini flags.  they fit perfectly in the stand and look very nice.  I will order more as I progress in my family background.  Highly recommend the stand and flags.  Excellent price!"
"I chose this stand for the quality and for the flags in my family tree.  it is excellent!  It looks very nice on my stand and I will be ordering more as my family tree expands."
"Good buy!  It is heavy, but the results of using it are great.  It will make you work and the good thing about it is the opportunity to increase workout gradually.  So for this 65 year old-- its great!"
"Super comfy and soft! I'm slightly larger in the behind region and thought they might be slightly transparent in the back but they are not. I usually wear a size 7/8 pants size and these fit wonderfully. I have extra room to stretch and there is no camel toe in sight. I highly recommend these!"
"Haven't finished this 3rd one but these books do keep your attention. A little surpising with the bedroom graphics but you can't help yourself.  Will there be more? Hope so."
"This was a Christmas gift for my 18 month old Granddaughter. It was definately a hit as she doesn't want to quit playing long enough to eat or sleep! Great little kitchen that comes with accessories and any child would enjoy."
"This high quality knife is the perfect size for cutting anything from meat to cheese to tomatoes.  It is very comfortable in the hand, a pleasure to use and very sharp!"
"Beautiful. I only wish that this really happens in real life. It's sad how many people give up on true love."
"I love Brooke and Remy. I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was with Brooke, watching Remy fight. It was great."
"The extinction Wars, so far, have been a great and fast read. Definitely looking forward to the next book in this series!"
"The speed button on the remote.I really love this fan. It is extremely quiet while still putting out a great amount of air movement. I love that it has 5 speed settings. I love that it has a remote. However, right out of the box, the remote will only control power and timer, but the speed button (to me, one of the most important functions because it is used in our bedroom) will not work. It boggles my mind that the other two buttons work, but the speed button will not. I'm not sure who I should contact about this issue, or if it is even covered by the warranty. Anyway, I still love the fan. Having a black fan goes so much better with decor than a white one and helps conceal dust that fans are bound to collect."
"One star because I haven't actually seen the book.....it's just that there were 2 things I did NOT know until I read these reviews:  The first is that I did not know that the real, original, ORIGINAL 1611 KJV Bible contained the apocryphal books (I'm a bit tongue-in-cheek here).  I don't believe that any &amp;#34;KJV Only&amp;#34; people read the apocryphal books--why not?  I also did not know that apparently some people believe even the font size and style is inspired.Now maybe someone, perhaps a KJV Only person, can explain what I do with this dilemma:  I have relatives in France, Germany, and Poland.  They and their parents, etc., were all born in Europe.  They all speak 2-3 different languages.  What version should they be reading?  Would the English be superior and why?"
"I first read this book well over 20 years ago, so it must have been the original version.  I was young and foolish then (even more so than now! LOL) and I still remember how appalled I was that a woman should shake her curls at her husband, pound her fists on his chest, and have a hissy fit so she could get her way.  How juvenile!  And I suppose I should try that tactic on my employer, the person who serves me in a restaurant, my neighbors, speaking with my child's teacher, etc.  I'd soon be ""under observation"" somewhere for my bizarre behavior, I'm sure.  I would never EVER recommend this book."
"I really thought this item would be different. The sizing was offhand it looked bad on. I'm not sure if I needed to go down a couple of sizes but it just wasn't what I was wanting."
"I've been using these eyebrow pencils for quite a few years now. I'm very satisfied with the product. I do miss the handy sharpener at the end of the pencil though, but that just a minor inconvenience."
"I use this every day and Love it! I found it much cheaper on Amazon than in any other stores or web sights! I get so many complements on how wonderful I smell. Will order again. Thank You for the opportunity to buy this on-line."
"fit perfectly.  everything I expected.  loved it.  came quickly and  looked amazing on.  I am not a skinny woman either and it managed to lay beautifully over my hips"
"I read this on my son's recommendation and it was great read. So well written, thought provoking, sometimes poetic. Rings of truth in the portrayal of parents left to survive vs the children waiting to die. Touching on the dual existence of individual beliefs with an universal need to seek and give comfort. Tells the story without dragging it out; letting the ending quietly linger."
"Visual and hilarious character development. The description of the attitude of the town folk is spot on. Bertie is wonderfully written; vivid personality. She could definitely be the grandmother of someone I know."
"I put this poster in my dorm and it adds so much to my side of the room! perfect size and it came right away"
"I'm very satisfied with my purchase of an Apple iPhone 4S, it was delivered as scheduled, and a great value. Look forward to future purchases."
"I bought these headphones because of the low price and also because of the fact that they were turtle beach they worked fine the first day I had them I could talk to other players and they could talk to me however the next day I adjusted them and went to put them on and a small piece of plastic holding the left speaker on snapped right now I have it taped on and am using these temporarily until I can purchase a better headset if it wasnt for theFact of how cheaply these were built these would be fantastic the speakers are great and so is the microphone but it is just to flimsy and fragile and break to easily I would reccomend turtle beach x12 or x32 they are much more expensive but the quality is much better"
"I can't wait to read the next one and I really enjoyed this book. I strongly recommend to take it and you will definitely like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Captives of the Zone. Hope the new one will be announced soon!"
"I was so disappointed when dish network cancelled AMC.. and so relieved i could still watch my favorite show by purchasing the episodes thru amazon! Love the series, i have been following it since day one!!! Definately reccomend."
"Bought it for my Azus tablet so far works good. Its not 'bulky'or 'rubbery' so its not a hassel to deal with."
"The sound allowed still seems really loud to me.  I wish I could control more and make it even quieter.  It gets loud enough for them to say it hurts their ears if we're not careful enough to make sure the volume is down from the beginning."
"Really GOOD, but not so easy handle with a single hand."
"This product protects my tablet. There's better products out there I'm sure, but this one for the money serves it's purpose.I like it."
"i like itit's my favorite boot but the bottom easy to wear and tear&amp;#12290;maybe i need more  enough?"
"I've heard that OtterBox cases are really nice and getting this commuter series proved it to me. This case doesn't give too much bulk which I was worried about. It took a few days more than expected to arrive with free supersaver shipping but it was worth the wait. I would recommend this to people prone to dropping their phones, or anyone who wants the security of a really good phone case."
"*ARC provided by Harlequin Teen via NetGalley. Thank you so much!*4.5 stars!Well, I think it's obvious... The first and most important question: WHY HAVEN'T I READ ANYTHING BY JULIE KAGAWA YET??? I really don't know. Geesh, this woman is awesome! I love her writing. She creates an amazing world in this novel and I actually get details on the worldbuilding, which is awesome. She fascinates me from the start and she got the vampires really good in this one. Okay the story seemed a mix of I am Legend, True Blood and a sniff of Hunger Games, but that's not bad, is it? No! It's more awesome!But seriously... A world were books are illegal? Just hang me already. I wouldn't last a day there. No books? No no no no no no. That's not how I roll. I need ma books okay? But I loved every part of this book. Part 1 was good, part 2 was better and part 3 was awesome. So yeah. You get it. It got better and better every chapter.Okay, the characters. I love Allie. I love her as a human and as a vampire. She's a kick-ass heroine all right. She's stubborn and she can really kick some ass if she needs to, but she's also caring and loving and she doesn't want to hurt anybody, even as a vampire.I liked Lucas and Stick, and I loved Kanin, even when I didn't knew his name yet. OH and I loved Zeke and his group. Yeah. Zeke. *sigh*This book is a lot of awesome and I'm going to read the sequel soon. This review will also be on my blog."
"Sequels are always hard to write. People usually have high expectations if the first book was really awesome (which is was in this case) and it's difficult to live up to those expectations of all of your fans. But Julie Kagawa did exactly that, because this book is AWESOME!Yeah I use that word a lot, but it's true! Allison still is badass, but she annoyed me a bit in the beginning. I get it, she misses Zeke and to be honest, I would too, but come on... Just kick some ass and maybe you'll get to see him again! She struggles to keep her humanity and control her vampire side and doesn't always succeed in that. So I still love her!It was cool to get to know the other characters better too and see some old ones from the first book return! I did miss some of themJulie's writing still is beyond brilliant. I love how she describes the world she has created and in this novel we get more details of that world, which is great because it helps me to get more into the story! She keeps me on the edge of my very comfy couch and really hooks me to the story in a way not many authors can. And she can make me swoon with some scenes. I seriously was reading with a big smile on my face at times. She can take my breath away and crush my heart at the same time. (Thanks for that...)Of course she left me hanging at the end, which I kind of expected from her, but it sucks nonetheless...I give this book 4 stars because the slow beginning and Allison's references to Zeke in the first few chapters were a bit annoying but it's a great book and those who love the first one, will love this one just as much!"
"This was such a nice surprise! I went into One Man Guy with mixed expectations and I just ended up loving it to bits. It's such a surprisingly light and fun summer read. In one word: adorable.One Man Guy tells the story of Alek. Alek's family is Armenian and very much grounded in their own traditions. Alek doesn't always feel like he belongs though. When his parents force him to go to Summer School, his whole summer seems to be ruined. But then the cool and handsome Ethan notices him and Alek's summer just got a whole lot better. Ethan seems to want more than just be friends, but what does Alek want?Wow, talk about diversity! This book is not only about a young man/boy discovering he's gay. It's also about that boy's Armenian heritage. I was surprised by how much I loved that aspect of the book! I was a bit hesitant about it going into the book, but Michael won me over immediately! The stuff we learn about the Armenian people was really interesting and yes, I did get a bit hungry from all that talk about the foods they have. Makes me want to try Armenian food.While this may not be the best writing ever, it's still very good. I was sucked into the story right from the start and it didn't let me go! Alek was such a great main character and I liked him a lot! I think a lot of people can relate to him. He's stuck between being who his parents want him to be and being who he really is. I really did feel for him and with him. I was just as annoyed by his parents as he was and I loved that! His parents were a bit annoying at first. They really stick to their traditions and beliefs and while I respect that, it did annoy me a bit. They grew up in America themselves so they can expect their kids to be a bit more modern than they are too! But they grew a lot in this book and I really liked that! Alek's brother Nik, who seems like the perfect son, also grows! The character development in this book is fantastic! Everyone grew in this book. They all learned from their mistakes.I loved Becky, Alek's best friend. She was fun, quirky, a bit of a nerd, ... She's such a great friend to Alek and I loved their friendship. It felt so real and genuine. And then you have Ethan. I loved him so much. He's confident and free spirited. Almost the opposite of Alek. He has a really good influence on Alek, learning him that it's not wrong to want something and be yourself. Their romance was absolutely perfect. It built up slow in the first half and the second half was just one swoon-worthy moment after another. So sweet and adorable!One Man Guy is a very fun, sweet, adorable summer read that I'd recommend to everyone who loves a good contemporary romance book with a little more diversity in it. I loved it and I can't wait to see what the author brings us next! And yes, Kat, I did want to hug everyone in this book by the end."
"Damnit Sarah, now you've made me cry all sorts of tears. Guess you're on my list of Authors who made me cry now. And you're the second person who wrote a book I dreamed about after reading it.This is the story of 20-year old Charlie. After her brother died, she goes to his home in San Diego, far away from her home in Tennessee. There she meets Jhett. A friend of her brother. And then Charlie's life changes and her parents are not to fond of that.I loved this story. A lot. I liked Charlie. In a way she reminded me of myself. (Except for the fact that I don't have rich parents.) She's pretty shy and has always lived the life her parents wanted her to live. Her brother never wanted that so he moved to San Diego and he wanted her to move there to, but she never took that step. Until she meets Jhett. More on him later. I loved seeing Charlie grow as a person. She can be pretty stubborn and I loved hearing that Tennessee accent in my head when she was angry.Jhett. Oh my god.... He's yummy. I love him. He's awesome. I want him.The writing is very good, which I had hoped because I didn't want to hate this story. Sarah is a friend of mine and I'm so glad that she did so well! Yeesh, she even made me cry. Really cry! That's hard to accomplish with me (over a book, that is... series or films, no problem.), so you can say that she is a real new upcoming talent! I felt everything Charlie and Jhett felt and I loved them so much. I loved the fact that there is actual character development in this book! They both grow because of each other. Awesome. But I hate Charlie's mom. God, she's an awful woman.So yeah, I loved this book. I'm a beta reader for it, so maybe things will change in the editing process, but it's awesome nonetheless. Read it. It comes out next month and you can win a copy in the big giveaway I'm having at the end of June! (Or sooner.)"
"I just have to say it again. This cover is beyond awesome. Seriously.Now, the book. Well, it's awesome too. It really really is. I loved everything about it. The story, the characters, ... It's original and fun and exciting and romantic and so much more. I suggest you read it as soon as you can because it absolutely belongs to my best-books-ever list. I love love LOVE it. Can't say it enough. I can't wait for the second book in this series!Thank you D.T. for giving me an ARC copy of this brilliant book. You better not let me wait to long for the second.Short review, but what else do I have to say? If you want to know more about the book, then read it!"
"Well, I finished, but only because I got this book for review from Netgalley. That's the only reason. This will be one of those review I hate to write, but sometimes you just have to.So... yeah... This book was not that good. Not what I expected at all. Basically this book is about Maddie. She is new at college and in the beginning of the book we meet her when she is getting her annual tattoo. She does that too numb the pain of her parents murder seven years ago. Sounds like a cool character, doesn't it? Well, it isn't. She sounds like a cool chick with issues, but actually she's a naive (or dumb) 18-year old girl who never watches tv, never had a cell phone before and don't know what 'kinky' means. Yeesh. Talk about unrelatable. That wouldn't bother me if I had seen more of the traumatised, broken side of her that witnessed her parents murder. But I rarely saw that. 80% of the time she is just a normal (stupid, dumb and naive) girl. Yeah... No.Then we have Kyle. His dad is the one who killed Maddies parents al those years ago. I didn't like him either. Just another stereotype boy that has some issues he never deals with and instead only thinks of sex. *Yaaaawn*The rest of the characters were not all that memorable for me, so that's not good either.The romance in this story is one of the main things. Maddie has been in love with Kyle for years because they used to be best friends when they were young. I hoped for a good romance here, but it was just kissing and no bonding most of the time. Yeah, that doesn't do it for me. Especially when I got the background on how they used to be. They made some kind of pact when they were eleven to be each others firsts. First kiss, first date, etc,... And when they see each other again after so many years, no bonding and catching up at all? Another let down in this book. Sigh. Oh and I for one, could never fall in love with a guy whose father killed my parents. Maybe I'm just weird for that. *shrugs*The writing.... Well... I've read much better. Really. The double POV didn't work for me. At all.If you expect a great, uplifting book about hope, forgiveness, love, drama, etc,... Don't hold your breath, because that's not what this book was for me personally. I am really sorry, but I just didn't like this book at all. It's a shame though... I like the cover and the blurb made it sound so interesting... *sigh* I'm sorry for the negative review. I really don't like doing this."
"Ooooh how I've missed these characters! Faith, Harmony, Krista, Carson, Maryah, Nathan,... I've been waiting for so long to know how your story would go on! And know I know, and I want to know what happens next!The writing was as good as it was in the first book, maybe even better. Karen Hooper is one of those really talented writers who can hook me to a book and let me stay up late because I just can't stop reading. I really love her and I love this series. It's so awesome! In this book we get to know a little more and we get to know new characters. There's action, romance, friendship, drama,... It's all there. And I still want to know more. Why did Maryah erase? That's the main question. Some of the questions are answered in this book, but most of aren't, which is good, because it makes me, as a reader, curious for more.What's also awesome, is that you can choose in this book! You want a cliffhanger? Or rather not? You can choose in this book! (Just read it and you'll understand.) I do recommend reading the first book before this one, because it starts right where the last one left off and you won't understand a thing in this book. There's no recap here. (So more time for the story to get on! Yay!) But since these books are awesome, it won't be time wasted.I know this review is not very long, but I can't say much else without spoiling the whole thing. So I'll leave it at this, but I do have one more question that has been burning in my mind since I read the first book... Where can I get my own Nathan???"
"Okay, up until the last chapter, this book was pretty standard with a little twist in it. A girl on the run from something or someone, meets a hot, very rich guy on the plane that is instantly obsessed with the girl, but has his own issues and past. And then the last chapter threw a one big twist in my face that leaves me with one giant questionmark.Escaping Reality is about Amy Bensen. Amy has gone through something in her past and now she's running for it. New name, new home, new life. And while running again after six years of peace, she meets Liam Stone on the plane. He's a very handsome, very rich and very talented architect. And he's instantly obsessed with Amy. They start a passionate affair, but Amy keeps doubting if she can trust him at all.Like I said before, this book is pretty Fifty Shades-like in the beginning. Except for the big mystery behind Amy herself, which I'm still figuring out after finishing the book. The writing was okay, the story was... yeah standard. The only thing that makes it a bit different from all the other books in the genre is the mystery behind Amy. Which, luckily, is enough to keep my interest up, but after a while, that stops. Nothing really happened until the very end and that wasn't enough in my opinion. Yeah sure, it gives me some questions, and I do want to know the answers, but still...The characters were.... Okay? Liam is very Christian-like and basically, I'm getting sick of that type. Rich, hot, issues from the past, obessed with the main girl for some reason,... Honestly, if I were in those situations as those girls in the books are when they meet the rich, hot guy, I'd run away from them. I don't need some obsessed guy who wants to own me. So no, I didn't really like him. As for Amy... Well she was somewhat the same as the girls in the other books. They throw back feminism by hundreds of years and I don't like that for one bit.So basically it's pretty standard and despite that, I do want to read the sequel because I need answers to those questions. I recommend this book to people who love Fifty Shades of Grey and other books like that."
"Okay I know a lot of people have doubts about High School Romance books, but this was something else. It's set in the 80's AND the main guy is a hot Korean. That's cool, right? Okay, just the hot Korean guy then. This book... This book was EPIC.I really really really really loved this book. The writing was so good. Funny, clever, romantic, exciting,... I really felt what the characters felt and I loved with them, cried with them, laughed with them... I loved the fact what holding hands for the first time did to Eleanor and Park. They were so cute together and by the time I was halfway through the book, I was just waiting for them to kiss and when they did, I just melted and was trembling the whole time for the rest of the book. And then I cried and cried and cried... And then I was confused. Seriously. I have no clue how this book ends, the last chapter was just soooo confusing.I love how the relationship between Eleanor &amp; Park grows. You can practically see them falling in love and you just can't not love them. You just have to love them. Just have to. I loved Park. For some reason when I first imagined how he would look, Zuko from Avatar The Last Airbender, came to my mind. Without scar that is. Don't know why. He just did. And Eleanor is so cool and different and not the stereotype perfect-looking skinny girl. I like a girl with a little meat on her bones. YEAH! Go Eleanor! You rock! Plus, red hair... Duh, that's just awesome. I love this. But still, confused about the end.So that's what I think of this. I want to thank TT for recommending this awesome book. Just another book for my best-books-ever shelf. For those who haven't read it yet, I highly recommend you do."
"Actual Rating: 3,5 starsSing and the darkness will find you.With a sentence like that on the cover I was totally prepared to read an awesome book with some cool action and a kick-ass heroine. But... I expected to much because, although I liked it quite a bit, I still feel like it let me down. And I would've liked to know that the story takes place a few centuries ago. Between 1667 and 1669. Maybe that sounds stupid, but I like that kind of information beforehand. Not that it matters a lot in what time the story takes place, it's just a detail that's important to me.First of all, I liked the characters in this story. Lucy and every other character in it matter. How small their part may be, they're all important and I like that. So many books have characters that don't really help the story and are unnecessary, this one didn't. So that's a good thing. I wanted to see a little more from the villain though... We meet him once in the entire book and I can't even remember his name right now... He didn't really leave a big impression on me. The Shadowgrims are cool but they also don't play a big role yet. Maybe we'll get to see more of the bad guys in the sequel? Let's hope so!The story is well thought out. I do believe the author really took some time to work it all out, so that is good. But although it's interesting and quite original, is so slow. I would've liked to see more action, instead most of the book lucy is underground, hiding and training. Love the character developement we get from that, but it gets boring after a couple of hundred pages. I wanted more action! What I do like about that is the romance. It builds nice and slow. it's more realistic and it's not a big part of the story yet. But I think it will be in the books that follow. They probably shouldn't have called it romantic in the blurb, because it isn't that romantic yet.So this is a pretty good book and fans of the genre might like it. If you want a nice relaxing read, I recommend it as well. If you love books that move to the action quick, I wouldn't recommend it because this isn't one of those book. I really hope we get more action in the next book. The cover is awesome though."
"First, I must say that I won't be talking about the characters very much because I can't do that without spoilers and since this is an ARC copy, I won't spoil anything. So if you want to talk or rant or fangirl about this book and it's characters, please send me a message! I need someone to talk with about this book, lol.The S-word is the brilliantly written debut of Chelsea Pitcher and I can't help but ask... Where in God's name have you been hiding all this time Chelsea? Why did you keep your talent from us for so long? It should be punished... But this book is great, so you are forgiven.Yes, this is a great book. More then that. It's a must-read and one of my new favorites of this year. (Maybe even of all time.) The writing is great and I was hooked to the story from the first sentence. I could not stop reading. I just had to know how it ended. Like I said, I can't talk about it much because I don't want to spoil anything, but I have to say that it did not end the way I thought it would. There are twists and turns I did not see coming. Nothing is what it seems, that's all I can say.I wanted to talk about bullying because it's a big theme in this novel, but I won't. It's bad and mean and low. I hate bullies. That's all.This book is captivating, full of drama and even romance and suspence. Brilliantly written, like I already said and Chelsea, you've got a new fan. I can't wait to read more from you in the future."
"Seriously Dara, you never disappoint me. Every book of you I read, is awesome. That's the reason I agreed to beta this new series for you. I knew it would be great and I knew I would love it. That's why I said I would make room in my schedule for you anytime. Because you are an amazingly talented writer and I love you!So this story is about Kat, a were-leopard (really, those exist? Never heard of it before, but it's cool!) who grew up with a pack of werewolves. She has a secret relationship with the soon-to-be Alpha male of the pack, Jason. And he's the reason she has to leave. Because he can't claim her as his. Because of who she is, she can't be Alpha female. So she leaves everything behind.Seven years go by and she's build a new life with a normal human called Marc. But it doesn't last long. She meets other were-leopards and soon she finds herself in a whole lot of trouble. So she has to go back to her pack, because that's the only place she can be safe. That also means she has to see Jason again. And of course, trouble follows her as does passion, lust, love and more trouble.As I said already, the writing is great and I didn't expect less from Dara. I know she's very talented. She just has a way of making everything become more realistic. Not many authors can do that. Especially in this genre. I mean, paranormal romance with very specific erotic scenes? It's kind of hard to make it realistic. Especially when it's about were-leopards and werewolves. I loved the story too. It's original and really, really hot! And the romance is good too. Although I'm a bit split about which one I like the most. So you have Kat and Jason to begin with. They have a history and I get that. They grew up together and fell in love, so it's certainly the most believable. And it's not insta-love. And Kat does love him a lot, that is until James comes in her life. But first Marc. He is a human and they were together when she wasn't with the pack. He disappeared and I don't know what happened to him, but I hope I'll find out in the next book. She forgets him kind of quickly. And yes, James. They are the same in many ways and it's only normal they're attracted to each other and all that. But still... Kat was kind of quick with moving on from Jason and Marc and falling for James.I liked Kat, she's a cool character, but I did find her a bit annoying. You know, she's a real cat in heat and she jumps from one guy to the next (not literally) fairly quick and that annoyed me. She loved Jason first then she left. She loved Marc and ran back to the pack for her safety right into the arms of Jason once again and then stuff happens and there's James. So. But I liked her, she's got spunk and she's pretty stubborn, so that's cool. And I liked James too. Didn't see Marc that much, so I don't know about him yet. But Jason... I liked him, but I didn't get to know how that good. So I hope I get to know him better in the next book. And all the other characters are cool too.Thanks to Dara, for letting me beta-read this book. I'm starting the next book tomorrow! I recommend this to fans of the genre or people who love erotic romance novels with a paranormal twist. D.T. Dyllin is an awesome writer and I will read anything she writes because I know it will be good. So, D. Whenever you got new stuff to beta, don't ask, just send it to me okay?"
"I liked this book. The story was good, the characters also goo, the writing good. I was pleasantly surprised, to be honest. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.. I didn't really connect with the characters though... I don't know why... Even so, this was a nice read and maybe I will read it again in the future, who knows? I will be reading other books by this author for sure.I loved getting to know Maine. I didn't really knew that much about it, so I was happy to get such depth and detail of it's history, landscape and all that. I really loved that!Another thing I loved was the mystery in this book and how it unfolded. Maybe it's a weird thing to say, but I predictable but unpredictable. My head hurts trying to figure that one out. xDSo this is a good book and I liked it. But it wasn't more then that for me. Good, but not great. That's why I gave it 3.5 stars. Good job A.D.! I look forward to read more from you in the future."
"I really liked this book. I really did. It was original and I loved the mystery and the riddle Matty has to solve and I loved discovering it with him. This was a pretty good book.So this is the story of Matty. He's really smart. Seriously. I had a headache when he was talking or thinking smart things. Wendy did her research on that department. I liked the world she created and the references to this time. You know, the months, Yesa (I see what you did there Wendy, smart, really smart, lol.), That was really cool. So this smart guy doesn't like the school he goes to because the teachers are actually less smart then he is and he is bored all the time. So the King offers him a master's diploma but first he has to answer the question: What was January Black? It's a ship, but that's not the answer the King wants. So Matty has to figure out what January Black really was and I loved that we learned everything together with him. It kept me guessing and it was so fascinating. This was a really fascinating book.I loved Matty. Like I said, he gave me a headache every now and then, but I liked him. For some reason I kept hearing his voice in a British accent. Don't know why. I loved Iris and they were very cute together. It didn't feel forced and it was nice to see them grow as a couple. To see them fall in love with each other. I didn't know whether or not to like King Hadrian. Some times I did, then I didn't. Same with his dad. But I loved his mother.I don't exactly know what genre this is exactly. YA fantasy I think. So if you love that genre, you should read this book. If you don't, but you like books with mystery and smart guys that gives you a headache and sound British in your head, then you should read it too. I actually recommend it. The British accent thing. It's kind of sexy."
"So an omnibus... Never reviewed one before, so I'm glad I liked this one! At some points it felt like 1 really long book, which is good. It flowed nicely from one book to the next and that's very awesome in a book. I hate it when it just jumps from one thing to another and this book didn't do that.The writing was good, although sometimes a bit simplistic than I'm used to in this genre, but that's okay. There's great character developement, they all grow throughout the series and that's awesome. The magic in this book was really cool and the world building was very well done. The romance in this book was sweet and emotional and it really fit into the story without taking it over to much.If you're a fan of this genre, I really recommend these books. They are written good and the story's great. =)Yeah, I know this is a short review, but I can't talk much about it without spoilers since I'm reviewing three books at once. Just read it, okay?"
"3.5 starsI'm surprised to say that I really liked this book! It was a pretty cool and original concept and it worked out well. I found a few typos, but they didn't bother me that much. Kimberly gives her own spin on mermaids and sirens and mixed that with some cool action, fantastic underwater scenes and a passionate romance.Waterborn is about Caris. She just moved to a little town near the sea from Kentucky with her dad and she can't help but feel different here. Like the sea is calling her. And then she meets Noah, not knowing what he is. Noah is a waterbreather and he hears Caris' song in his head and he can't help but feel attracted to her. Soon enough, Caris finds out what and who she is. But is that really who she wants to be?The writing in this book was very good. I couldn't put this book down once I picked it up. I was pulled into Caris' world and wanted to find the answers to her questions just as much as she did. The story was cool and I got just the right amount of action and in the end my questions were answered. The romance was so sweet and passionate at the same time, I couldn't get enough of it.But despite the fact that there was some action, I never felt like it was enough. I kept waiting for something big, but it never really happened. And that took a bit from the story for me. I wanted more.I really liked Caris, she was a cool main character, but sometimes she annoyed me quite a bit. I can't even tell you why because I don't know. Maybe the way she acted around Noah in the beginning? And I liked Noah, he was sweet and he had some issues to deal with. And I got that. And it wasn't really insta-love between him and Caris because of the whole siren-song thing. I didn't like Sol and Pax, obviously. I loved Maggie and Erin and Caris' dad. I'm a bit conflicted about Athen, though. I'm not sure if I should like him or hate him.Overall, this is a good mermaid-ish story. Kimberly gave her own spin on it all and that was pretty cool but I finished the book wanting more. So yes, I have yet to find a book in this genre that completely blows my socks off. But I do recommend it, maybe you like it more than I did."
"This is a cute short book.  Very interesting the thinking of the time.  I found it a nice escape for one afternoon.  Not of this era it is nice look at the turn of the last Century.  Enjoy."
"it is a Good read.  It is an easy, comfortable read. Just complicated enough to keep one interested.  Hope others enjoy."
"I have been taking it for a long time now, its one of the best weight gainers I have had."
"Excellent and involving till the end. One of the most touching books I ever read in my life. I highly recommend it to everyone and especially to everyone who gave up on their dreams. This book will show you the way to your Personal Legend!The Alchemist involved me from the start. I read this book in one sip. Really, when I started I couldn't put it away till the last page. It might look like it's a novel, but if you read between the lines, you will notice that a novel is just a surface. What is really deep in this story is the personal journey to discover yourself and reach your dreams. I love the way Paulo Coelho presented this journey. I love to dream and reach my dreams, so all the stories about somebody having big dreams and achieving them touches me, especially this one.Santiago is the main character of the story. Actually he can represent everyone on the earth who follows his own dreams. He is just a symbol of will, persistence and victory of life. The story tells his journey to discover himself. Actually, he takes the road to follow his dreams which he saw when he was sleeping. The entire journey is a metaphoric transformation to discover yourself. I don't want to tell all the story here, but can say that everyone of us has our own journey in life. The question is do we take the road? Or do we swim with the river?This book made me understand that life consists of the journey to reach the dreams. It's not the end result that makes all the sense. It's the personal journey that makes it really mater. It's the Personal Legend that you create on the way to reaching your goals. Everything in life is really just a hand length away. The question is what length journey you have to go to see those things. You have to be ready to achieve success, otherwise it will pass through. The personal journey makes you ready when it comes. And this book has everything in it what you need to be a champion in life.So, can you read between the lines? Can you see more than just a trip to Egypt? Share your thoughts."
"Great book and guide on very important lessons in life. Most people struggle with their lives, jobs, relationships, happiness and so ever. I believe this book can really help most of them if they will read it sincerely for themselves and put those advises into action. The Greatness Guide is quite similar to another Sharma's book Who Will Cry When You Die. For me it wasn't much difference, but I believe that the more such books everyone will read, the more chances to live a great life he will have! Recommended to everybody searching greatness in all aspects of life!"
"Changes, changes, changes.. One of the most difficult things societies can handle. And one of the most important things in becoming successful in life as well! Most of you know people who are panicky afraid of something going even in a little different way than they are used to. Most of you know people who look with huge eyes when something changes and can't understand what to do now. Most of you are those people. And if you can't answer the question who moved your cheese, this book is really for you!Who Moved My Cheese is one of the first books I've read when I started to be interested in self-development and I'm very glad I've read it. Spencer did a great job by making this book sound as a story, really simple story that a child could read with an interest. That makes this book very easy to read and understand.The main problem discussed in the book is ""changes"" and how people react to it. By using four fictional characters in the story, author basically wants to show us four types of people in real life and four different reactions to the changes. After reading the material, everyone could personalize one of the characters to himself and that will show you where you are in life. Even though the story is fictional, the result in the end is real. Spencer shows real life consequences that happens to any of the characters according to their reaction and action to the changes.The book is really like a moral and I believe it's one of the most important morals in life, because I believe that based on your reaction to changes you get the certain results. On the other hand, certain results come from having a certain reaction to changes. So if you want to see what might happen to you, read this book, and it will be like a laboratory experiment looking at the mice and watching what happens to each of them based on their behavior.So, who are you in the story? Or maybe more important, who are you going to become after reading this book? Share your thoughts!"
"Very interesting and inspiring work on governance that could be used for leadership. It's a political treatise and even though this book was written about 500 years ago, all the principles described in the book works very well these days. A very interesting look at the reasons, methods and differences of the governance is presented.Niccolo Machiavelli wrote this treatise as a gift for his those days king. The reason to do so was to explore and to describe the methods on how to govern a country. Actually everything is very easy presented. The author starts by describing differences between the counties and then gets into how and why those counties or areas should be governed. The book is full of real life examples of other nations in different times. Machiavelli describes why some of the countries or empires expanded and why some of them collapsed. Everything is easy explained and it's not difficult to notice, that most of the methods he wrote about are used by today politicians or leaders.As I've read a lot of books on leadership, this one was really interesting because of its age. Actually it might look like this book is more about management, but really there are a lot of hints and methods that turns on to leadership. Furthermore, firstly kings had to be leaders to keep the power in their hands.Moreover, what I liked more about this book, is a deeper look and understanding on how countries are created, what agreements you should make and what you shouldn't do to win. The book revealed many intrigues between kings and their relatives, which led to betrayals and deaths. To conclude everything, I think that the most important thing is not to get the power - it's to keep it for a lifetime and to be remembered as the greatest!Any thoughts? Please, share."
"I love you.I am sorry.Please forgive me.Thank you.That's all you need to attract wealth, health and peace of your mind.These four simple sentences make it all. This entire book is rotating around them and the main idea is to reach the level of zero limits, which means you can do everything at that point. The book describes Hawaiian belief system called Ho'oponopono, which is kind of religion, just don't have any gods. It's the system of cleaning yourself from any kind of bad thoughts, habits, actions and so on. Even if it looks simple, it's not so simple to use it properly. The first thing you have to do is to take all responsibility for anything coming into your life for yourself. Only by taking it, you have a change to get results practicing this system.The book is written by the man very well-known from the movie ""The Secret"" - Joe Vitale. Author describes his experience about getting to know this mysterious method. The book is based on his relationship with Dr Hew Len, the expert of this system.Personally, my first reaction after starting to read this book was really strange. I couldn't understand much that was written in the beginning and it seemed that it's just a nice story, like a novel. I even started to think to quit on reading this book, what I never do. The first thing that caught my attention and kept me on reading was when I read that Ho'oponopono is a Hawaiian system. I love Hawaii, so I decided to keep on reading till the end. Page after page and I really got involved in the book. I started to analyze and think that it might be true, even if it looks mysterious and too simple to be true.I'm not practicing this method intensively now, still I think about it quite often and sometimes try Ho'oponopono system. It's strange, but I think it's working, just I think I need more time to experience the results. Another thing that I started to love is Ho'oponopono music. First times listening it might seem strange, but latter it brings peace to your mind.If you love Hawaii or searching something different in your life I believe you should read Zero Limits. It's one of the philosophies of this beautiful island."
"Find answers to some of the most interesting and important questions of how human mind works! Discover reasonable explanations to the most mystical and magical things like paranormal faculties, hypnosis, telepathic, voodoo, auras, shamans, miracles and many more.I should admit that Mind Dynamics was one of the most interesting books I've recently read. This book really gave me a lot of information on many things that are called mystical or miraculous in our society. I got many answers and still many more questions left for the future studies and readings. This book covers many such topics, but basically it's about our brain and how it works. Moreover, and what is very important, it's about how we can use that knowledge about our mind to improve our abilities and lives!Some things in our society are taken for granted and some are considered as mystics or miracles. That is just a lack of information and in most cases just a lack of knowledge, which is actually already researched at some levels and could be available for everyone. Author really made a great work on researching many of the information on such topics as voodoo, shamanism, hypnosis, self-hypnosis, suggestions, consciousness, faith, healing, miracles, autosuggestion, brain waves and many more similar phenomenons. I personally believe that all mystical phenomenons can be explained in a rational way and this book gave me very valuable information that I am not wrong.Another great thing is that this book is full of explanations and guidelines about using many techniques and methods in order to establish or improve our abilities that will definitely influence our lives. Christian gives detailed information about how to use them correctly. That is a great thing, because this book can be used practically as well.Compared to other books on human mind, Mind Dynamics is really very informative, practical, quite technical, and well historically researched. It will give you scientific explanations to many unusual phenomenons and most important it will help you to understand how and why your own mind works. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about their own brain, who wants to improve their abilities and mostly for those who still believe in crystal ball.Do you believe in what you see or do you see what you believe in?"
"How much do you like yourself? Do you like what you do? How you look like? How you live? Are you the person you are wishing to be? Is your life going in the best way that could be for you? If not, then who is responsible for your life? The answer is simple - YOU ARE!As A Man Thinketh will make you rethink your life. It's a book about any human's view to life. What/Who is creating you? Is there any circumstance which makes your life as it is, or is that you - yourself? Although many people are thinking that their life is based on many different circumstances, it's not true. You are the only one who creates those circumstances around you. The simple answer is that there are actions and there are outcomes. Certain actions create certain results in your life and those actions begin with your thoughts. The circumstances just make your actions sharper.I agree with the author for one hundred percent. We are what we are thinking every day, what is deep in our hearts. One of the sayings is that &amp;#34;Money spoils people&amp;#34;. It's not true. Money just makes people to be more visual for who they really are. If person is good in his heart and thoughts, no money will make him evil, but if he is not, everything will make him bad.The good news is that we can change everything with no additional circumstances or features. We can change our lives just by starting to think in a different direction. It will require will, persistence and patience, but that's the only way to do that. If you are happy with your life, great! If not, if there is anything that you are not happy about in your life, you will need the advises from this book. Don't wait, any hesitation will have certain results and probably you won't be happy about them.Are you creating yourself that you admire and are proud of?"
"Still interested in utopia worlds? Then this book is for you. For me? No, thank you. Utopia books make me wanna shout ""wake up""!The more I read about utopia societies, the more I love this world and the more it seems to be the best world to live in. Just finished reading the book The City Of The Sun by Tommaso Campanella and it really seems like a copy of Utopia by Thomas More, which I read couple months ago. The style of writing and the way author express himself through the material is very interesting considering the century it was written. Though, Tommaso was absolutely familiar with the More's treatise Utopia, and the style of both books is similar not accidentally. Sincerely, I like the ""original"" Utopia more.If you still don't consider our world to be utopia and still dreaming about living in those fiction utopias it's a great book for you to read. What really made me think reading this book is that Tommaso builds his City of the Sun on the society he actually lived in. It seems that utopia is just what actually exists but everything that is considered bad is removed and everything considered good is magnified. That's it, nothing more nothing less. Moreover, the religion is exaggerated what is strange having in mind modern utopias that really denies religion. But having in mind the century the book was written (more than 400 year ago), probably it's the norm.In addition, The City Of The Sun really look like a mix of the modern days authors' books' The New Brave World and 1984. Not considering technologies, just taking the society's lifestyle and traditions, it really looks having characteristics similar to both of the modern novels. And still I don't love the robotized society. Even though the book describes happy people, I still don't see any personalities and any sense of their existence, but probably that's the point of utopia world.I just want to make some analogues to our world. One of them is that society in the book is so busy doing everyday activities that people don't even have time to realize themselves and their actual needs or existence. They are blindly following the order of the state, the formed needs and formed happiness. Sadly, but our world is the same. Most people are so busy doing everyday routine activities, following formed opinions and needs that are basically not their own. It seems the same robotic. The good thing is that in our world we can wake up, we have everything we need to do so and if utopia dreams doesn't make you more robotic, if you feel somehow that you need to escape from sleeping life, one of the best books to read is Why You're Dumb, Sick and Broke...And How To get Smart, Healthy and Rich by Randy Gage.If you have some additions or different opinion, please, share and discuss it together!"
"Old idea and old book, even though, the ideas are still very alive these days. One of the most influencing humanism works written 500 years ago by Thomas More. I like the book but I miss the point of creating utopia world. What about you?Interesting thing but the word ""utopia"" came from this book as we know it now. Thomas created it in this book by describing in his mind the ideal society, ideal place and ideal life. Utopia is written in a story style and that makes it very easy to read and understand. Recently I've read some other books describing opposite to utopia, which is called anti-utopia. It was very interesting to see the differences between all of them.Utopia is a fictitious place and the author describes it as an ideal place for society to live. Based on fictitious story teller he describes many different aspects of life like cities, authorities, crafts, communication, relationships, trips, slaves, war and belief. What I didn't like is that through my eyes many things are based on Christianity or has some color of it. That makes me to think that basically this utopia society is based on emotional and not reasonable aspects.Me personally I'm not admiring the idea of utopia. I think it has many disadvantages. What caught my eye is that in this book there is not mentioned some really important aspects like passion (in any ways like sexual, activity and even life). Sometimes this book reminded me Brave New World. It's similar that in utopia nobody possess nothing and in Brave New World everyone else belongs to everyone else. It doesn't really much differ in mindset, just in surface. What I really doesn't admire in utopias is that they deny personality and destroys character only leaving human as a small part of society. It seems that you can change any two people with places and nothing will change or have any difference. It's possible that in many cases the same would happen in our world, but here at least we have a chance. Actually I think utopia might be more admired by those, who want somebody else to do more for their good.Most utopias tries to make people equal, but it's not right, because happiness is not equal and it can't be. Everyone's happiness is different that means you can't give everyone the same things and expect that they will react the same, because people should want different things in life. People shouldn't be computers programmed by the same program. I think that we are living in quite an utopia world. Everyone who is not programmed by memes (or even is) has different wishes and understands happiness differently. And the most beautiful thing is that everything is possible in our world nowadays. Everything except what your mind limits you from.So, isn't this an utopia world? What do you think?"
"Sometimes it seems that your life is a mess? Or maybe it's more often than just sometimes.. There could be some reasons for that and I believe that some of them could be solved by reading and implementing the principles which are found in The Four Agreements.I didn't read this book, I listened to the audio version of it and I think there is no difference while you are getting the wisdom being presented to you. I listened to it maybe five times and going to do it many more times. That's one of the advantages while driving the car: you can use your time wisely and get some self-development happening!I should admit that some similar information I've got earlier from other books. What I love the most about audio version of this book is that information is presented in a story telling manner what makes it very interesting to listen. This book made me look to everything in my life from another angle. The author presents four simple, but very powerful agreements that can really change your life. I'm still practicing to get used to those principles. Even it's simple to understand, it's more difficult to implement. On the other hand, the examples make it all easier.Have you ever thought about human domestication? Well, if you never did, than after listening/reading The Four Agreements you will understand that we are not any different than any other living beings on this planet. And we are domesticated to be humans, so it might be that most of us really don't even know what it really means to be a human. We are humans just the way we are taught to be humans.Back to four agreements, you will be surprised how obvious they can be. Most of them you are using everyday, unfortunately mostly in a wrong manner. I don't want to write them here, because just writing them without explanation would be meaningless. I greatly recommend this book to everyone who wants more balance, peace and freedom in their life. I believe this book will cause you to think if you are prepared to look at everything what you've been taught from another angle.Does domestication program that you've got help you in your life?"
"One of those movies that make you feel so small in this world. If you like special effects, it's a film for you. This movie is packed with them and great fighting scenes of huge monsters and robots. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it's not one of those movies you could watch over and over again. As I mentioned it has a beautiful special effects, but the story line is not very strong. The idea is simple, somebody attacks the Earth and people start to fight for themselves. It's just a standard hero movie with great development and implementation of special effects."
"They were very stylish to each outfit i used them with. They were very cool i liked them a lot."
"I have an older kindle and love to play games. this game is a lot of fun!! I cant wait to try all the others I downloaded today!"
"I absolutely love this agenda. It is super pretty and it has plenty of space to write. It is a perfect size, not too big not too small, and I love how the front and back flaps have a fold which allows you to store/bookmark pages.I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be better if it had a full month view at the beginning of each month and the material of which its made of can cause the ink to smear depending on what type of pen you use."
"I work 12+ hrs a day with 4 computer monitors so these glasses where definitely a must have. They definitely help with the glare and at the end of the day I don't have a headache or feel that my eyes are burning! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they tend to get really dirty and the cloth they come with doesn't really clean them well."
"When purchased I thought this was a game. Please cancel. A detailed description or a demo screen could prevent the need to cancel soon after placing order."
"Terrible do not like it at all BAD NEWS FOR YOUR PLAYING DID NOT ENJOY AT ALL BAD BAD BORING  ;-(((("
"FUN and fast to play ....... especially when I want to think in reverse. I referred this game to my friend."
"Not a fun game Disappointed is an understatement. ICK made many purchases not happy with any of them  at all."
"Enjoyed very much. The instructions were easy to understand  and fun to play.  But I did not like some of the choices ."
"Do not like this game at all.  I had to give 1 star and actually I'd give it MINUS 1. Can I get a credit refund."
"My 14 year old grandson must have ordered this. I'll have to ask him if he found his LOVE MATCH"
"Don't like this game at all.  Have not been satisfied with recent orders. I think I'm going to stop ordering. :-("
"Love this books! I've loved reading these online and its even better with all of them in the book and the commantary!"
"Beautiful necklace and a really great price, good for any lover of Celtic jelwery. The other products are beautiful as well."
"Computer was getting super hot, this helped a ton. It take up a lot of room so be wary if already cramped for space, but it does it job for sure."
"Good tie, rich orange color if that what you need. Good for prom or a wedding with an orange color scheme."
"Does its job really well and doesn't clutter up a USB port doing it. Stays strongly secured in the back of the case, so not really a worry of bumping it."
"The green will get dirty over time, but for the price it is well worth it. Protects the phone, and the color looks great."
"If you love family guy, and/or Brian you will love this little guy. Cute and cheap and doesn't take up too much space."
"It's light weight and very comfortable. Can be used for daily use or just on occasion, or even for cosplay."
"Super cute! Looks just as the picture shows and is really durable. Doing dues take awhile though, so plan accordingly."
"The picture book is about a kangaroo being pursued by dingoes. Will the kangaroo be able to escape the pack of hungry animals?The author, Margot Finke is from Australia. She incorporates the religious beliefs of the people from the Aboriginal culture and information about the other wildlife and the environment into the story in an entertaining way.There are footnotes on many of the pages that give more factual information which will be helpful to older kids wanting to learn more about the culture.The illustrations by Mustafa Delioglu capture the mystical and exciting feeling of the story very well."
"I like this book a lot because it will inspire kids to be like Bella and do whatever they can to help the environment. There's some good information about how to do that at the end of the story."
"Kevin Collier is a talented illustrator and this book is as cute and charming as his others. The story is simple and would be great to read to preschoolers, especially kids who love to draw and paint or are interested in sea life. It also has a sweet message and will help kids realize they, themselves, are valuable works of art."
"The colors we received are the same as shown above. They seem to be decent quality. My 5 year old is a little tall for her age and weighs about 57 pounds. She usually wears size 7 so I got medium thinking they would be a tad big so she could wear them a little longer. She won't be able to wear these for probably another year because the neckline droops down past her chest. The bottom goes down a little past her belt line, so it's not too long or too short. They fit very loosely around her body. I would definitely buy these again, only a size smaller."
"The colors I received are as shown above. The material is very thin, which is what I expected. I wear a size 9 1/2 in women's shoes and they stretch well to fit me. I'm not sure if these will last too long due to the thin material but they are comfortable."
"This is a great replica of the knife used in The Hunted. Good weight. fairly well balanced. Happyt to have it!"
"One is huge fan of certain songs, and yet others make one's hair stand on end...and all on the same CD. Safe to say something for everyone."
"It is a Great movie. To truly get the whole movie experience , the viewer should watch the tv episode of The Original Series, The Space Seed, .It is the prequel ofthe movie.But even if the viewer does not, the move is still awesome."
"This product is awesome! My pup has Hip Dysplasia and his orthopedic doctor recommended it for his condition. So, we tried it , and his condition improved dramatically. We are very happy."
"like the style of this shirt  but too big"
"again find this shirt fits too big  would have liked to try on first  one of the disadvantage of purchasing on line"
"Got this case before I realized that it doesn't fit the Kindle Fire. Very disappointed about that. Shipped from Hong Kong, so not gonna return. I'm sure it's a great little case for the tablet it's supposed to fit!!"
"I absolutely love this case! It keeps my Kindle safe and looks nice. It stands up just fine, unless it's on a slippery surface. I'd recommend this case to anyone!"
"Got my son a Kindle Fire for Christmas. He's let me play with it about three times now. This is the first game I got to play on it. I'm addicted!! It's a great game!! Gonna put it on my Kindle Fire HD I ordered!!"
"Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Perfect size to slip in her pocket and go!! Gonna buy her another ipod next (so she can get online and send txt and things.)"
"The rear window visibility of my smart fortwo convertible was a bit claustrophobic. I looked into a lot of aftermarket backup camera solutions and stumbled upon this. Buying the 11&amp;#34; x 14&amp;#34; size, I cut it in half horizontally, flipped the top half upside down and stuck it to the bottom of the back window. It now completely obsoletes both side mirrors; it is dramatically wider in both directions and leaving virtually no blind spot. The fortwo is the perfect car for this product because the rear window has very little slant and no ass-end sticking out, so there is neither distortion nor obstruction. Because I left a gap in the top of the window, I can still tell when a car is very close to me.Twelve bucks and no hassle, you can't go wrong with this.I'm also recommending it for the hospital I work at, it makes it much easier for staff to check on patients. Doors with a 1'x1' view port can have this stuck to it and you can see everyone in the room at a glance."
"thought the stones were beautiful but dissappointed in the looks of the band , looks like cheap plastic no i would not recommend this to anyone i know"
"don't know why it charge like over 10 hours..hard to see green light for couple of hours... it's way too much more time consuming than phone charging itself... so disappointed.."
"Good Call is very good book! Tremendous read! It's nice to read more about Jason Robertson and his family.Awesome book!"

"The features of this projector seem to be limitless.  The projector practically sets up itself.  Also light and extremely portable."
"Fits well, looks great and is so cheap compared to buying it at a store in australia. Would recommend to my friends."
"First make up I have used that does not cause me acne problems. Love this make! Looks and feels natural!!!"
"Thought this was a great action packed read.from start to finish it told the story of father and son and its bond even if they don't agree with each other."
"I did not get the cases that show on here. Instead I got thin cases that do not protect my phone at all. I'm usually happy with my orders but this one I was not happy about at all because of the fact that I got totally different cases then I expected."
"Really great tunes to sing to.  Many of our favorite Christian contemporary hits.  So nice to be able to belt these out rather than some of the secular music that bring you down."
"As this story offers its as analysis of the Passion of Christ it illuminates parts  of if, confounds others, and merely relays others. Toibin holds up as mirror for us to see ourselves as we recall those events and challenges our comfort in the story. A wonderful reflection and should be required reading for all to know Mary's humanity."
"Twisting the barrel to turn off is too easy to go even farther and place it in the &amp;#34;remove battery&amp;#34; position.  Not a critical failure but annoying.Does not pull hairs and is comfortable.In order to remove from package I recommend: plasma cutter, crowbar, and a circular saw."
"It is as nice as I expected.  Detailed, well made and substantial.  I like the combination of brass and pewter."
"I think this app makes you more independent. It also makes you want to  keep trying to pass the level you are on. Personally this game is awesome. Honestly I think the game makers should get more money then usual for these reviews."
"By far the most fun car to run and very durable in my opinion. Customer service is great as well."

"I have used it for 3 weeks. Although I did not check my weight, my belly is obviously smaller than before.It really boost up energy. And the good thing is I do not notice any side effects which is rare for fat burn products."
"Cute but lost its color after one use. Will purchase again maybe I will put clear polish next time first."
"Absolutely brilliant. Nothing more. Nothing less. Exact words,written as if extracted from my subconscious ""darkness"" ....I loved this book. Obviously."
"Beware of other daisy screens which feature a stem, the stem tends to get in the way of the bowl hole if you will. These screens did not have a stem and worked great for my use. Usage 8-14 sessions a day."
"Great book! I recommend this! At first it's a little weird. But DONT STOP READING!! it gets better!! ;) (;"
"Mrs. Whitten read The Phantom Tollbooth to my fifth grade class about forty years ago.  I moved before hearing the ending.  The only thing I remembered from the story was the Island of Conclusion.  At the time, I didn't know what ""jumping to conclusion"" meant, but it got stuck in my memory.The Phantom Tollbooth is as fun to read at fifty years of age as it was to hear it read to me in the fifth grade.  I can appreciate it's educational value now which was lost on me as a child.  The story is a light and easy read with not so subtle reference to numbers, letters, time, character building, and more."
"This is a good book for me personally. It helped answer a lot of questions i had and couldn't make since of. It is a very good resource for someone like me who is new to the craft. I really enjoyed this book."
"This is actually a very good book. I originally bought his thinking it was about the elementals of the watchtowers...it is not. so i was disappointed. but i did read it and has been put to use more then some of my other books. I would recommend for beginners..since this book talks about the elements of earth,fire,water,air...(not elementals)"
"This is a very good book. I have to admit i have read quite a few moon books but this is definitely one you would want of your new to the patth and need a fast easy understanding of moon magick"
"I would recommend this book to any level of a triathlete. Seasoned veteran or beginner. Chrissie is such a tough competitor but absolutely loves what she does and doesn't forget that! Which some of us forget! Truly a great book!"
"It was a light read and fun being able to relate to a lot, almost all, of his stories! Makes me love this sport even more!"

"One of the most incredible parts of the film is when one of the SEALS takes a foldable, seemingly toy airlplane from his pack, turns the prop and sends it flying over the enemy.  The airplane, then takes photos of all the buildings and terrain and transmits them back to an Aircraft Carrier, which then directs the strike."
"Cheap. The whole thing is made of really hard plastic and it seems as though it may fall apart at any moment. Sadly, I bought it as a baby shower gift and was pretty embarrassed once we opened it up and put it together. Do yourself a favor spend a little extra $$ and get a decent one!"
"when I first started taking this it seemed to be working pretty well. I lost 5 pounds in about 2weeks, but I also eat very healthy and I work out almost daily.  So that  didn't exactly send me to the moon or anything but it was definitely encouraging. I started out taking the 3pills a day like it says, and I got SEVERLY constipated. So I cut back to one a day and slowly worked my way back up. The consipation comes and goes now but its There more often than not. I've been taking this product now for almost a month and not only have I not lost an ounce, I gained back the 5 pounds that I lost. It doesn't seem to be doing anything at all at this point. Which is dissapointing because I have struggled with my weight for so long even though I eat right and exercise so I thought this could be the answer I was searching for but sadly, i have found that the old saying holds true, if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. I will continue to take the pills until they are gone just in case I suppose but overall I'm not really pleased. Especially for the $$"
"Head arrived on time was as described.  We use these for work puropses and they hold up to the beating of hard all day use very well."
"I went to a flea market on South Water Street in Providence this past weekend and purchased a bar of Lavender goats milk soap from Legend's Creek Farm. As soon as I picked it up I could tell it was going to make your skin feel so smooth! I could not wait to use it- It is absolutely amazing. Your skin feels smooth for a while and it makes you smell great! I also loved how it had bits and pieces in it that's good for exfoliating! One more thing- I didn't realize the farm was located in Foster, I live in Glocester and finding local products is the best feeling in the world. I highly recommend these products."
"I love this game. The only thing I would ask the makers to change is to make it so youre able to start a new game. I've deleted and downloaded it 3 times already (only had to pay once) just so I could play again once I finished it. If the makers are reading this please make an update that allows you to play again so that I so that I don't have to keep deleting and redownloading"
"I live in Paris and i am very pleased to buy those lovely Australian, such expensive in France. My daughter is 12 years old and she absolutely fall in love with her new boots!!! See you next time for other shoes delivered in the USA when I'm coming for work."
"Really comfortable! Super soft and warm. Also a great fit, very snuggly good for those winter months of just lounging around in your house."
"I love these shoes.  They match my daughter's uniforms beautifully.  I ordered the wide size, as other reviewers stated that these shoes would be narrow otherwise.  I believe that they were correct, as the wide size does fit perfectly."
"Great book....I would highly recommend it. I wish I would have tried out for the teams. Never read a book in such a short amount of time"

"Overall not a bad product.  Wish it came with the garter hosiery.  The arm bands are pretty weak  but overall,  it's OK."
"Somewhat predictable, but historically and geographically accurate, good story lines with families and cross family developments, recommend for a light reading."
"This was a great selection and was very affordable. This same battery would have cost me $50 at my wireless phone company. Thanks for the time and money saved. Two thumbs up!!!"
"extremely satisfied with this purchase.the stories are of unique nature.Salinger does not write like o henry or somerset maughamThanks"
"Sapphique is a dystopian/science fantasy book by author Catherine Fischer, and is the sequel to the first book in the Incarceron series, Incarceron. The book is about a hero Finn, whom has escaped the prison of Incarceron, leaving behind his friends Kiero, and Attia. Upon his return, Finn finds that his stepmother is trying to prevent him from becoming king, and the warden of Incarceron has become trapped in the prison himself. The daughter of the Warden has become infatuated with proving Finn to be the lost heir to the throne and rightful king. Finn, and Claudia's life are put into Finn's hands based upon his ability to convince the courts that he is indeed the lost heir to the throne.There were quite a few aspects of this book that I enjoyed about this book. The story was filled with an amazingly large amount of content for the reader, but moved at such a fast pace, while giving excellent descriptions of what was going on. The use of imagery was actually quite excellent. For example when there was a description given of the glove of Incarceron, it was as if you could actually see the glove levitating right before you. Although the book had a wealth of quality content that I found to my liking, there were a few things that I didn't enjoy so much. For example, one thing that I didn't enjoy in the book was the dialogue, interaction, and actions of some characters. The dialogue for one, was quite confusing at time. Also, I found Kiero, and Attia's relationship quite dull, as there seemed to be a sense stagnancy to the romantic side of their relationship. It seemed as though their relationship was more mutualistic for their survival while Incarceron, rather than as a couple whom loved each other. Also I found that the actions of the warden's daughter, Claudia were quite unorthodox. Although this was a science fantasy book, I still can't grasp why she would cling to Finn so much, even when he showed disdain for her following, and affection. However, she was still an important character as far as the development of the overall story.Despite the unorthodox actions of the characters, with their odd interactions, dialogue, and all I found this book to be unsurprisingly excellent. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fantasy, and dystopias, of course. If Catherine Fischer did choose to write another book for the Incarceron series, I would read it without hesitation, because Sapphique is a quality read, that was enjoyed greatly by myself."
"This turtle is so cute! My daughter loves it very much!"
"It's very easy to use and clean. The color of this item is warm and cute."
"I recently bought 2 cameras and I am very happy with them. Setup was pretty simple and it works well with my email account, it's a decent camera with a decent web interface that does what it's supposed to do and works reliably, supports modern features and multiple users can be configured with different access levels.The pen and tilt moves almost silently, and are quick and precise. The LEDs on the rear panels can be disabled to be less conspicuous, in a nice touch.I really love these cameras so far. They are good budget priced cameras and other cameras with an image that's no better and software that's much worse are priced much higher. It's a great balance of modern features and decent quality."
"I was very happy with the trucks. They were used to hold snacks at a &amp;#34;construction&amp;#34; party for my grandson.  Afterwards they worked well in the sandbox."
"I found  myself nodding my head an  laughing out loud.  Uncomfortably honest at times.  I like this woman a lot!  But then I have always loved to be around crazy ass bitches."
"I purchased the same seat 6 years ago at another outlet.  The seat has served me tremendously well.  While there has been some tarnishing on the metal hinge parts, I regularly clean with white vinegar and baking soda and it looks like new again.  I am remodeling 2 bathrooms and I have ordered these same toilet seats again.  This toilet seat will compliment any decor with an understated elegance, I received plenty of compliments when guests visit the powder room."
"I like playing poker to unwind after a long day from work.Also pretty simple to play the game. Thank you!"

"This book is exactly what has been missing for leadership in churches around the world.I read the whole book in the duration of one flight, and I finished feeling encouraged and agreeing 100%.I've known and admired the ministry of Benny Perez for many years now, and this book captures his heart and energy perfectly.The ideas and concepts in this manuscript are spot on to what I believe the spirit of God is saying to this generation while also respecting and embracing the practicalunderstandings of the 21rst century.I'd recommend this book to anyone in leadership looking for the perfect balance for the day we live in.Wonderful book!"
"I was looking for cal king burgundy sheets, basically a rich merlot color to match the rest of my bedroom. I am also a sheet snob a prefer cotton sheets with a high thread count.These looked ideal, then they arrived. The color is the exact same color as a raspberry or a dark pink - far from what I was looking for or expecting from the photo. They are not burgundy. One of the pillow cases had a hole the size of a silver dollar in the seam, the texture is okay at best. We used the sheets for a few weeks, I wash my bedding every week, and noticed the spots where my husband and I lay the fitted sheet started to turn white and wore very quickly and very poorly. I threw them out, giant waste of money."
"My daughter LOVED the design and the ease of putting it on and taking it off when needed. Once ordered(at not on Prime) it was here in 4 days! Love this product and will order from this seller again, now that all four of my kids have iPods or phones!"
"These are a pretty good option if you want some cheap headphones fast, they work great, have a nice design, although their not my favorite type of headphones, I still like them quite a bit."
"This couch was delivered broken it will only flat as a bed and  the back will not lock as a couch.  the drill holes did not match so the legs did not fit either"
"I love them, I just wish they fit in my ear a little better like ear buds. They are great for working out because they don't fall out if my ears and cords don't rip them out."
"I was looking for a cheap mouse that has a changeable DPI and this is exactly what I was looking for. Works a lot better than most 30 dollar Logitech mouses one other brands similar to those."
"Great knife for the price....not crazy about the serated edge but overall a good knife for anyone looking for a good affordable all around knife."
"It is a great idea, but this product is poorly made and only turns on when it feels like it. Might at well try a different pillow remote."
"Very intriguing story and I couldn't put the book down.Lynn Austin remains my favourite author.I have introduced her books to friends and family members and they were just as excited about her books."
"it is addictive game just wish it had power-ups like some of the other bingo games but other than that its a good game"
"I bought this lotion about 3 months ago. I REALLY like this lotion, it smells like Tommy Hilfiger (so good) I get really dark after I use this. I would def. reccemond this to anyone. When I'm out of this lotion I will buy it again. You will not be discouraged."
"I bought this for my boyfriend and I's one year for him. He loves it as do I. I am thinking about getting myself one. It is kind of big but the sizes are correct for 4 X 6 pictures. I would recemmond this to anyone that needs a gift idea or something just to hang in there house. You HAVE to hang it on a wall. It will not just sit up some where. Its adorable and I love it."
"This case is really perfect for me. It arrived in 3 business days in a cheap &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34; wrapping, but the case was much higher in quality than its wrapping. It has a nice, smooth feel and there are no flaws in the stitching. All the holes are perfect in size, my headphone jack can still be easily used, I can access the charger through the case, and the camera's lense isn't obscured or anything by the case. I haven't dropped my iPod Touch yet, but I'm much less paranoid about it falling now (before the case arrived, I kept the loop on my hand and sat directly on my carpet, bed, or other soft surface that wouldn't hurt my device if I dropped it). This case keeps it very secure and I can still hold onto it with the iPod's loop.I got my case in red to match my iPod Touch and I recommend buying cases that match the iPod's color, unless you love purple or orange. I really think the seller had the shades made so that they're like a perfect match, baby pink looks about the same color as a pink iPod Touch 5th gen, and so on. The matching colors of the iPod and case look spectacular! Overall, this is a very nice case with a great feel to it and good protection too! I'm very satisfied with my purchase; this case is everything I could really ask for."
"Excelente producto, es una herramienta muy vers&amp;aacute;til y de f&amp;aacute;cil uso, mi casa qued&amp;oacute; super espectacular, se los recomiendo a mi madre le encant&amp;oacute;."
"I chose this rating because they are practical and work relatively well for at least being seen by drivers however I would not ride and rely solely on the front light to see which you would expect for this price.  The one pitfall I came across was when fitting it onto my bike, the attachments or at least the screws were relatively small and I had to replace them with longer ones.  All in all, well worth the money spent"
"I bought this phone for my father for Christmas it was awful!!!!! The camera didnt work, it was cracked and broken in multiple different places. When we brought it to the apple store they told us someone had replaced the screen, so it was no longer and apple display and they couldn't even replace the phone!!! Can not be used at all and was SUCH a waste of money. And NOW, trying to return it is impossible!Don't east your money. These @ssholes are just going to rip you off. TRUST me!"
"Great movie. Pretty okay, standard blu ray. Which I am fine with. Some of the older ones are pretty similar but the movie is awesome and I'm glad to have it on blu ray now."
"Great series, and an even better set. Great extras and really cool packaging. A must buy for all Alien fans."
"I love Bruce Willis and Halle Berry ain't so bad herself. I even like that little weaselly guy... Ben Foster? I think so... anyway good movie. Not a bad thriller."
"Great album, great condition when it got here. The best track is #1, Mountain Man. Check it out and thank me later."
"Definitely not the best or worse season of TOS as I have heard from some people. There were only three seasons so I don't know really how to pick a least favorite but if I had to it wouldn't be this one. Or 1 or 2 either... but I digress. Great season of a great show that ended before it should have. My one complaint is that it was '69 and they got cancelled so there isn't really a series finale which is sad because it would have been a good one I'm sure. And it would have made the beginning to Star Trek: The Motion Picture even better. Oh well, still amazing!"
"The gloves look and feel very nice but are not built to last.  I rode only 200 miles with these gloves before I had to purchased new gloves. After the first ride the seems start to come apart.  I wouldn't recommend these gloves"
"Fotorama Johnny The Skull Skill And Action GameDo not buy this product, broke in 5min waste of money I do not recommend to anyone"
"A very good book. Love the mystery. Probably now one of my favorite books. I plan to read more books by this author"
"If you know nothing about QFD, or you have had a training course, and now have to start working in the real world this book is for you. It realy does as the title says. Take you step by step throught the whole process. The layout and example are clear and helpful."
"I have more than 30 headphones ranging from 100-800 dollars including different sennheisers, AKGs, Audio technica, bose and ete. I can say this is the best sounding headphones ever. I even like the sound of it better that HD700.The sound of it without amp is perfect and with amp is even better. The treble and mids are perfect.  The bass is sepctacular. Better than any other headphones. IMO the BASS is better than Beats, Bose and Sonys.Fantastic little cans. Just consider it's portability, shouldn't be called the best headphones???!!! For those who want to compare it with Grado S60i and S80i, those are neven even not close to this and are not very portable.I think this is the best you can get around 100$ and IMO up to 800$."
"This little cans can suprise you how good they sound. The base is superb for the tiny headphones, very portable"
"Love the Bluetooth keyboard and the fact it's pink. I've seen compatible items in stores for double the money but the colors are limited.  Don't like how my tablet isn't fully secure inside. It needs for corner supports,  not two."
"I am new to the computer and have a lot of pictures I wish to protect. This scanner will do  small pictures, negatives andslides. I have read the directions (I am new to this) and find them hard to follow."
"We are in a time and a generation that focus' so much on the self. The desire to discover oneself, or to find oneself, or create oneself is advertised all around us. Which leaves us with the question. &amp;#8220;What if people do not like who I truly am?&amp;#8221; we ask ourselves. So we create a someone that we think everyone will like. As soon as that happens, there is no backing out. We must not only pretend to live that life, but we must make the stories more adventurous; describe ourselves as more free. We are left fighting against our own lies.Lomas describe the ways in which we create ourselves or see ourselves:You&amp;#8217;re a mom. A dad. A child of divorce. A business owner or a freelancer. Male, female, black, white. You&amp;#8217;re an introvert, an extrovert, a person who refuses to be labeled as either. You&amp;#8217;re gay, you&amp;#8217;re straight. You&amp;#8217;re a success, a failure, someone who never lived up to others people&amp;#8217;s expectations, or someone no one ever believed in. you control your own destiny or you cannot seem to escape the labels other people give you (Lomas, 27).He continues&amp;#8230;If you don&amp;#8217;t know the truest thing about yourself, you don&amp;#8217;t know yourself. And that matters. What you believe about yourself determines how you live. We were made for something. Something bigger than the little things we seem fated to surround ourselves with (Lomas, 32-33).So then, what is that &amp;#8220;thing?&amp;#8221; I believe, as does Lomas, that Genesis tells us this quite clearly:So God created man in His own image; He created him in the image of God (Genesis 1:27).We don&amp;#8217;t find our identity. Rather, we receive our identity. We are given it by God (Lomas, 69).Lomas wants his readers to know that the voices that tell you that you are not good enough and that you must create something more unique are not the truest thing about you. In fact most are lies created in your head.The fact is that you are a beloved child of God and He sees nothing but Christ&amp;#8217;s perfection in you. This frees you to be who you are with no fear. You do not need to create yourself. The pressure is gone. You can now live free as the beloved. All those voices evaporate as the Father says &amp;#8220;You are a child of mine.&amp;#8221;  He does not need your acting. No. He just wants you as you are. Fasten the &amp;#8220;Belt of truth around every morning.&amp;#8221; The truth that says you are a child of God and everything pales in comparison.Highly highly recommend this book."
"What can I say about a battery for my Canon S95? It fits, it holds a charge, it works. The S95 uses lots of power, so I ordered an extra so that I'd have a backup. Sometimes I forget to charge the battery in the camera and then I really need it."
"Pros:No input lag (Had input lag on the Elgato when used with a Asus monitor)Small and PortableRan the coolest between the Elgato and HDPVR2Roxio's device is supported by multiple programs.Roxio has a built in LIVE stream program which lets you stream directly to Twitch.tv (Hauppauge and Elgato will soon follow)High bitrate while recordingAmazing Price. I purchased it for $98 and I have seen people get it for less.Worked flawlessly out of the box. No need to download codecs..etcCons:Too light, Feels cheap. (The Elgato and HDPVR2 feels better)Does not include any HDMI/Component cables. At $150 retail I would expect it to.The Design. I think the USB should have been in the middle so it doesn't interfere with the output or inputs.Neither the Roxio, Elgato, or the Hauppauge HDPVR2 would display the image as crisp/sharp if I was to bypass the products.HDPVR1 still has better raw recordings than all the external capture cards I have tested so far. Elgato comes in close second with the Roxio and HDPVR2 following.Program randomly stops running after streaming for about 45mins. (This can be fixed in the future)Conclusion: At $100 you really are getting the most bang for your buck. I had a really good experience with the Roxio. I would recommend this product when it's on sale. At retail price I would be looking at Elgato's and/or Hauppauge's products to get the include cables at around the same price."
"Vest fit as expected, looked great! Went very well with jeans and white dress shirt. Can go as evening casual or dress."
"Its a very cute case but 3 of the diamonds are missing but it came faster than i think i really love this case for my phone i will be buying another one"
"They are cute and they fit me perfectly love it they are just like they are shown love them !!!!"
"I got the case and did everything the manual showed and the charger did not work. I did this for two days and it never charged my iPhone 4."
"Amazing pair of flats, definitely worth the money. A bit uncomfortable for the 1st two wears but after that it'll stretch out. Very versatile. Lots of compliment! Would recommended. LOVE DOLCE VITA!"
"I have had bark covers before but this one was crazy crazy dark for me I wasn't happy with it.."
"it came apart the 3rd time i used it.. :("
"Honestly I have been using the product for two weeks now and I have to say that I have hereditary dark eye circles but yet before I decide to write my review I look myself in the mirror with a bright light like a thousand times so I can give details of my improvement. Well first of all I use the product in all my face and neck, my face appearance looks more bright and my eyes look a little refresh that is why I didn't fill in all the stars bc I am still waiting on a more deep result on my eye area but honestly they look much better than when I wasn't using this product oh another thing I would like to add ladies if you have a minimal dark spot in your face this product helps!!!! Honestly I had dark spot on both side of my upper checks and I don't see it any longer so keep that in mind I guess since is a natural product it works great on skin. Ideally like my queen bee and when it finish I would buy another also ladies when applying this product on your face don't forget the sun screen is very essential :-)"
"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my parents.  They loved the color; it goes perfect with the color of their bedroom and they especially loved the thread count."
"The picture of this product is wrong or the seller just made a mistake. I got the Beatles Abbey Road cover shirt, not this Sgt. Pepper one. It's nice but not what was ordered. And it does fit too small compared to most smalls i've ordered before."
"This shirt is better than what i'd hope for! Beautiful colors, great fit! Just perfect buy! I very much recommend it!"
"For an excited 2 year old who can't sleep a few weeks before Christmas, I let him open one of his presents early, namely the Cars 2 Lightening McQueen Light, and he LOVES it.  He loves anything Lightening McQueen and gets so excited about the pop up light.He's still holding on to it and will probably fall asleep with it.The toy is as much fun as any toy car for a boy who loves to play with cars, and of his favourite movie character AND a light, it's the trifecta of a great Christmas present and I was thrilled to find it.I gave the car 3 stars for educational but only since I couldn't decide how to rate it, it's fun watching him push the button to get the light and voice sounds and it's about as educational as any toy car can be for a two year old.The toy looks fairly durable, but as with all 2 year olds I'm sure there's a way, for the price though it was worth it watching the present being torn open and it'll last a long while after that.Fast delivery courtesy of the perks of Amazon Prime.  Over all, we're all thrilled with the excitement it's brought as an early Christmas gift."
"Not only does this tank not work as promised, it is also too small. Any fish living in it won't grow any more than an inch or live past 6 months due to the size of the &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34;. Instead of this, go get a REAL fish tank. Most fish need 5-10 gallon tanks, and they aren't that expensive either. Depending on the type of fish, they need a heater, a air stone, and a filter. With all of these, the fish will most likely will live at least 5 years."
"It is a great game I love it the best game ever it is nice you should get this game"
"Bought these for some of my shop equipment. Work great!! A great value as compared to $5.00 each  when bought locally"
"Great product. it allows me to  put a battery tender charger on my deep cycle battery in my trailer without having to run an extention cord through the doorway. Keeps my battery fully charged all the time. Fast shipping"
"! was able to replace the batteries in quite a few pieces of equipment without braking the bank. Great value at a great price"
"Very great value. Saved a bundle mover the retail store prices. Was able to get my equipment working again at a great price"
"I got the tape buy the scheduled time. Put it in my player, and it worked great. Cured  the problem I was having with a dirty tape head. Great company to deal with . I give them an  AAAAAAAA_+++++++++++."
"I bought this for my niece for her second birthday and she loves it. It has all the things a little girl would need to carry a purse like her mom."
"I really like this cardigan and the fact that it is long works out great. I am 5'7 and like shirts to be a bit longer. I have worn it several times and am pleased."
"These fit good and are great for running. The colors are brighter then the pic. I use these for running outdoors."
"I gave it a five star because it was a snap to use.It fit and worked like charm in an X-box 360."
"When I tell you...these pants are the best I have ever had..love the fit and very comfortable. .deserve 10 stars!!!!!"
"Very good taste, very good item and very good price. I love it very much and will buy it again."
"Very good item and very good price. My wife and I love it very much and will buy it again."
"Microsoft Software.Thanks for your quick service in getting it to me, since I use Word and Excel all the time."
"They are great, I don't have to iron them. Also, they are very cool (temperature cool) for a synthetic material."
"Gave it to my Dad for his birthday.  He used it right away which is good, because he keeps his money, license and credit cards together with a worn out rubber band."
"My grandson loves both Mega Bloks and Hot Wheels, what a great combination. They really hold up to the abuse that a six year old can dish out."
"I loved it! It helped me understand the scene better! If you loved Divergent, I'd definitely recommend that you read this book! It's very short, so it doesn't take long :)"
"THE GUM WAS HORRIBLE TASTING...OLD AND HARD...THE WORST EVER I JUST THREW IT IN THE CORNER  ANYBODY WANT ITIT WAS NOT REAL BAZOOKA"
"I've never written a review before but I had to for this book because it was literally so horrible. I had seen some quotes from it that seemed so beautiful that I just had to read it -- and there were some great quotes, but they were obscured by the rest of this monstrosity of horrible-ness. The characters are extremely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. Sutter is this raging alcoholic who doesn't feel anything as much as he says he does. I feel like his motto of embracing the now is a total sham, because although he says to live in the moment ten million times, he's just going through the actions. Getting drunk and going to parties and talking to attractive women...this doesn't mean you are always living spectacularly. Not if it means shoving your actual feelings into a deep dark hole and not caring about anyone who loves you. Then there's Aimee, who I feel has so much potential but instead is a character who Sutter simply uses and corrupts. Sutter keeps saying he wants to show Aimee she can be her own person and that she doesn't have to be trodden on by her family, but then Sutter goes ahead and stomps all over her. I didn't like the writing style of Tharp much either. It never quite flowed well for me."
"I was looking for a sturdy bag to carry my ostomy supplies without being too large or bulky...this fit exactly what I needed. The large inner pocket fits all of my medical essentials, and the exterior pockets fit my keys, phone, flashlight, and multi tool. As a concealed carrier, the rear pocket fits my S&amp;W perfectly, and I even have a pocket to fit a couple of extra clips...Great Bag"
"Change of Address was a great book! Rick did an awesome job at developing the characters through vivid description without using too much as filler. Overall the book moved pretty fast. It had a few different side plots to where something was always happening or being uncovered. Can't wait to read the others!"
"Cute top, I know it's easy to mix and match but I wish they sold bottoms that matched as well."
"The concept is cool and the distance on the remote is pretty good. It's not very loud, but the vibration is also kind of weak. Not a horrible toy, but definitely not worth the price."
"This is a must have for people starting off with the Gelish.  Great value compared to what you pay for them separately."
"I thought the color was pretty. A very bright neon pink. However, I do not feel this brand is equally comparable to Gelish brand polish. This seemed to peel off very easily, which is a problem I never really have with Gelish."
"I am a new truck driver, I have my very 1st run an ill b gone for 6 weeks so I thought abt buying my husband this hat as a ill miss u gift an something he could use during his truck traning  So I did, I bought it an had a note put on it so he would know I bought this for him. I held my breath an waited for a phn call from him abt the package. The delievery date came up an still No call abt the package  I checked the tracking number an it said delievered. But it was to the WRONG address. So now I have no gift for my husband an I jus lost the money I paid for this hat. Its not retrieveable an now I'm miles away from home very upset I buy a lot off of amazon its my go 2 site over all I'm sure it was nice hat."
"I actually bought two from this company.  They arrived on time and was packaged nicely. They fit our Verizon Samsung tab 2 7.0 perfectly.  The picture does no justice.  The feel of the inside is soft an i like how the inside has a velcro  snap to make sure the tablets are in place, they dont just slide in. It has a magnetic like thing that helps keep the flap closed for when your not using it. I dont know how durable they are but for this price i couldn't pass it up."
"I bought this case because i liked the fact that it was a dual protector and stylish.  It arrived on time and was packaged well. I ordered a few things from this company and all i kept waiting for was my phone case (bc i was excited) . I have the Verizon LG G2 and this case was very easy to put on, its not to bulky. This is a big phone to begin with and i was worried the rubber piece would be to big with my phone in it for the hard case to snap on, but it all fit perfect, i am very satisfied with this company and all my products i purchase from them. I recommend purchasing from them."
"This cleaver is great. It has heft and cuts through meat and bone very easily. I would recommend this product."
"It is a good prequel and stays true to the original. The product arrived very quickly, greatly impressed with the fulfillment of the order."
"I really liked this case. It looked just like it did in the picture, BUT some of the stones did fall off."
"Being a full time college student and having 2 part time jobs, it is very difficult to stay focused and alert. I have been lacking in the sleep department and have been relying on coffee and energy enhancers. I normally hate relying on anything other than all natural things to give me the energy that i need. So i was super surprised when i found out that this was all natural. Not only have this given me extra energy that i've never had before, but this supplement has made me more alert, more focused and my memory is better than it has been in months. i will never spend another dime on coffee or energy drinks. SO glad i found this holy grail."
"i really love this cookbook. It was very helpful for me. It not only taught me how to make many yummy snacks, it also taught  me how to do the paleo diet the right way. I also loved how easy this was. I have a really busy hectic life, so i loved how fast these recipes were. It didn't take anytime at all to make these snacks. It also has great kid snacks, that my younger cousins loved. i'll defiantly be looking out for more cookbooks from them."
"I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE.  ITS A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS STORY.  I AM GLAD THAT I PURCHASED IT.  I WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN."
"I gave it to a co-worker who teaches sixth-graders for a Christmas gift.  She loves it, not only for how pretty it is, but also for the message it carries to remind her how to encourage her students to achieve their best every time she wears it.  It seems well made, and is a very attractive piece of jewelry.  I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"I love this product.  A friend recommended it and promised I would see a difference in my nails after one month.  Boy! Was she ever right.  It did not let me down.  I followed the directions from Nail Tek, and it did make my nails much stronger.  I noticed a difference in my right hand in about two weeks and after a month both hands look great.  Everyone wants to know what I have done to get them so long and strong.  I tell them, &amp;#34;Nail Tek.&amp;#34;  It has been 2 months now and I have yet to break a nail.  Thanks Nail Tek and thanks to my friend."
"My son loves this ball.. only one with one like it on his team.. it's a very unusual soccer ball.."
"This story was definitely different from what I have been reading. Not at all predictable. I've been looking for a different kind of ending and I found it."
"I thought this one was going to be just a flat documentary book, but after I started the first few chapters, I just kept going and going. The paragraphs are flowing attractively, and the more I read, the more I found the interesting knowledges and ideas within. This is a great true story, and also inspirational one I happened to stumble upon. There are not much sports writings that left me feeling good, energized, intrigued, and eager to try the techniques myself. This one does. I felt grateful and happy for McDougall to be willing to share this good writing."
"this is one of the best brushes that I have this is a must get brush so get yours because I got mines."
"This is the BEST product I have ever purchased.The potty training process can be such a nightmare but I committed to stop using diapers at night and my daughter was dry after only 2 nights using the Conni pad.I'm absolutely delighted. Every mom with a toddler who needs night time training should get one. I imagine they would be perfect for bedwetters also. It is very absorbent yet feels dry."
"I got the lite version and it keeps saying this one cant be installed. Love the game though. Any suggestions?"
"Just  LOVE  it !!!!"
"I bought this when my son was just over a year, after having youtube on repeat forever on Gigglebellies! He loves it and can't get enough. Excellent for kids, colorful, educational and musical!"
"Toby's song is right on track, in fact the Father gave Jesus words of life to speak.  Those words were eternal life, and the moment they were believed the person passed from death into life and would never perish.  John 3:16"
"While I like all little feat music.... everyone has their favorites. My perfect is to mix the new with the old , throw in some great live cuts. How much better do get?"
"Love this product.  Help with circulation.  Supports the nervous system.  Great in water or tea.  Helps your skin.  I put it on a cotton ball and smell it helps with the mind.  You can buy a aromatherapy diffuser from Amazon place it on the pad and plug in."
"black label, fast shipping very amazing condition, aside from a little water damage to the cover art at the upper left edge nothing noticeable though."
"Love the series, always have. Great to finally have it on DVD. Had to buff a nasty scratch out of the first disk of season one that was causing problems playing the last episode on the disk, but aside from that, all good."
"Don't you just love a novel that hooks you from the very beginning and will not let you go until the last page? And when the story is over, you pick up another book and it is equally as engrossing. There are lots of books like that. But every now and again something else happens. A different kind of book winds up in your hands. You come across one of those rare creations that will completely turn you inside out and tie your heart in a double knot. And when you've finished reading it, it takes a while for you to recover before starting another book. I finished Televenge a few days ago and I can tell you this--I am still recovering. Pam has the ability to string words together that pierces every emotion in the reader. I found myself laughing over the down home southern humor. I found myself heartbroken and shedding tears by the buckets. I found myself afraid of turning the page, not knowing what was on the other side. But turning the page anyway because I couldn't stop reading. I found myself forgetting to breathe. Pam hits the bull's eye with her blunt truths that she brings to the page. The story takes you beyond normal. Beyond intriguing. Beyond stunning. Televenge is one of those rare creations that I live for."
"I love my bag It is exactly what I was looking for! It is big enough to fit everything I need and more!"

SO THE CAPACITY OF THE BATTERY RECEIVED WAS ALMOST HALF OF THE ONE PURCHASED ACCORDING TO THE ADVERTISED PRODUCT. NEVERTHELESS, I ENDED VERY SATISFIED FOR THE MERCHANT IMMEDIATE AND POSITIVE RESPONSE TO MY CLAIM. I WISH TO IMCREASE MY EVALUATION TO THREE STARS NOT TO THE ITEM BUT TO THE MERCHANT IN RECOGNITION TO HIS GOOD ATTITUDE."

"I'm pretty sure what Devicewear was trying to do with this case was give an iPad user all the protection and functions as they could while giving them a case that didnt make it heavier or bulkier. The case is great. I have had it for a while now and it works great. Its very well built not alot of signs of wearing. I love it"
"Its a good product but mine was imported broken.the wood was broken before imported,I belief it was broken because I didnt see any broken piece inside the package and it was well protected,meaning they knew it before sending it to me.Secondly I didnt like the colour its a little dull.Delivery was fast and on time ."

"This toy was the least favorite of the toys that my child received for Christmas. In theory this is a great idea, but in reality they are kind of limiting. If you like blocks like we do, then it is a fun &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; to have in your block collection. But if your funds are limited, just get a really good block set with lots of blocks. Your kids will then have no limits. Or try Keva planks.....those are way cool!"

"I got this exact case for $20 and my friend got the orange one just like it, within less than a week the camo print on the back was already worn off. I'm guessing its because of how its printed on the case, and it doesn't help that I'm a teenager. I believe that the case is and ""felt"" cheap. I feel like it was a waste of my money and should've spent it on a different case."
"I love this case, I find it very durable! Easy to put together, and hard to take a part, which I find good if you have little ones around your device."
"We received this item today, we liked the look of the case and fit the phone really good, would have gave it 5 stars if the belt clip had been in our package. The belt clip was one o the reason we ordered it"

"The trigear output was less than 220 v. So  I can't use it for my so I put it  aside."
"Its an amazing helmet. Fits perfect to scale. only bad thing was the chin. its there to stop a lot of air from coming in but also prevents you from opening your mouth. I think it could've been more comfortable as well as flexible or adjustable. Another bad thing is the color. it gets dirty so fast. the finger prints are very noticeable and so are any little scratches. aside from those two bad things the helmet itself is amazing. fits perfect, looks great, feels great, the internal sunglasses are a big bonus, and the mechanisms on the helmet are cool. Great Helmet for that price!! Will def. buy another if I need too."
"This is a well structured book with a clear, scientific thesis to its credit.  The rationale is well built up  and leaves one with the sense that  this is a manageable  process , maybe repetitive  in parts but  not a strain to read and think about.  Unlike many such books  it leaves a thoughtful residue which affects  what one buys  and what one eats.  That is a very good outcome.I could recommend it to friends and those concerned to manage their overall health issues, not just the question of losing weight.It must be a good read as I have returned to read it again several times."
"This book is full of facts about the history we have never been told about before of all the once diverse ancient Christianities which were banned and suppressed, only to be rediscovered in the 20th century. This has caused many, including myself, to question &amp;#34;Christianity&amp;#34; as it is being taught and preached to us today.....and surely anyone else who reads this book!!!!"

"The concept of the cutting chain with a rope pull on either side is a very good idea, but it is difficult to postition the cutting edge of the chain to the branch to be cut. In addition, the clamps holding the rope to the cutting chain let loose during operation. After replacing the clamps the unit worked better."
"i have to confess this was the first book to whet forever my craving for darkness. it seems so light and brainy after years; but then i can go back and read again and again, now it only takes an hour or two, and each read it pulls me back into that original mood like giant vultures' wings slowly flapping over me. heathcliff is of course the most truthful embodiment of a woman's fantasy. emily dug far down, long before evolution was the buzz word, when all we knew was that adam and eve fell, and emily knew the coldness of life's force. my professors, one of these i'm thinking of male, the other female, dismissed my theory as misreading of a revolutionily defiant woman. how can they be so far from their own guts? the worse was the male professor, a diehard wimp-roaster who was jealous of heathcliff's hardness and fevered coldness. even my deep love kate bush missed the mood with her whininess of ""heathcliff it's me Cathy i'm coming home now""--so much sentimentality! emily goes further into any heart of darkness that light and cheery old joseph ever could dare. even though this masterpiece has seemed airier and brighter now i've dipped further, in other works, it is so strong it can still trick me back into its spell."
"now here is some terrific horror all right, this one is done by my master king, its already a classic only twenty five years since it came out, i don't even know where to begin praising it so ill just praise it. you see with the right horror like this you have to have a ground of not-horror, you cant have the whole world just horrible like some sneaky writers do because then you don't have any place to feel whats horrifying and whats not. thats what my professor calls the stability factor. you see, if everythings horrifying then nothing is, it just feels all yucky.this ones a good example of how horrors the new great genre like plays were in shakespeares time, back when they wanted poetic words so the bard had to make all his words that way. now kings like my master king don't have to be all showoff that way because they get to you through the real stuff, his talking straight in language you know since you were in the playground, the point is in the eerie world they make. the words arent there to show off what a great word maker he is and get in the way of the story but to open you right into what youre looking at, the characters and all the tension that develops. that's right, the words are like clear windows. now thats literature, thats what peoplell be reading in five centuries, if theyll even talk of hamlet anymore.i wont give away the story anymore than this, ill just say the scariest thing is when you realize these things get into peoples blood through using computers you start to think uh-oh what if this computer im using lets some creatures in through the screen. talking about computer bugs and bots and viruses. but ill just say go get it and flip right through hundred of pages of gripping gripping scared out of your britches but you always come back to where you are in the end and everything is all right."
"I usually wear and 8/8.5 I ordered the 8.5 and they fit great, albeit snug. Very happy with these shoes!"
"First time buying this.  Not really thrilled with it.  I feel I could have gotten the same results with my usual foundation."
"The dress color came in darker than the image showed.  I was expecting a pale pink, more of a blush color, but it is more of a light tan color.  The length is too long for me, I'm 5' 2' with a little heal,  so I will have to take it to get hemmed.  Over all it is still a nice dress and I am going to keep it."
"Fell in love with the royal blue dress but the top is cut very low. There were no Crystal-like beads anywhere on the dress that i received.  I was actually looking forward to a little beading, but it is still nice without it.Be careful of the neckline, if you are anything more than an A cup.  The &amp;#34;Girls&amp;#34;  will be quite exposed.  I am a C cup, so I took the dress to a dress maker to see if she could add about 2&amp;#34; to the top for more coverage."
"Got the shawl to use with a sleeveless evening gown for a wedding.  This will do nicely.  The chiffon material is nice, has a little weight to it...that's a good thing.  The hems are finished nicely; no lose threads.  Just needs a little steam to take the packaging crease out and I'll be ready to go."
"Rich and creamy.  It lathers up nicely and has a beautiful sent.  Skin feels moisturized and soft all day. Will be purchasing more of this product."

"It's okay for a starter kit.  I it has just enough stuff to start with.  We need just a little more thread."

"I love this show and bow u can watch it were ever I go is even better I love amazon"
"I like the game even though it is not my favorite game in the whole wide world but thank you for making the game"
"It has one flaw though, it needs a door.  Also, not a complaint, but, if you do get one, take into account how tall your dog is standing on her or his back legs and allow for that."
"This toy is almost as good as the puppy kong! It keeps her occupied when the kong toy isn't being used (have to switch out toys sometimes so they don't get bored!) and is also helping with her teething."
"I would rate it higher, but the wheel for it is made of plastic.  Won't last long at all if you have a dog with any kind of strength.  They get going on the trolley and that thing will break when it hits the end if they have anything besides a fast walk going on or if they pull really hard.  I had to go to the hardware store and buy a metal one."
"OK, yes, I was looking for a sci-fi book and ran across this one. Not my usual genre, but it looked good, so I am please to say that I am not a fool and actually bought a great book. Ha!"

"On top of the fact that all of the corners were mushed, on the back cover there's a huge gash in the bottom right corner. ugh, that's so dissapointing. I'm contemplating returning it for a new copy. But for now, the disks are fine and I guess it'll do."
"This newest album from Nancy is phenomenal! You can feel the power and the presence of God with each and Every song! BUY it!!! It's amazing!"

"This album was worth waiting for. I`m a big fan and one her song`s were played at my wedding in the church.She just gets better and better"

"I like this book because it makes me feel happy joy full and  sleepy  you should read it and love it have a great time reading if you don't like it please, please return it just read it.love Amia"
"This is another great shape from Cleo. I wear this, the Marcie, and the Lucy all in a 28G. It runs true to size and creates a really nice upfront and projected profile. I was tentative to try the Lily because it's based off the Meg, which is a notoriously difficult fit, but Cleo made great improvements to this style. I would be hesitant to recommend this to anyone who is very full on top or very full on bottom though. They may not be able to fill out the top or may experience cutting in along the top. It works well because I'm evenly shaped."
"I was very happy with these protein bars and they contain 30 g of high quality absorbable protein and have a hearty amount of calories to get your day started on the right foot and keep you satisfied longer than other bars that I have had. I am a very active athlete and these are perfect. The sweet potato/pumpkin combo has great taste. I will definitely be ordering again. They came earlier than expected!!  :)"
"These running shoes arrived earlier than expected and were ready to go! No break in period!! I have worn EVERY brand of running shoe and I am very impressed by the quality, comfort, support and feel of these runners. They are at the top of the list and my feet need specifics. They do not bother my achilles or my plantar faschiitis which I am both prone too and they also helped with my hip stability due to the smoothness of the stride of the shoe. I will be ordering another of the same next time the price is right as well!! :)"
"I reted this 5 stars because of the ease in installing. It certainly met my expectations. No cutting required. Finally a product that is easy to use."
"Unable to put down until finished!  Definitely 5 star!  Nothing like an emotional roller coaster ride!  Can not wait for next book!"
"I'm just used it first time,the motor out burning smell ! I think I won't use again!Waste my money!"

"It's cheap and not made well, it keeps coming off and I've already lost the back of one of them, they don't grip the phone very well but for $.01 and free shipping I'd buy it again and again and again and again~"
"I am so sad that this is over, but you can only cook meth and yell at Jesse for so long...what else do you want?"

"I have a terrible back acne problem for over 10 years, and have pretty much gave up on it because I'm tired of spending 100's even 1000's on stuff that doesn't work or works for only a limited time frame.Idk why i haven't tried this earlier but apparently it works for my back acne. I'm not trough my 5th lbs and 2nd bottle of vinegar, and i apply it almost every day before going to bed unless i'm too tired to go trough process.I mix 2 spoons of clay and add vinegar until i get a paste in a porcelain bowl (mixing it with fingers you are anyways going to apply it).I apply a layer on my back and even though i thought it's not working after two weeks my acne started to clear (i apply it to my face too just for the heck of it even though i have no face acne). After applying wait 20 min and then jump into shower. this part is messy but it's a shower. I applied it over 30 times and had no problems with the drain. don't try to rub it of just stand under a shower and it will come of in 2-5 minutes. i like to take long showers so after 10 more min there is almost no mud left in the shower. maybe people who force large amount of it had problems with drains but if you let water do the work i'm sure you'll be fine (don't forget that i cover my whole back and i'm 6 3' and 180 pounds)Anyways this works and i would recommend it to everyone that has a back acne problem, just be patient and results will come"
"Does not fit 2005 Audi S4 convertible as a break light. If you are looking for it Sylvania 7225 fits"

"It works perfectly as I was envisaging it when I originally had it newly installed by Home Depot years ago"
"I didn't get the part I ordered. I received a stock charging latch not Even close to the one pictured or described."
"Hard to tell the front from the back, very hard to serperate from edge. Would be nice not to have to cut lable out. Would not buy again."
"Very good, long cord, easy use, durable. Everything I expected and and more. I would buy it again if needed."
"Nice material and color. Stands up on its own. Perfect for watching videos. There's a hole in the back for the camera."
"I love this necklace becausr it's a simply cross that you can wear with anything ! I also keep getting good complements on it. But the only bad thing about this necklace is that it broke a week after I had start wearing it. I was just sitting there doing nothing and it just fell of my neck out of the blue. And the part that broke was the main peice you us to connect it. Now it is just harder to connect it in the back, but I deal with it because I love the cross."
"Bought this pair of shoes from Academy. Used them for work because my other shoes kept giving me cramps in my feet. I used them for almost a year and the concrete surface I wear them on has worn them down and needed a new pair. I have had no problem with these shoes. They have been wonderful to wear. I couldn't find them in a local store so I went online. I was very happy to order another pair. I don't usually like paying a lot of money on shoes but these shoes are worth it. The only shoes I wear for work now."
"This headset was incredible in every way compared to the headsets of my past! I was only sorely disappointed when after only having them for a little less than a year, the plastic holding the ears to the headpiece snapped. Clearly these weren't made for big heads. :("
"Not quite as dark of a red as is shown in this picture. The steering wheel cover would not fit over my steering wheel despite being advertised as &amp;#34;meant for a PT Cruiser&amp;#34;. The set itself was EXTREMELY difficult to assemble and honestly if I could, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. Just like in the image though, the floor mats are a completely different shade of red and make me wonder why they didn't just pair this set with black. All in all- it was ok for the price, but I would advise against purchasing this set."
"Okay, so there are some issues with this one. The main one being the size. You will have to be careful of what size milk steamer container you purchase- the big ones will NOT fit in this little guy. BUT I just put mine up on a pedastool (lucking coffee maker- LOL) and it works very well. I use shot glasses when making my espresso and it works perfectly. It does not have an automatic shut-off, so you will have to keep an eye on your espresso and make sure it isn't geting too watery.I LOVE mine!!! I have had it for over a year and a half and have NEVER had an issue with it. Easy to clean, easy to use and GREAT results! If you have never had an espresso machine before (this is my first) this is a GREAT place to start! Cheap- compared to most other machines, works AWESOME and makes super yummy espresso drinks!Thank you!"
"I LOVE this! It is in our entry way and it is LOVELY!!! The size is very impressive and the finish is beautiful!!!! The light it puts off is very nice- plenty of light without being blinding at all. I love how it can be traditional or contempory!!! VERY good deal and I highly recommend this one!!! Thank you!"
"I order these on the large size and I'm glad I did, as they fit perfectly as they are. So if I would have gotten my &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; size it would most likely be snug. They are lovely though and more of a skin-tone color than an off-white I was expecting. Very comfortable but I have to be careful what I wear them with, because as I said, it looks like I'm not wearing leggings at all. Super fast shipping and good packaging! Thank you!"
"Speechless...fabulous....addictive...must read more :) I cannot wait to read the second book.  I am dying to see what happens between them"
"I purchased the light grey hobo/handbag, however, it is not near the color I expected. More bronzie, however with that said, I do love the size and convience of it as I am trying to get away from such a large handbag, but yet one that will hold what I carry and this bag does just that, I will keep it and enjoy it, besides the color is growing on me even though it's not grey. tac"

"Love this case.  Very durable.  I have dropped my phone several times with this case on it.  Hasn't cracked or broken yet:)"
"I have a pair of bike shorts that are too snug around the thigh even though they are a Lg,( I am a  size 14) I ordered these in a large because of the reviews stating they were generous and they fit just great!  I wear them under my regular yoga capries or shorts and I love the flexibility of using clothing I am comfortable in.  The padding works for my 10 mi or less trips, don't know if there is enough for the longer rides yet."
"I loved this book. It kept my interest and had me wanting more. Can't wait to start the second book."
"For 4$ how could you beat this! Lovely shape and nice snug fitting. You can go for a cute lolita look with these or just a casual outfit. Highly recommend these!"

"OUR CHURCH Was studying this book so I bought it. The book is not adiet plan but a life plan."
"This was a birthday gift for my son.  He said it did not have a memory card in the camera.  Perhaps this was my error in not realizing this when I ordered the camera since  I have purchased other cameras and the card was included.  Otherwise this was a good choice for him.  Thank you.  Linda Lucas"
"I used it to hold my dry-erase markers on the glass wall next to my desk, however, it does hold up on cube-walls too! Awesome desk organizer tool :)"
"this shoes is very comfortable and very usable ~~very ooood~~~!!i bought 3 sandals.i like it very much."
"I am a big fan of Steven King. Read almost all of his books. I read the shining and saw the movie.I enjoyed the book. I realize now that when Mr. King was younger he suffered from alcoholism, and this addiction gave him the ability to write some seriously out there novels. He is sober now, and so is the craziness.The book gave closure to Danny Torrence, but alcoholism and it's negative affects was part of the theme. The book was not as out there because the craziness of alcoholism is now in check.I wish Mr. King continued sobriety, and thank him for the numerous books I devoured through the years. I am sure it was not easy....,"
"So comfortable.I want to buy at least two more before they stop making them.No need to break them in."
"I LOVE IT SO MUCH! It makes my phone look a million times better! I definatly recommend this product! It let's me slide my phone out and in and when i dropped my phone by accident, none of the rhinestones came off and my phone had no damage to it! THANKS!"

"was very realistic for the halloween costume i used it for. its durable and is fully metal. i would just recommend getting the silver one cause the gold wears off after awhile."
"This is a beautiful case that lives up to its description. It arrived on time and undamaged. The only thing I would caution future customers about is its finish. It's color is listed as &amp;#34;gold,&amp;#34; so there's no misleading advertising, but it is REALLY gold and very shiny. It's a beautiful case though and reminds me of a pocketbook for an evening gown...not a bad idea actually."
"I originally purchased my first keurig in 2010. It worked for about a year, then started pouring water out the back. I exhchanged it for a new one (LOVE Bath &amp; Body Work's return policy!), but that one began doing the same thing maybe 4 months later. I returned it and went back to a regular coffee maker for a while. I found a Keurig on sale at Lowe's for $65, so gave it another shot only to have it get ruined by my dad's pet cockatoo (he has an obsession with electric cords and chew that out and somehow broke the top). Anyway, I was about ready to give up altogether on coffee when I saw the reviews on this! It makes a super quick cup o coffee without any risk of breaking! Seriously, this is the best purchase I've made in a long time! Well worth it!!"
"Because this vitamin gives me energy n helps me feel good. ! If I run out I feel difference n especially after five days so I try n order as soon as low abt three pills but u all get me order n short time. Thank I."
"I've been looking for a good military-style peacoat for years, ladies. Years. This coat fits great, but is very snug in the chest. If you have big boobs, go a size up. The shoulders fit perfectly, which is a difficult thing to find, more than one might think. It's the best. The color is the best. Sleeve length is just right.. It nips in juuust enough at the waist. My favorite is the collar's details. The navy on the reverse, the standup-ishness....swoon.Hyperbolically,Juliet"
"They didn't exactly fit as a 'legging', like I was hoping. They are larger in the butt and ankle area than I would have liked, but I still wear them weekly!"
"Easy to use a mobile. If you're taller than 4ft, be ready to tuck your legs behind you as you hang and pull."
"I bought this pepper because I wanted a lot of cayenne powder I mean a lot. I drink shots of this powder daily and I do like it but I'm not sure if it's just me but it does not seem to strong I sweat for a minute but I feel like it could be stronger I even touched my eyes to see if it would hurt still not feeling much pain. Im one in 7 billion so do forget my review since I'm more hardcore."
"My idea of Colorado is &amp;#34;Mountains&amp;#34;.  Colorado Landscapes seemed to focus on the flatlands and foothills.  It gave you no idea where you were  - it could have used a narrator or notes on-screen."
"This book is really great for those that have an artistic soul and looking for better life or business. I highly recommend it."
"The condition of the book was exactly as described. There were minimal if any damages, and certainly nothing that would hinder the use of the book."
"Only negative. Thing I can say is when my fish swim near the sides of the tank at the top they aren't illuminated by the light from the center. The blue night light is beautiful. The led light gives a healthy glow during the day, and overall the Hood looks and works great"
"most boys would eat this up. it has all the requisite characteristics of a movie for young boys. it was funny, it had some good fights, some out-smarting some bad guys, and explosions to boot. I didn't watch the whole thing with him, but picked up on some good lessons about being yourself and being true to friends. not a morality lesson, but hey--better than lots of garbage out there. he really enjoyed it and went back to see some parts again/show me. he would have watched it again immediately if I hadn't kiboshed the idea...-mom"
"Love it"
"Love it love it &amp;#9829;&amp;#9829;&amp;#9829;"
"Exactly as advertised, good quality, fast delivery. It looks so cute on my great grandson. His family was so proud to have everyone sporting the Cowboys outer ware."
"Love this grill and the fact that the plates are removable to put in the dishwasher.  Bun warmer doesn't grill the buns but just warms them up but I didn't buy the unit for that anyways.  It's also twice as big as my last George Foreman grill so I am a happy grilled!!!"
"I wanted a razor and brush stand that would give off the classy 1920s/30s vibe that seemed to match with using a safety razor. This stand does the job. It fits my razor and brush perfectly, and looks damn good while it does it."
"It is very good. The book looks very new and some of key point were highlighted. It is very useful for me to preview and review. Thank you very much."
"This is a gift for my friend! Her skin is very dry, so I think this is the best for her. I think she will be happy."
"I have purchased this product several times and have gotten the same poor results, the adhesive sucks.  I have used it to hang many small objects, such as a tv remote, a small alarm clock or even to hide wires unde a cabinet.  The adhesive just does not stick well to anything, except itself.  I have no complaints about the hook and loop side, but it is certainly not anything that should be called &amp;#34; industrial strength&amp;#34; if the adhesive cant even hold up a tv remote,  3M please fix this problem, I know you have better permanent adhesive that can withstand a warm surface, but this product adhesive is a big FAIL!"
"It was a gift for my son but he told me he liked it very much and use it for the whole body.  That is all I know, sorry!"
"Because I have not gotten the book yet, I may change my mind when I get it. I will let you know."
"It was just what I needed, I had lost mine at work, I was use to using it, it was verry handy and I was happy to replace it."
"A great little bit. I was having trouble finding a bit in this size and was glad to have found it. Not disappointed in the performance. Holds up well to heven harder woods."
"I'm sorry but this movie was horrible. i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing. The acting was bad, the plot sucked, and nobody actually knew how to play the guitar. I'll give it this, some of the humor was good, but that was the only good point. The music may be considered good by some but to me the songs grated on my nerves and all the background music was cheap and overused. This might be acceptable for kids, but it certainly is not for me. Oh, and cinderella is saddened by this lack of respect to her name."
"This book is life changing! Jesus really is real and He really does love us. And He is the same yesterday, today, and forever! He is still doing miracles and amazing things and He has called us to do even greater!"
"Bought this for my 21"" asp to give it some length and make it easier to grab which makes it easier to get out of the scabbard. It looks great and even after several months of use there are only a couple marks from dropping it. I am only a security guard but I will be using this product on my asp once I become a Police Officer."
"I love it! But there's some flaws like nothing really! Its so fun now i can reach my friends over summer! How cool! You should definitely download this app! Enjoy:)"

"Just ok!"
"The Foscam FI8919W is a great camera. I am a dealer for Foscam and I sell a lot of the FI9810W. Fantastic camera for the money. I thought I would try this camera and bought 3 for my company to test. So great... We hooked it up in 5 minutes, setup is like any other Foscam Camera, the IR works great, not sure why people are putting this camera down... We have been ""working"" one of the cameras all the time to try to make it fail and it still works great. Im buying more and going to promote it more as well."
"Not stable. Had to return."

"We ordered this Ted doll for our son that is in college. It was the Christmas hit in our household. After much research trying to make sure we ordered the right doll, we certainly received the correct one. This doll is the &amp;#34;EXPLICIT&amp;#34; version. We learned we needed to order the one with the &amp;#34;RED Letter R&amp;#34; tag to get what we wanted (which we did)! He also sings the &amp;#34;Thunder Song&amp;#34;! To our surprise, he is huge...a true 24&amp;#34;!! He also looked identical to the movie bear! We received this bear within 3 days, which was through our Amazon Prime account. I would highly recommend this one to anyone looking for these options. Will not be disappointed!"

"Hi Everyone,Well, I ordered this for my bible study group. There are quite a few bible study groups I will be visiting week after week and we need something to hold the bible as we teach but practical without the bulk. Can't wait to see what this one really looks like and works.I like it cause it will go with me where ever I go! Stay tuned...So I recieved this lectern and I was very pleased with the quality and how easy it is to set up. What made me so much more glad is that it can have a display banner attach to it and that thrilled me. I recommend this to any body who need a compact place to set their papers for a bible study or presentation."
"I bought this to fan myself in church and I was highly surprised to see how intriquet it was and how beautiful it looks when flashed. I would recommend it."

"The story should have continued into another book to see how things developed an how forest handled her new position. Would have loved to see the development between her an her father."
"I know they're cheap, but don't let amazon get away with false advertising. Compare the ones you receive with the set in the picture. NOT THE SAME. I don't know who could possibly give these false advertised chisels a good review. Anyone who knows anything about woodworking would know that these are Chinese garbage not worthy of a doorstop. Granted these are not premium chisels, but the ones pictured are good mid-level chisels. I don't know if anyone else is, but I am SO SICK of the false advertising on this website. The chisels shown in the picture are the Irwins that were still made in Sheffield England (originally Marples which was great quality), it even says it on the chisel in the picture. Irwin has outsourced their work to China unfortunately, but somehow Amazon is still allowed to show a picture of quality English made chisels and then send you the garbage made in China that have different handles, blade metal, and overall quality. THIS IS INSANE. Needless to say I sent the chisels back for a refund. Amazon gets an F for its report card today."
"this glue bonds a bit faster than the ones I'm used to, but that may just be getting more experienced in using it.However, it gets VERY hot for a few second when it dries, like a burning feel hot! If you have sensitive nails, get glue then dries cooler!"
"Perfect fit, charged well, worked first time, every time, sorry I waited so long to buy one. Very affordable, very happy."
"I had ordered a set of 11 books for a Sunday School Class. It seems to be a good book, but when I received the order, the pages and chapters on most of the books were all mixed up. I returned the books and asked for replacement books, but the replacements had exactly the same problem. I was then told that I would receive a refund and that I needed to find another supplier. The quality control was terrible, and it was even worse to find that the same problem existed on the second book after I had told Amazon exactly what was wrong with the first set. I have received a refund, but that is small consolation."

"I discovered the first book as a recommendation from amazon list..tried the sample and I've devoured them all in 3 days!! I can not wait for the next one! I'm a huge Ilona Andrews, nalini Singh, Patricia Briggs fan and I actually put on hold my new nalini for your stories I was fascinated by the world u created and the character depth and detail is wonderful. Even secondary characters have great back stories and I hope to learn more about them all. Excellent writing and transitioning a few editing mistakes thru out the books but u hooked me into the story so deep I didn't care and believe me when I say I almost NEVER get over those things... I don't want to be bogged down by my own version of auto correct in my mind thru the stories to miss the fun of reading one so thank you for being as diligent as u were and I'll be back in sept for the new one!!"
"This is a dumb app. all it is is a list of movies they think are a must have/see. Not the actual ability to watch the movie. Waste of money."

"Lampos deals with very difficult teaching situations in a very practical manner. Using true-life stories from her own experience, she weaves easily applicable educational principles throughout the book --- and she does it painlessly. ""Teaching Diamonds in the Tough"" is devotional in format, but don't let the casual structure fool you. This book has very powerful, sometimes heart-wrenching, stories of troubled children, their struggles and successes. And it presents some of the most workable ideas for teaching students like this that I have ever seen. Our culture is moving so fast in this direction that we are in danger of losing an entire generation if we don't learn how to teach, guide and mentor troubled students with love and acceptance. This book is a great tool for the job.David E. FessendenAuthor ofTeaching with All Your Heart: Bringing Curriculum &amp; Class to Life"

"I really loved this short story about what Devereux did the night before he met Kismet. Just as the author suggests, you really should read ""The Vampire Shrienk"" before you read this one, even though this was set in time before he met her. It was such a joy to read and I really like that it is a short story. It gives you a little more knowledge of what Devereux was like before he met Kismet and what he was dealing with. I would definatley recommend it to anyone!! If you like ""The Vampire Shrienk"" you will absolutely love this one!"
"Great insight into the making of this album - great stuff from the band"
"Great band, great concert - different lineup than the Falling Inbetween disc from a couple of years ago.  Set list is very cool - some great oldies from Hydra are included.  Nathan East rocks the low end on bass this concert - a great addition to the band."

"Fantastic book. All of Greenfields books are educational and motivational.  I would recommend to a friend as well as following up with podcasts."
"I just finished Sweet Thing and have the biggest smile on my face:) *points finger... Renee Carlino is amazing! She had me with the prologue, I thought "" wow, this is different"" after you read so many books they sort of start to become obvious and there are so many with the same story line. I loved will, he was a breath of fresh air. My husband walked in on me reading and laughed and said "" a good one, huh?""  If you haven't read this, you really should."

"It is a good game but unless you buy it, you don't get to play much of it. Would have liked to see more before planning on buying."
"its ok I mean it has more than 20 settings. but the vibration is weak. Its more to get you aroused than to get you off. If someone where sensitive then yeah this would probably work for them. this is for four play"

"Its like a toothbrush attached to a motorcycle motor! Works great. I would buy this again next time well worth the money."
"The copy I purchased was used but in decent shape.  There are no highlights or underlines in the text.  The seller shipped the book immediately and I was pleasantly surprised to receive my book so quickly.  As for the text itself, I would recommend this textbook to anyone interested in studying floral design.  It is a good &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; reference for designers so a wise investment!!"

"I bought this camera bag for my t3i 6 months ago. Originally I had a 17-50mm and a 50mm alongside extra batteries and a lens cleaning kit.When I first started out, it was ok at best.Pros:It held my 50mm, 17-50mm, body, my extra batteries, and a charger, as well as various other things.I especially like the side pockets, perfect for the 'extras' I had in my pocket.There are straps on the bottom, and I occasionally kept a small tripod attached to them, which was nice.The bag shows no signs up wear, and appears to be very rugged.I was able to re-arrange the compartments to hold my gear more securely.Cons:The strap clips don't rotate, so I was constantly having to untangle it.The material is abrasive, so don't rub up against it.The bag isn't exactly super-light. It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't great.I quickly ran out of room as I upgraded my kit.The compartment system is a bit odd. It consists of velcro and padded fabric. It holds things in place fairly well, but it rarely maintains the shape I want, so I sort of have to re-arrange it each time I put lenses back.Way too expensive for what I got.Overall, I thought the bag was very too expensive for what I got. I would suggest investing it a low-key off-brand bag for your camera, and to steer clear of this one. Unless you only need a back-up bag, and don't mind spending too much money on it."
"This video is great you can chose.a complete workout you want to do. You can chose between a 15 Or 30 minute workout."
"I have always been terrified about cancer.  Mr. Martin took the fear away when he forced me to stand by him and go through very detailed descriptions of the treatments and outcome of those treatments.  Although I was not in the room with him, his writing made me feel as though I was there in the treatment room with him.  I sat down in early evening and started reading. It got later and later but I could not leave Mr. Martin alone.  Even though my insides were shaking and tears were running down my face, I knew I had to keep reading and learning and supporting Mr. Martin. This book is truly a must read for people who felt like I did about cancer.  After experiencing life with cancer through Mr. Martin's eyes, I know I can beat it.  I am no longer as afraid and I once was and I commend Mr. Martin for his courage to share all the most personal intimate details of this horrific trip he took to beat cancer.  With the knowledge he shares in this book, it will help you in your battle with cancer. Thank You Mr. Martin."
"Wolf Mountain is exciting and keeps your attention. It has a great story that will surprise you and will keep you reading long after you thought you would stop. Mr. Martin has a knack for taking you to places in ways that you can' t see coming."
"My husband loved the kit. It's practical and compact. We like that the bag doubles as a road reflector, an added layer of safety."
"My husband being a tall guy we always buy &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; work shirts for him, this was the first time we bought Hanes brand, and it will be the last. They are not much longer if at all longer than the regular Hanes shirts. They are also much less comfortable than other brands we've bought."
"The item worked great but I found it quickly became useless if, like me, you plan to build a stash of milk. It just doesn't hold enough bags. With full 5oz bags it might hold 10."
"I expected that I was buying rooster feathers, but when I got them they were not feathers at all, but more like hair extensions - i'd rather buy something like this at Hot Topic."
"Subwaysurfers is a very good at a lot of good attempt said Fred Thompson and i know it is a very good at a lot of people who are not the Christmas carols and i know"
"So the screen itself is OK. it is an actual screen. Very grainy though but it does the job. The back of the screen is black so no light is going to pass through it which to some is good to some its not. it is heavy and sturdy and that is the sad part too. The spring or the coil that is supposed to keep the screen rolled up is very very weak. So once I am done using the screen if i roll it up it still drops/rolls down quite a bit. there is a metal or wooden rod that is in the bottom of the screen. It is supposed to keep the vinyl in shape and stretched. This rod is very heavy and the coil cant bear its weight so it unwinds. Defeats the purpose of roll down screens. If the coil worked i would give this 5 stars.The arrangement i have is i have used L brackets to hang this from the wall over my window. The whole idea was to use the screen when needed and else roll it up to let light come through the window. now since its half way rolled down; i cant seem to utilize my window. Anyways the set up is very heavy and i lost the box so cant even return it. but if you have other options i would look elsewhere. This screen is cheap for a reason."
"well like most divers, lost my snorkel. the mask is good. At some places it does have those pointy left over plastic that is going to rub against your face and might hurt but once you use a pair of scissors and remove it; you are good to go. The snrokel came loose and i lost it."
"It doesnt really secure the go pro that well even after you hear a click. i was diving with this and my hand must have hit something and the go pro slipped out. So i see a sting ray and want to take a picture, the go pro was gone! luckily i traced back and found it but you might not get this lucky if you were say snorkeling. Later on i  attach another lanyard to the go pro screw and attach the lanyard to my hand. Tested this again and if something hits the go pro it slips out. Whats the point? It isnt as tough as the go pro is."
"Love the style and it's made well. It holds everything I need. Very comfortable to carry. Great price and got it faster than expected."
"We bought several diamondbacks last year and have enjoyed the nice ride, workmanship and design. A very functional bike with a lot of hop ups that are of high quality and catch others eyes."
"Slight defect - case face bent when received, tried to bend back but thought it would degrade the water tight seal"
"Too bulky however quality of material and workmanship was great. For someone who does not care about size of case"
"I saw this embossing done on a card on you tube and just had to have it.  It embosses the clouds where as they really do pop.  I received this folder in minimum amount of time, what a great product."
"I know this book deserves a five because it had amazing vocabulary, awesome story lines,  and infinite suspense. I would recommended this book to ANYONE that can read and comprehend (READ the previous book as in the series)."
"This book earned five stars because it covered everything. It was exciting, sad, and kept you wondering what Janie would do next. This book goes inside what it is like to be thoroughly alone, an undercover cop in a high school setting, it shows the dangers if date-rape drugs, and what it is like to lose you mentor. I recommend this book to ANYONE THAT CAN READ !"
"The case has everything you need in a case. The fit is perfect, the slim fit is whats desired, the case has a nice feel and look to it. The stand works just as it should, standing up sturdy in each of the slots. I have had no problems with it and it looks like there wont be any. Handles all the daily use very well."
"As in most productions concerning Jerry Garcia and his bands this one was specially good and interesting. A most enjoyable purchase."
"Item came in a timely fashion, and I enjoy wearing it. It is represented perfectly and looks great on. I get compliments on it all the time. The hand inside is small, but that's what I was expecting, and I like that. It catches people's eyes and they always want to get a better look. The metal is highly polished and the chain is very nice. A++"
"I first purchased this shoe in navy. It was so incredibly comfortable, and looked amazing with ankle-length pants, that I HAD to purchase the red as well.  Just be careful of the patent - covered heel. Once the back catches on something and the heel gets scraped, there is no way to touch it up or fix it."
"Ok just doing this for the extra points because usually I don't do reviews but I gotta hand it to them the game is pretty awesome. The only problem is the controls. It will take a while to get used to them."
"Great book, every since the first book I've really been hooked. It is truly an amazing series, from the first two books I've read, I've loved them both."
"This book was full of passion and love. I really enjoyed reading it! Reading this book is a must do!"
"Great book! Great storyline!"
"Before watching the life of Brian episode I would of gave Season 12 a 5 star rating, I was intrigued by the New style of there episodes... I'v been a die hard Family Guy fan since Y2K, I bought all the episodes on Xbox live marketplace, and amazon Kindle, the reason I loved the show so much was because of Brian and Stewie together, the time travel episodes were the best... I would consider Seth McFarlen an artist, and I'm not going to jump the gun here, but it would be stupid to keep this Vinny character, it would ruin Family Guy for me and many other loyal fans... I really truly hope to see Stewie fix his time machine and save Brian... I honestly don't think I could keep watching family guy without Brian as a character..."
"it look very different from the picture than real life. It is a bit smaller and kind of look like a girl bracelet insteand"
"It came in a little bit late but not too early too and i thought it might be bigger but its ok"
"Good product but doesnt fit into the US plugs sometimes. I need few more but I'll try some other providers.Thanks."
"I was really frustrated with my old cube.. I had to often lubricate it with Vaseline or some other lubricants like Heavy Duty Silicon.... When I received it I was really amazed to see its smoothness... I thought it must be lubricated with some liquid so its moving fast  and with time it'll again become slower... But I was wrong its still in same condition as it was when I got it....Moves really  fast....Just go for it...!!!"
"I am in love with this series. Having little teasers like this is wonderful. I am really looking forward to the third book. Thank you for a great read!!!"
"This case is stylish and very durable....Great price along with a great look.  This is a Perfect case for my college-aged son."
"These sunglasses work if you are looking in the same direction of the sun, however, if the sun is to the side of you it completely blind whatever eye is that way. For an example, if the sun is to the left of you, you can't see out of your left eye. Well you get what you pay for."
"First of all, these gloves have a terrible bulkiness, making it hard to function the bike controls, and its just not comfortable. Also, they weren't warm enough for me. Wore them in 30 degree weather, for a 10 minute ride. My fingers were frozen! Would not suggest this for cold weather under 40 degrees."
"This product is great! Very Satisfied!Pros:-Very Bright-Good Adhesive on the pods-WaterproofCons:-Connectors are practically useless"
"This knife comes out very quickly and swiftly once you get the hand of it. I gave it to my friend as a gift and he didn't get the swing of it very quickly and cut his thumb a couple of times haha, but I had no problems with it. Survival of the fittest I guess."
"This Quick Charge Kit does what it says! The battery packs also last for a long time, the only thing unfortunate about this is that it only comes with one battery pack. I would suggest getting the play and charge kit along with this to get another battery pack and also the play and charge is very convenient."
"You can't tell from the pictures, but there is a glass case back, so you can see it work from behind too! Which I really like. Howver there is &amp;#34;China&amp;#34; on the back which is kind of dumb.I love almost everything about it except for the band.The band is very cheap, and it pulls at my hairs when I put it on. However, you can switch the band."
"Got them to go with my Halloween costume. They're nice, good material, fit my fingers well. I have kinda long fingers and there is some space so if you have small hands these might not be for you. I'll use them for more than Halloween for sure!"
"Very accurate, easy to read, quality is excellent. Made in the USA. The price is cheaper than the Starrett. Mitutoyo  is an excellent product."
"i have used these razors for years and will continue to as long as they are in production. I have burn scars (2nd degree) and makes it hard to shave,but with these i shave with no hassle at all!"
"i should have went with a dark roast. i like a medium roast, but with these i have to put 2 in to make it taste like a medium roast. i wish they still sold these in stores where i live."
"This sauce is amazing! i had a friend let me try it and now i'm hooked! will end up buying it by the case next time!"
"i have 3 of these now, and they work great! they have saved my battery lives and saved me money! would definitely recommend everyone to have one if they have a mower, atv, etc that might sit for a few weeks at a time"
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother and he loves it! would definitely recommend! no complaints so far!"
"These lights were super easy to install and work great! Came packaged with plenty of bubble wrap and everything! Definately recommend these... Especially for the price!"
"This flashlight is awesome!! I use it for hunting and it shines through the woods like crazy! I had one a couple years back but left the batteries in it all year and the inside started to corrode. But it was so good I ordered another one! The batteries last a long time in them too! Small and compact... Perfect for anywhere!"
"sharp edges on the bar should have been rounded off a little. the sharp edges will cut your hand if you're not careful. but the tool does the job!"
"Cosplay worthy pin, did meet all my expectations, only problem is that the pin falls of easily. Fast shipping in a ok box with no damage to product"
"Not bad,but not that good.Cheap price and not bad quality.I like it. but  not so much.Recommand to the poor like me lol"
"i like it so much, i hope Kuhn Rikon is available in my place in the future keep it up the good quality and company image thank you.."
"It was simple to assemble and light weight. The only down fall: you have to be careful in how you pack it in the vehicle or where you put it (I thought I was careful), but when it came to taking it out for use (the back part of where the baby sits) curved in (toward the back of my baby) and so did the flap at the bottom of the stroller (where things are stored), also the storage at the bottom (it's hard to fit anything in there. I don't leave it in my vehicle (so it couldn't have been because of the Texas heat). But other than this, I like the stroller. Since there were no reviews when I bought this, I took my chances... If I can go back, I would have bought another one that I was looking into."
"i highly recommend this to everyone either for private or public use.sound very clear and loud.and price is very good."
"I finding ..easily torn in the under.soso ^^;;I'll just be coated.Quality is good.^^ thank you. ^^"
"Little thicker than the color screen.Still wear haeboni too OohMaterial doubt a very good thing, butSatisfied with the money."
"very good item, and wears comfortable as expected. I'd like to recommend it to my friends and all those who need."
"I bought this for my grandson, age 7 1/2. Not a great reader, he would much prefer to use his Kindle for game playing. However, after a brief chat about the protagonist of this book, he settled down to actually READ it, and was soon engrossed. I read the book prior to gifting it, and found it delightful, fun, engaging and smile-producing, without a touch of sanctimoniousness."
"This has rightly been included towards the top of the New York Times best children's books of 2013. I bought it for a 5-year-old granddaughter. She may be a bit old for it, but I think she will love the story."
"Since the age of 14, this was my favorite Dickens novel. Having just reread it for the first time in probably 20 years, I  recognize the overt theatricality and floridness of the book, but accept those as part of its period. Dickensian truly captured the horror of the time. His characters, while certainly larger than life, are amazingly well drawn and colorful. I even found myself, once again, tearing up with Sydney Carton's final speech."
"As a lover of fairytales and legends, I found this book to be both fascinating and frustrating. I know I shall have to reread it at least two more times before I understand all the nuances, innuendos and references. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying the stories and progression of the book."
"The first person voice was well crafted. I enjoyed meeting Big Pete. His cell mate, however, could have been crafted with a Littleton detail. Overall, I certainly enjoyed this book."
"I bought this as a present for an active granddaughter, and it immediately became THE gift. All the kids had to try it, and try it again, and play the music to dance to... However, as with any toy that makes noise, the electronic music became an irritant to some adults after awhile."
"Came just how it looks its amazing and bright we gave it as a Christmas present and they loved it"
"Five Stars For Amazon Rekindling That Fire That Netflix Tryed To Extinguish (in my eyes) This ain't an unbiased review at all ima DIE Hard Rugrats Fan"
"She Really Talks To Anyone Who Is Listening. I Like Her Lifestyle Of Just Not Caring. I Recommend This To Anyone Whose A Fan Of The Punk Princess Avril Lavigne"
"In this case I agree, the first season of my little pony was the best and I'm pretty sure anyone else would agree THAT they shouldn't/couldn't have done it any other way. Which would make people wonder how they are gonna attempt to try to live up with the huge success of the first season. Well just ask the fans how they did. From the beginning of it to the end of it. Boy did they do it up right. I love every single last episode and then there are ones you can't live without."
"Its an amazing book! Makes you think about a lot of the stuff that goes on around us and what the future might come to. Got here within a couple days. Loved it !"
"I think this is a fun, fast paced game. I'm 21 years old and play, I've passed it around the family and they all seemed to like it and laugh about it too. Teenagers, toddlers, and elderly alike!"
"The phases don't go in order so if you are not paying attention right before you begin, you can't tell what phase you are on. You can't pause to find out either. Very confusing and not like the real card game."
"This is an ok read if you are bored. It is Short. Not good if you want something interesting or imaginative."
"My three year old can search through and watch shows on his own. He loves the ease and the great shows!"
"bought this so he could turn the screen if kindle and drive his &amp;#34;car&amp;#34;. there's no turning at all. just a straight road. it's horrible and he won't play it cause it bores him."
"The hole in the bead is so small my size 12 needle couldn't even pass through twice without breaking the bead in half. This happened on numerous beads."
"Hey it's a crossover cable. What else can I say? It works and works well. Good price for the length. Well worth the buy."
"Maybe one of the best mouse I've ever purchased next to the madcatz ones. Really high dpi and the adjustment control is what I needed to game on Eyefinity."
"Pros: Can be used as an AP, Router, or Repeater. 4 SSID's (Guests) and option to limit bandwidth. Rang far exceeds expectations which was my MAIN issue :). Easy to use GUI and to updates are easy and painless to install.Cons: LED indicator lights aren't as bright but not a big issue.Other thoughts: Using it as an Access Point linked up to original router via Powerline. Signal is great as I can reach it from the opposite side of a split level house as well as the basement. The GUI itself is really easy to navigate and self explanatory if you've never done that sort of thing before. 4 ssids are awesome to seperate the kids if one only reads books online or when playing games. Not the best router for streaming HD video but we had 5 devices with youtube going at 720p there were no issues. So far so good I say. If you're looking for something cheap and it works this is it."
"PRO: Does everything you need it to. Powerlines are a great alternative to wireless networking as long as your electric circuitry isn't all screwed up and they are paired. Great data rates :)CONS: Being in a split level house doesn't help this device at all. Reason why I took a star off is that it drops being paired once a week and is very annoying. Tested with another location with only one floor and the issue still remained.Other thoughts: I like it and I don't mind re-pairing it from time to time. Just wished I didn't have to do that but otherwise it's awesome."
"It's well worht the price. My grandson's favorite color is lime green and this pillow is the perfect color for hi. He loved it."
"The straps underneath the foot are uncomfortable, but then I was thinking that maybe that's to be expected.  Otherwise, they fit well.  I am a size nine/ten shoe in women's depending on the brand name and the x-large fit me very well.  I am happy with the shoe overall."
"Excellent delivery service, product arrived before expected, and the leash tape is a very bright, visible-in-evening yellow. However, unlike the product description states, the leash housing (what you hold onto) is not reflective, it's just silver and shiny. And unlike with my other Flexi leashes, this one has no 1-2ft. non-retractable extension hanging out; i.e. when your dog is standing next to you, this leash still ""pulls,"" while other Flexi leashes have 1-2ft of limp leash that won't retract into the housing. That's a great thing because the leash goes slack (and doesn't pull on him or your hand/arm) when your dog is right next to you at a crosswalk or whatever.  Still, this is a great safety leash for evening walking. Just wish the housing itself was bright and reflective. I bought two of these leashes and I've received comments on them from passersby. Most importantly, at night cars can see that your dog is ON a leash."
"So creative and funny. Loved the many twists and turns of this story and the clever way in which the author wove history into the craziness that was this man's life!"
"I'm currently reading this as a book club choice and not enjoying it at all. Maybe because (luckily) I'm not in a position to understand the trials and tribulations of dealing with a sick old parent. I felt the author whined constantly and showed her worst side in this book. In parts she almost seemed mean to her mother. I'm not sure which parts people were reading that were humorous. I certainly haven't found them. Utterly depressing and dull. I don't think I'll finish it, which is almost unheard of for me! Looking forward to hearing what my fellow bookclub members think..."
"Very comfortable material. Wish they sold this as a separate top and separate pants. Pants were true to size. Top fit too snug. Unfortunately, I'll have to return it."
"The keyboard cover fits the keyboard perfectly and always keeps crumbs out. The cover itself is also great, could fit a little more snugly on top, but other than that it is good."
"I want to like it so much, but I just can't do it. It is way too bulky. It is 6 1/4 inches wide and 8 3/4 inches long, in my opinion that is just way too bulky. I really need it so I am going to keep it, since I always get yelled at that there is no toilet paper. I will update in a few months if it rusts or anything changes."
"I got this 3-in-1 Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler to try for free via a program run by Gillette. I was excited to try this styler. I can nicely trim my beard and goatee with this trimmer. It is a breeze with this trimmer. it is the perfect size for me to trim. I get a perfect shape every time. There is one thing I don't like, and that is because the hair clogs up everything and it takes quite a while to clean them, but for a trimmer this great it doesn't bother me too much.  I would defiantly recommend this to everyone who is looking for a great trimmer. I can shave and trim my goatee with out taking another three razors in my hand. I can do it all with one styler."
"I must have gotten a good one. I bought it for myself to put it in my purse, but my awesome fianc&amp;eacute; decided he needed it. He uses it a lot  and it still works great. I bought it about 4 months ago."
"I received this from Influenster to try for free. I liked it but I did not love it. I does make your teeth somewhat whiter but it leaves a weird taste and feeling in my mouth. It is also a bit pricy. I would recommend it to friends, but I don't think I will buy any for myself, but I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste. So it could just be me."
"The &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34; is coming off of the four small spice jars and they are NOT air tight at all, not even remotely air tight. The canisters are very difficult to close and not airtight either. I would defiantly not buy these again. I would recommend paying a little more and actually get something for your money. These canisters were not made to use, they are for decorations.  I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews, they are telling the truth!!"
"I LOVE this. It is just too funny! I gave this to my fianc&amp;eacute; for a stocking stuffer at Christmas. He saw this in pictures a few times and thought he just had to have one. I told him to make sure he never tells anyone from who he got it from since it is a little inappropriate, but very funny."
"This has helped my shoulder pain subside whenever I take the pills. I am taking the maximum dose and although I do not take them every day they work when I consume them. I have not found any joint pills that have helped me s much as these have!"
"These razor blades are so much better price here than I was buying for at my local store. I love these razors as they give me the closest shave with no abrasions or red marks afterwards. They also last me a long time since I only shave once a day."
"My boyfriend ordered this for me as part of a costume to wear to the local renaissance festival, so I'm reviewing from his account. I'm about 5'9, 125 pounds, wear a size 2-4. The skirt came down to just brushing the tops of my sneakers when I tried it on, so it might be a bit long for women of average or short height. Even though the tag says one size fits all, it fit my hips without falling off or slipping, yet had enough stretch to it to comfortably fit the more full-figured ladies out there without any bothersome pinching, as other reviews have stated.  It was really comfortable and flowy, the brick red color looked great with the peasant blouse I wore, and the slip layer covered all of my assets, despite how sheer it looked in the photos. My only complaint being that the color bled A LOT when first washed and I am now the proud owner of 5 pink shirts and 12 pairs of pink socks."
"this is the best game ever.I give it a definer five star rating.and the reason why I love it is because you get to do anything. you want to do like make her look amazing or make her look like a super star."
"the charger slot doesnt fit the charger, so I have to take it off the phone every time I need to charge it."
"It works in a pinch but way to tight to put back in its holster once you take it out"
"This was such a great book. I am sad it ended but I can start all over and relive it again."
"I was looking for something new to read a while back and I just happend to find thie fated saga series I could not stop reading it is so great and after I was done with book 1 and found that there were many I was so happy it is an amazing series I recoment it to everyone."
"I had wanted this set for quite a while and when I found it at the discounted price I grabbed it.  I love the way these dies make an image look when making cards.  I LOVE it."
"Not my favorite, but still awesome and pretty amazing considering their age and the fact that they hadn't been a band in over 30 years"
"Enjoyed it as I got to watch KY play in the final four and now championship game tonight.! Best app ever, highly recommend."
"I really enjoyed this book. Surprise ending as always. Closed out really well. It was kinda slow at the beginning, but developed at a slow pace."
"Good book, but short. I read it in one day. Good plot and story line, would recommend if you like something different."
"I got this camera for my daughter's b-day.  She loves it and got great shots.Also the case really is cool and original!!!"
"I loved this book and can't wait for part 2. Please get it out for the readers as soon as possible."
"The book is like all the others like the was a old lady who swallowed a fly and other iBooks"
"Hello peeps the name is awesomeness and the only thing I can see the only one that I am looking for"
"I have very fine hair and this is a great product that does not weight my hair down. LOVE IT"
"Product Worked like it Should it would Take 12 to 15 Hour's in temps below 40-50 deg.now it only takes 7-9  very pleased."
"my favorite case ever i swear to go this is the best case ever lol i love spongebob im a spongebob feen im always watching it when i found this case i went alittle crazy lol"
"IT CUTE and everything but the red just getts dirty fast and it hard to put on the phone D:"
"We love the Blue Ocean 52&amp;#34; shower tower.  The Rainfall showerhead makes taking a shower even more enjoyable and the temperature control is great."
"Again, a beginner so I don't speak for quality but they work just fine! They did seem to come loose but I don't know if that's just a trait of cheap boots??"
"I work as a welder in a steel fabrication shop. I do a lot of arc gouging and welding and after a year these boots are still in great shape.  They were easy to break in and were comfortable from the first day. They are steel toe and metaltarsal is built on inside which is one reason I bought them. When these wear out I will be getting another pair. I highly recomend these boots."
"Perfect fit feels great well worth it"
"good story to help kid understand more about empathy. I give it 4 star because it is a bit wordy that kids can lose interest halfway through the book...but very good illustration and I would still recommend this book."
"This is a good item to have for emergency.It is compact,strong has many uses.All a ta price that is reasonable."
"It was nice to get a logo hat for the price it was.Usually logo wear is very expensive.Nice quality too."
"A 2 year old could make perfect pizzelles with this its so easy!I would advise all my friends to get this brand."
"very good definitely a must buy, and thats enough to say, thats it, just buy it now, bye bye :)"
"I despaired,the dress is cute, but it have three hole between waist!!Can I back it from china?waitting for your restore"
"This product was exactly what I was looking for. If you are looking for a large backpack for hunting, backpacking, or working out this would be the one. good delivery time to-Go Army Beat Navy!"
"purchased 2 of them for my sons rooms and they are great. for the price of them they are better then what I expected them to be. My sons love them. they sound good picture is good and overall quality is good. recommend them for kids rooms or for extra tv."
"exactly what he wanted and it was exactly as described. Came quick and every thing when very smooth. love it"
"I purchased 2 of these for my boys xmas presents. the first one wouldn't close on the top and then it broke 2days later. The other one fits his phone but u cant hear him when u call his ohone. Its blocks the speakers and his cracked also. Total waste of money. JUNK!!!!"
"Very nice n warm robe. Very good quality. I love the hood on those cold days. Got a few sizes bigger i could wear it over my clothes also. Very pleased!"
"This is an amazing story!! Thanks Jenni and her Family for sharing with us. Love you an  miss you very much RIP Dive"
"excellent shoes, they feel soft at walking and stable, great material and colour. they look lovely with jeans or even smarter pants. Good purchase and price!"
"It fits just right, just to wear with a thin tee below. I love pockets and the one it has a bit hidden in the waist is perfect. The colour is nice too."
"Wonderful colour and texture.It fits elegant with a pair of office pant and also informal but chic with jeans. The fabric is not heavy and falls great."
"I love my uggs.  They are super warm and fuzzy.  If I wear them ALL day (I work from home), my feet feel like I'm walking on concrete, but great for not walking around in all day :)"
"All the neighborhood kids can see it I don't mind being the guy they think is paranoid. This sign prevents stupid acts."
"Needs more air space and mounting depth than pioneer ip-flat subs. Not truly a flat sub little less mounting depth. Was surprised to see a magnet on back. Pioneer definitely has this beat."
"They sell it at Walmart in camping area no difference in material at all. Price not far off but this product is made well."
"It was okay i have no completes. I expected everything I bought. Took me only a about half an hour to finish on project. I bought this to build a 3D model for my science project and I could not be happier. I am I will be getting a 100 on that."
"Not a bad read. Better than l thought. I did figure it out about half way through. All in all it kept my attention for the duration of this book."
"Always a great read. Deaver always makes you think. His characters are believable and you feel you know them and could be best friends."
"I had a good read with this book. Am very glad that l have this classic finished. Now the movie."
"This book was well written. Mrs. Gray took me through the pain of losing a child and the joy of finding him again through others."
"Deaver is always a good read. The story had me guessing all the way to the end. Next one please."
"the sound was fuzzy and the quality was low, I do not recommend. the only good thing was it arrived fast!"
"ARE YOU JOKING ME.... the doll does not look like this... not the same outfit... hair crazy not in a braid... I am so mad right now...."
"I haven't gotten the chance to read this book yet, but I saw the movie and I am very excited. This book was about $5 and I believe it was worth it."
"Wanted this for my laptop bag and it fits great. Seeing Urahara everyday with his smiling face is a great thing to see! I am very pleased!"
"This is a delightful buy, as I am typing this review I am wearing it now. Just one thing to be aware of is the color, it comes darker than expected."
"Started peeling after a couple of days, did not fit the device correctly.Was not able to open the slide with this case."
"I have tried just about every name brand sunglass out and none compare to the fit of Bolle's. I have a pair of Costas which cost me 200 plus and I am scared to wear them because they scratch so easily.As many stated, yes they are a very large pair of shades, but if you have a bog noggin and like the coverage they provide against the sun on the Water then these are for you. I work in the Gulf and nothing compares. I have owned Bolle's in the past and been sold on the quality and lasting durability for years.Here's the but, the float head piece does not fit over the ear section of the sunglasses, so it's useless and I really wanted to use it. I drive boats and I have had sunglasses fly off before to be lost for ever.Bolle, you need to send the correct head float with these sunglasses."
"I watched the gold box timer like most of you and when it reached zero i rapidly clicked on it, saw the price and went straight to check out. I look at it like this, if you was one of those people who needed to see specs first, you missed out on a 50 inch TV for 288 dollars. I don't care what brand it is, for that price and yes Walmart customers have given this TV decent reviews for twice the amount. This won't be my family TV, perfect for a game room.. Man cave.My TV gets here on Friday and I will update.You can always clear it out of in box if you didn't want it. Just my opinion."
"Ring is great for what I paid for it!! It's perfect for working conditions like outside. Will get another one soon."
"does what it suppose to, I have use this product over 20 years on all my bows and cross bows"
"Took with CAMBOGIA and I lost 10 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks eating what I normally do. That gave me the push to cut out soda, then lost 10 more. Since seeing actual results I'm trying to eat healthier. Pills do not make you jittery or gassy/poopy"
"I have only played it a couple times, which I like what I have played. My daughter rea;ly likes it."
"Love this game! Slow generating coins at first but when you get to higher levels it's not too bad. Was on level 100 then had to swap out my kindle and even after syncing I lost all my prizes and started at level 1! Really mad I spent money to get coins, don't think I'll do that again just incase I have another problem with my kindle."
"The size guide is precise, and the boots is very cozy, just like wearing sneaker.More comfortable than the Danner Mountain Boots."
"I really like games with monsters but it just got me so happy when I saw Fire it takes skill to .fight love it"
"Good game for kids and others and also it is good to spare some time with this great game 5 &amp;yen; out of 5 &amp;yen;  Good game &amp;yen;&amp;yen;&amp;yen;&amp;yen;&amp;yen;"
"So much easier than floppy bird so better so I live this game already so I decide u play this game k"
"I loved the look of it but I wish I would have got a larger size. It is still very cute though."
"I like this shirt it fits perfect and just tucking in the bottom a little makes it look so good!"
"I am a fan.  I just love these game.  There is just one thing I wish they would fix and that is the animation to get in and out of vehicles. Sims2 is much better here."
"This is a great pastime for my kids.... We travel a lot so this little game is a good way to pass the time."
"It is very dangerous for band students to be out with their brass instruments in the summer months when thunderstorms are nearby. This app is a great way of telling us if we should practice on the field or not...great app."
"She has spent countless hours drawing on her bamboo tablet.  Now when she is done, she neatly and safely stick it away!!!"
"This was my 9 year old son's Christmas present. I priced them at the music stores.  They were very expensive.  This one was a good price.  It came just before Christmas and packaged nicely.  It doesn't take up a lot of room.  The guitars (3 different sizes)don't fall out...which is a good thing  :-)  I would highly recommend it!"
"its been a while since I've run into a singer with such power in her voice. her songs are well written, too."
"It's pretty amazing considering this is the first laptop I have bought in five years. The startup is quick and smooth, the keyboard has large font and a non-slippery feel which is lovely, the touchpad responses well enough no sensitivity issues. I'm amazed by how quickly the programs open up and how efficient it moves from one program to the next.The weight isn't very heavy, its compact, the battery is easily removable and having a CD/DVD drive is a plus. Of course Windows 7 has an excellent interface I'm familiar with and its very user-friendly. Overall its a great product, I've had no problems after the first couple of days and the shipping was fast and the laptop was in mint condition no flaws as far as I could tell. Also the speakers are better than I was expecting it, it can get pretty loud and the screen is perfect for watching movies, great resolution.One of the best selling points about Toshiba is their extra applications such as the PC Health Monitor, which was a lifesaver on my last laptop it tells you basic info about the CPU temperature, fan speed, battery life status which is a simple way of monitoring the over health of your laptop and tracking its decline.I would say this laptop is best if you are looking for a device to keep up with your internet browsing, watching movies and listening to music and doing moderate use of applications such as MS Office etc. Excellent choice for a student!"
"I recommend this game to people who love minecraft! its a fun way to build stuff and the world is full of blocks lol!"
"Did not think I needed a griddle, now I use it all the time. Removable handles are useful for storage. Watch out for eggs sliding off into the sink, has a slick surface."
"i still waiting for my stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hope come late if not i want my money back!!! always late i am tired!!!"
"My husband likes this product and has used it off and on for 30 years. He says that it is the only thing that makes his hair lay down without feeling greasy or stiff. He ran out recently (a little goes a long way) and we could not find it locally. So off to the internet we go.  After searching, we decided to buy it from Amazon."
"I bought this case for my 13 year old daughter and she loved it. She got a lot compliments from her friends. I would recommend this product for anyone thats looking for a good case"
"I had a old Projector and many different devices with different output connectors.Now everything is plugged in :):0"
"Neurotic hitman John Cusack, what more could you wantBest line of the whole movie.....in regards to a high school reunion- &amp;#34;It's as if everybody swelled&amp;#34;"
"Works as a great base layer or by itself, gets a little itchy when the weather turns warm.  Easy to clean, packs small."
"Haven't used it yet, but the last one lasted about 4 months.  My parents leave the TV on all the time. Does that effect the warrenty time?"
"it likes to go offlinelot adou have to start over a lot. is there something wrong ois it just the chnolog"
"Love the packaging of this coffee. Seems to brew just fine with the Keurig.  I think it has a great taste and should be part of my norm.  Hope others will support organic coffee! (-:"
"use it on tablet that I bought hook it up to 3 piece speaker set works andsounds great . the length works for movement"
"Fits in my alumi-wallet and has ok tools in case. But wouldn't rely on it for serious emergencies. Fun gift but just a trinket."
"You need to have done alot of 3d wood puzzles to even begin to handle this. It has no instruction only the number guide and 705 pieces. It took me a month of sanding, fitting, painting, and glueing a little everyday between everyday life. Looks awesome and it is big. Now I have nowhere to display because it's so big but it is the best 3d puzzle i have done. If you love the wood puzzlesand have the time give this a shoot. Worth the $$$$"
"I have 23 combination wrenches and thought I couldn't find a roll up big enough. This came fairly quick and this fits my tools with room to spare for sockets and screwdrivers. Great quality and the carrying handle and the lock clips are even better. Good buy. I recommend."
"Best movie. Great fights. Awesome technique. Great great great. If you like martial art films then this is one for sure. Great buy."
"This runs with the meep which is the worst tablet ever built. This microphone isn't even needed because the meep has a tiny pin hole microphone on it and can hear you say the commands. Dust collector."
"This was almost $20  cheaper than walmart and it came days before christmas so I could use as a gift. Great series andgreat price. Funny stuff. Ten stars!"
"I can't wait to read the next book about the Anderson family they ate men who love hard and strong"
"For around $10 you can't go wrong with this case. The case has a nice feel to it. It does not feel cheap and is nice and grippy. The case has some soft stuff inside of it. This grips the phone really nicely and protects from scratches on the inside. The screen protector i was using at the time did not fit with this case so i did have to remove it. The reason i gave it 4/5 is because the cutout for the camera is a little large. Also the lock button is a little hard to access with this case. Other than that the cutouts for the buttons are perfect."
"This book keeps you intrigue chapter after chapter. Always wondering what is going to happen in the next chapter; I really loved this one!!!!!!"
"I love my new headset! I can wear it while exercising, washing dishes, doing my housework: and I don't have to worry about it falling out of my ears!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!:)))"
"It is AMAZING!!!!!!! My family loves it: the color the clarity even the moves, totally AWSOME..... Even my daughter loves it&amp;#128525;"
"Awesome!!! I love the multiple ways that you can use to hold your ipad up. And its tough to keep it safe."
"This is a bowed blade and takes to much pressure to do a decent job. used it once and threw it in the trash"
"Bought this as an introduction to the Narnia world for my little nephew. Was in very good condition, very please with product."
"I was worried about the tulle quality being low but, to my surprise, it's actually pretty good material. I am using this to make a Harley Quinn cosplay tutu and it was plenty to achieve the look I need. Will be buying different colors in the near future!"
"EXTREMELY sheer. If you are looking for some sort of shield against sunlight this is not the curtain for you. It matched perfectly with what I was going for in my bedroom. Not the best material, it was a little frayed on some spots but nothing terribly noticeable."
"I got these lights to hang in my room as an alternate light source. When I first took them out of the package I was very skeptical but once I plugged them in I really liked them. They are the beautiful cool blueish-white lights that I was looking for. I strung them up behind sheer white curtains, on my wall, and it looks absolutely beautiful! Wish I could share a photo. Everyone that has seen my bedroom setup tells me that it looks so relaxing and calming with the way I have everything. I also put up a canopy to finish the look I was going for and the lights shine beautifully bright behind the layers of fabric. I am in love with my bedroom! The lights give off enough light to move about and eliminate the need to always have my bigger lights on. My only issue was that the plug looked kinda weird and was a little loose in the socket but I easily fixed that my bending the prongs a little out ward and it fits perfectly now. I just ordered 3 more sets of lights."
"Was listed as used but looked brand spankin' new! Love this case, had so many people compliment how sleek and stylish my phone looks in it. Very happy customer that it also came so fast!"
"The rotors are even and balanced well.  They perform well and so far I have no issues with these.  I know people spend a lot of money for brake rotors if you're going to spend money on your brake system, spend it on some high quality brake pads.  These rotors get the job done and they don't need all the fancy bells and whistle to do it.  The price is great and really hard to beat.  They came packaged as they should, in a box and wrapped in plastic.  When they leave the factory, they put an anti-rust treatment on the rotors so it's recommended you clean that off before installation with some brake cleaning fluid.  I installed them and my brakes have been much improved.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs new brake rotors."
"I bought this for my wife so she can wear it around without fear of losing her wedding ring and she loves it!  It's quite heavy for it's size and to me, that speaks of it's quality.  So far it's proven to be of quality material and craftsmanship, as it's resistant to scratches  and the finish is amazing.  Some people pay several hundred dollars for a simple band like this and I'm not sure why.  You can get this for a fraction of that and still have the quality people associate with the higher price rings.  Don't be afraid to make this purchase if you need a band or just another ring to wear in place of a wedding ring.  It's great quality and for this price, you cannot get anything better.  I would recommend this to anyone."
"This screen protector is great!  The protector is slick and it doesn't change the way your screen feels after you've applied the screen protector.  I'm not a fan of the matte, non glare screen protector because it takes away from the slick feel of the glass.  I can deal with the glare if the screen protector feels like the glass, and it does.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a screen protector and isn't looking for the non glare protectors.  You can't beat this product for the price."
"This amp is amazing and for that price, it just doesn't seem right.  But it is and the amp is great.  I'm pairing the amp with an Alpine 1043d sub and this thing makes the sub sound incredible.  I don't even have the gain turned up on the amp, I'm just using the EQ settings on my head unit and it sounds amazing.  If I wanted to, I could turn up the gain and rattle some windows, I'm more concerned about quality bass sound and this amp gives me that.  I've yet to have any issues with the amp as it doesn't get too hot even after pushing it.  This thing can handle it.  Highly recommended to anyone looking for an amp."
"Love this skirt! I am short--4'11&amp;#34; so finding a maxi skirt that fits is very exciting! But the way the skirt is, it will work if taller as well...you can pull up or even make into a dress...it's comfy and flattering!"
"I really loved reading this! It's a great girl meets boy novel full of lust, and moments of sadness. Madison met Liam and they were immediately attracted to each other and they later on find out that they work with each other! I got to hand it to Christina this was a very well written debut book, if there was any spelling or grammar errors I never caught them because I was too caught up in the book!Two people trying to make something of themselves In the medical field, and they find each other and know things will no longer be the same, they want a no strings attached relationship but that wasn't happening! I was on the verge of tears when Liam left, I was also so mad! He frustrated me at times! I really felt for Maddie. And i also wanted to kill Owen for doing what he did.Overall this was a great debut read and I am REALLY looking forward to seeing what's next for this great author!"
"I recieved these items and they are not acceptable, they are so dirty, that I am not comfortable giving them to the kids, it will take to long to try and clean them. Not happy at all."
"it  is a great game and it shows alot of stuff the others didn't and it is great to play"
"i just love this item and protects my phone from getting dirty and messed up. a great buy and  for the money to."
"i really like how it fits right, good for a warm day and casual ocations u can wear it, cool tshirt"
"like like this headset does i that needed it for great when i'm playing games online mic is just what i needed for vent"
"Fabulous documentary. Really opened my eyes to the abuse of dolphins in Taiji. Makes me want to help the cause even more."
"Not the right one"
"Loved this blouse! Dressier than I thought it would be, very nice quality,and great price. My daughter thought it was comfortable which usually isn't so unless it's a tee."
"I got these for the special colors because water colors seem a little flat to me occasionally.  The twinkling H2Os were perfect.  The shine you get adds something very special to your work."
"After I got the Fuse I read that I could use the best of all the other companies products by purchasing this adapter set.  I couldn't wait!!  It's true... I got some other very complicated cut outs and the Fuse cut them beautifully!  If you're thinking about getting a machine, I recommend the Fuse, it's great!"
"Love Thomas....don't like being woke at 2:40 am to write a review for a movie...Really!  Can you not ask this in the middle of the fay?"
"Awesome...all I expected! These are so comfortable...everyone must have a pair for summer outdoor activities! I love my new flip flops!"
"The book came to my door and packaging was crisp or whatever. Book was solid and I could tell it was new, but the covers were not parallel to each other and the binding was bent. I'm a stickler for small things. The fix was easy but if the book were available in a store near me, I would've purchased it there."
"I do not like is not my thing. So you see expect otherwise.Before I had moved more topics.Also has a great you."
"We haven't had the phones too long but at this time there have been no problems. They are easy to read and easy to program. The clear reception is excellent. We live in an area that seems to be a landlocked &amp;#34;Bermuda Triangle&amp;#34; when it comes to telephone, cell phone and internet reception. So far these phones have performed very well."
"Bought them for my brother who works on oil rigs. He liked them so much he asked me to order some more pairs."
"like reviewers said...armhole is not &amp;#34;the best fit&amp;#34;. But i love the length, love the color and the clothe is soft...i recommend it if you dont care much about your underwear showing a bit."
"Went for 34FF wear it as racerback is better for me than the normal way. more tight and help girls to not bounce as much."
"Ok I really love the shoes and I'm a bit surprise as I red that indigo line run small.true to size but there is something with the toe box that I can't define..And no kiddin' I think it will be beautiful on small feet. Not mine (10M)...It looks weird.I'm so sad coz' I heeeart the design!"
"it's beautiful! but it runs small a bit. half size up will be a better choice.unfortunately I cannot send it back. but really love the look!"
"I really love this concealer palet. I am able to use this through out the year from spring, all the way through winter. It has so many shades. It sometimes creases when I use a primer, so I suggest using it without one. It works great, and conceals really good :) I used the lightest shade as a base for my eye shadow. I am going to purchase again. Its my everyday concealer."
"For the price I paid you really cant beat it. They are comfy and are not cheap at all. I would purchase again. :)"
"I received the phone case on time as expected. Although I was somewhat upset that 5 of the crystals had already fallen out. I suspect this is either from poor handling while shipping, or poor gluing from the company. The color of the case is wonderful and all my friends ask where I bought it. I love the leopard design and fur texture, but really wish the crystals weren't falling out so quickly. Recommended for young to teenage girls for any event!"
"I received this in the mail on time as stated in absolute excellent condition. It fits my boyfriends 3GS perfectly with no odd pieces sticking out or sharp edges. The camo is exactly like the picture states and the two pieces fit together the way they should! I recommend this to anyone who has a brother, dad, boyfriend, or husband that likes camouflage!! (:"
"These screen protectors are good if you want basic care of your screen. As in you just want it to keep your screen from having scratches and fingerprints. It isn't anything fancy, just a plain Jane screen protector. But it did fit well &amp; if you know what your doing you shouldn't have bubbles. I would recommend this because of its price. It's well worth what you pay."
"Story is well written, acting is very good.  I love the old mansions and that time in history. Thank you"
"I got a surprise with this set of stories, story line great, but  the sex was a bit much . I guess i am  just a little too old to enjoy that much sex or is that I am too tired.  sigh but the story was good."
"don't know why people rate it as 1. a rating below 5 is an insult to the game. the game is great, i played it and there seems to be no problem at all. Waiting for your next turn may take some time but it gives you a rest. the graphic is great, the battle is fun. it is really a 5 star."
"Very good product. I recommend it. Is you are looking for a mount this is a good alternative. Only bad: too heavy."
"Very good product. I recommend it. Is you are looking for a good projector this is a amazing alternative. No doubt."
"very good quality material. Although I haven't worn it yet but, I cant wait to wear it! I ordered a medium due to previous reviews gave me the idea that I shouldn't order a large and im glad I didn't because the medium fit perfect"
"Interesting all the way through, am just starting to read books on my IPad, hope to find more like this one"
"We have a large dog (Collie).  Of several different products we tried, including the expensive stuff from the Vet,  this worked best by far on the ear mites."
"love it i like the way it makes my truck look i will so buy more stuff from them and i have told my friends about where i got it"
"i love it its better then the otter box ill tell everybetter i know that has a i phone to buy one its great"
"A great conversation started of much needed conversations between adolescents and adults. A definite must read and use for educators in the urban middle school."
"The material was not what I expected. The feel was quite cheap and less than what I would wear. I gave it to a friend."
"don't be fooled by the picture. It does not contain pomegranate. Does  contain pomegranate flavor. this is basically pomegranate flavored candy covered in chocolate. Don't be fooled by the picture."
"Goes into so much detail of every Zelda game made and has a lot of artwork. Couldn't have asked for a better Zelda book."
"I purchased this gift to my friend and she is very very happy. She uses it every day from the day she came home with the baby!!! I am going to buy another one for another friend;)!!"
"Good information.  This is a older book so it was a bit out of date, but all of the improtantion information is here and is very well done."
"the kettle is fine, simple, the only problem i found: if you boiled water, poured it &amp;#1097;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1077; and open the lid to add more, the steam can burn your hand - be careful."
"This is a great smoker.  Does what it is supposed to do..........smokes.  Please note it comes with a clip on the bellows to hold them closed during shipping.  That clip is metal without rounded edges.  Be careful when removing it.  I sliced my finger on it."
"A grain of salt must be taken with the no exercise part, however on the whole, a good and rewarding read."
"well written and thought out, enjoyed it very much. author doesn't talk down to reader, but explains details well.good job."
"noisemaker defective, only works when it decides to. frustrating for human if not the dog. wouldn't recommend this product for purchase."
"I bought this cage for my two chinchillas because i wanted to put them together and have them be in a bigger can they were currently in. But when i recieved the package the first time not only were many of the parts rusted but they were bent or broken so i had to return it for another one. When I recieved the second one, it was still damaged but I wasn't going to return it because I had waited long enough to recieve it. Most of the problems I had to fix on my own which cause assembly to take longer than nessecary.But once it was assembled, it looked great and my chinchilla Coco (the other one passed unfortunately before he got to experience the cage) loves the cage. Its spacious and gives her alot of exercise room that she doesn't even know what to do with it.If i could have I wish I could have requested a fragile sticker or something on it in order to ensure the product is tampered with."
"This case is as cute as it is durable. Your phone sits in a rubber casing that fits very snug. Your phone won't be falling out."
"Only good for paper, peels off everything else as soon as it dries. If you are looking to paint on anything other than very porous paper do not buy.This is definitely NOT the same as the stuff we had in school. Purchased to use for a temporary window mural, but it peeled as soon as it started drying. It will stick if you apply hairspray to the glass but is transparent and comes off the instant anything touches it and forget applying a second coat or painting anywhere near finished areas such as outlines or a different color as the dry parts will immediately peel off if you so much as look at them the wrong way.If your looking for REAL tempera paint for anything other than porous paper this ain't it. The real stuff has been known to stay put for centuries this stuff comes off darn near everything you put it on almost as soon as it dries.As for overall value with shipping it was almost $50 for the set, a trip to the nearby ""Walywurld"" and you can get the same paint for maybe $20."
"Good for cheapy brushes.They are what they are.A high end set of sables they ain't, but then you can't even buy one good sable for the price of the set.I wouldn't recommend these for oil and canvas, but they're good enough for water colors, acrylics and tempera/poster paint."
"I was excited about this...but when I got it, it was so tiny...I don't know what I thought it would be but it's tiny...It was delivered on time and packed great..."
"This is for my granddaughter...I am so happy with the purchase...It's well made...It was delivered on time...I have great things to say..."
"My granddaughter has been asking for boots like this so we ordered them...I was really impressed and the quality of materials..."
"When I opened the package it was really well made socks...I'm so excited for my granddaughter...I'm sure she will be thrilled..."
"Well it took over a d@mn month to get this case. And when I got it I found out why. It came from tiawan and is a cheap piece of metal with two stickers on it. It only fits king fits and I smoke 100s. All I can say is thanks for selling me an expensive paperweight Amazon. You guys rock!"
"Good sturdy cable. Functions great for my phone in my car. It is very well made and i will buy more cables from them."
"Bought this for myself and as gifts to give away. I kept the largest capacity one and after many cycles, it's still holding as much charge as before and works great!"
"I recently bought the tablet and keyboard they work great and compliment each other. Keys are just right size for my fat fingers. Going to buy my son one for christmas. Now I dont have to tug around my laptop! It not white, its silver but it goes good with the white."
"Awesome tablet!  Works great and carries all the needed programs that I use!  The keyborad has the USB port and I recenly found a mini USB flash drive at best buy. Or Amamzon sells the adapter which is real nice too. The 32 gig memory is good enough for me as well as &amp;#34;MY CLOUD &amp;#34; file storage supported by ASUS. The only drawback is the camera is really only good outdoors (no flash). Got my tablet overnight via Fed Ex."
"much quieter than a Hyundia that I purchased from amazon several years ago, a big mistake.reaches pressure quickly. I only use to blow out, so can't speak for how it works with tools"
"This book guides you through the six weeks, give you choices so you are not eating the same thing everyday."
"the Jolie Pleasures Plug is not that good of a product for a few reasons, first of all it is very soft and is very flexible which you may think is a good thing untill you try and leave it there without using the finger hold, i almost lost it inside myself on a few occasions that is why iv stopped using it, but if your looking for something that you dont just want to keep in place then i would recomend it just dont ever let go of the finger hold"
"Great product..loved it alotI ordered 5 pieces and all of them were great and the package was perfect :)"
"the beautiful dog looked amazing , it kept running ,was so happpy because of this costume they loved it alot"

"I loaned this book to a radio DJ friend from The Day. He loved it so much will use it for reference on his radio show. I will order another copy for myself. It is a fantastic overview of the history of rock and roll with many authors from the era."
"This Is the best game I have ever played. It is so fun. If you like games where you upgrade, then this is the game for you!"
"I chose 3 stars because it was hard to mount on the wall. It was crooked when I received it. But I made it work. Plus wish it came with the bottles that fit in because the ones I have are too small and topple over. I mean you can fit any spice bottles in it but the bottle are sold separately which I don't feel like paying $30 for spice bottles."
"I love Affliction clothing, and this Konflict shirt is sort of a knock off of Affliction. Still looks great , price was great so I bought it. The size though is bigger than I expected. I think its made for big muscle guys with tiny waists lol."
"Had problems pretty much from the start. Customer service was great helped me resolve the first issue froze up. Then it started acting up again a few weeks later and I just gave up on it. Nothing against the seller but this tablet is crap. It is slow even with added memory and now wont even boot up just says updating.....and never stops updating...no matter how many times you reset it."
"thank for all in the industry productI received the product and knee on the iPhonethank thank thank thank"
"I love these jeans!! They are a tad long but looks amazing around the waist and butt! When you walk in a room people cant help but to stare at these Jeans!"
"This cookbook has great illustrations.  I bought it to give as a Christmas gift.  I may have to buy another for myself."
"I have owned a copy for years and loved it.  So glad to find a copy to share with family."
"Kids and grand kids love the waffles made with this product. I like that they are made individually. Its convenient and delicious. You can add your own ingredients for different flavor. Cooking is non-stick which makes cleanup easy. Love this product."
"I love it when an author can bring you into their made up world and make you feel like a friend, confidant, or family. Having a special child of my own I could relate to the teacher and her madcap class. I've also spent time in similar classrooms and enjoyed the uniqueness of each and every child. Her story drew me into their world and had me laughing so hard my family thought I had lost my mind, so I shared the passage so they could laugh with me. Read this book if you enjoy a book with strong women, you won't regret it."
"It was a slow meandering book. Kept me interested to the end...mainly because I wanted to know where this woman would end up. The author still needs to answer the question of why one of the dolls arm is shorter!"
"I literally stayed up til 4:30 in the  morning reading this book. I got Bound by Blood yesterday. The lovely Mrs . Jackson has created a realistic storyline, that doesn't include sparkling vampires and I am hooked. My only real complaint  are the covers, if the man in book has long blond hair, then the cover should not have short dark hair!  Other than the cover this series is outstanding. Just what a person wants in a book ...... ..a bit of fantasy, comedy, romance, and mystery."
"I love kids books. This one is very fun, from the story to the illustrations. Get your own copy to enjoy for yourself and to share with your little one."
"This one definitely made it into my favorites list. While it is one of your typical boy meets girl, they fight, and then discover they are made for each other, it still has  so much more.  The author wove the story and characters together in such a way that kept me coming back to see what they'd do next. I really enjoyed Caitlyns interactions with the ghosts. Amazing find! I highly recommend this book."
"I have played a lot of mahjong games over the years, this one isn't the worst I have played. The graphics are nice and the fact that I can turn the music and noises off is a big bonus. But the game is glitch. In the middle of play it will stop n boot me. That doesn't endear this version enough to buy the full version. If that gets fixed it will be one to buy."
"I enjoyed reading the depot. If you enjoy reading books that end on a cliff hanger, like a soap opera, then you will enjoy this book also. I personally do not like soaps. They are a waste of time. When I get the time to sit down and read a book I don't want to be angry with the author at the end of it. I choose short stories because they allow me to enjoy a little down time  without wondering when I will get a chance to finish a book. Unlike other prequels I have read this one actually leaves you feeling like some one stole your brownie after the first bite. Before you read this make sure she has published THe Library first."
"I loved this book. After reading it I couldn't believe it was free. This book is very interactive. It gives you  a view from a telescope as well as a flashlight type effect so you can see in the dark surrounding main character. Also has a couple mini games. They  don't have to be played during the reading of the book but I can see that they appeal to kids. My 4 yr old granddaughter enjoyed this book.  As for myself I both enjoyed the story and the layout. Thank you for this great free book. I highly recommend."
"I got this book as a freebie, and I am glad I did. If you want a great, quick read, this book is for you. I didn't find it scary or suspenseful but I had to know what happened next. The author doesn't fill the book with unnecessary information to draw out the story, just gives you a great story. I hadn't heard of this author before and now I am wondering why. As soon as I finished this book I went looking for Sinister Entity and when I finish it I will definitely go looking for his other books. Thank you Hunter Shea!"
"I am looking forward to trying some of these recipes out. Unfortunately one of the best sounding recipes does not have ingredient list...the Bavarian mint...would love to try it. I didn't find many recipes I won't try in this book...except maybe the one recipe with no coffee added. I do recommend this book for anyone that likes coffee with a little spice. I will come back and update this review once I have tried a few"
"If you like to laugh, share this with your child. This is a good story, I will definitely look for more books by this author."
"I find it interesting that the investigator in this vampire game looks like Keanu Reeves. When he talks, with that British voice, it throws me a little. I wouldn't say fixing things in the boiler room are adventurous, but maybe that's why I don't get paid the big bucks. I'm not very far into the game but so far I have no idea where it's going. So far the games seem pointless. But try the game for yourself. It's not the worst game I've ever played but I'm not sure if it'll make it to my faves list either."
"My mom  and sister started teaching me to cook atAge 11. In turn I started teaching my son's when they were 11. I taught them the same way I learned, a little of this and that. Worked great til it was my youngest son's turn to learn. He can only cook be recipe. It was so frustrating for both of us I stuck to box meals. They are all adults now but I think this book will help him. Everyone should know how to cook for themselves. It not only saves money but when they sit down to eat a good meal they cooked, it gives them a sense of pride and accomplishment..my youngest is now learning and just like her brother's, I enjoy watching her face after the first bite. The smile she gives herself is amazing."
"I love bats. So in turn I have tried to teach my kids to love them. Most kids love to learn big words. At 2 to 3 yrs old they knew what echo location. I realize this book was meant as an overview but come on, telling someone that a bat sees with their ears and then not to tell them how they do it is just poor story telling."
"Wasn't sure about this game at first, but I really enjoyed playing. The quilt pictures you are uncovering are beautiful. I recommend this app or others by GabySoft,  I haven't found one yet that didn't entertain me while I wasted time. The one thing I'd like to see included, and my reason for only four stars, is to give this app some type of penalty. You can just stumble along pushing buttons and still uncover the picture. I would also like to see an option of timing the puzzles, or something so that there is some way of showing you improvement in the game. But I would like these to be optional so that a kid can stumble along and uncover the pictures without penalty like the game is set up now."
"I was amazed by a lot of the information I found in this book. I will actually reference this book in the future, which is not something I can say about a lot of books I have looked at over the years when looking for natural and preventative foods. I didn't give five stars because after only a couple pages I could tell the author is not a native English speaker. Some of the wording set the information of balance and I had to reread to try to figure out what author was trying to say. Not because of spelling errors either. I think Mrs Cooper did an amazing job. The book is full of great information, just please have the book proofread by an English speaking person. I would happily come back and update my review and give five stars."
"This back pack is your standard Jansport bag, but the quality is perfect. I can see myself using this for me entire college career. The straps are comfy, the bag itself is not too bulky or large but like a tardis, it's bigger on the inside than it appears."
"Great book to have.  Wonderful for the coffee table, for guests to flip through.  Interesting information and fun facts about each country."
"This is a great story and fast read.  There are surprises around every corner. James Patterson has done it again."
"The battery works great.  The moment I putted in the battery it worked great and it still works great ."
"where is my money i mail it back to you and its said that when you get it and you will put the  money back on my card"
"size was not stated in ad so I assumed they were the size from the eye doctor.  They were quite a bit smaller which limits what they can be used for."
"It's so much easier to carry than a hard cover book!  Love that I can read in bed without a light to disturb my husband's sleep."
"I think it has very valuable contents, very useful for medicine students who want to learn antimicrobials.I don't like the one page format, because if you want to study a table, you need to see the left column and the upper crow of the table. With the actual format you can't see both, because the tables are divided in two parts. Also you can't read it in a iphone, if you want to see it in the hospital, for example."
"It was very fast delivery ..my dog love it...thank you. I would order anytime again.looking fowards to look at more dog 49 ers"
"At first I got this for one reason, and that was because of I enjoyed Michael C. Hall in Dexter and I loved that. But sense I got the whole series of six feet under, I have totally enjoyed this also."
"We got this for our grandbaby so we could have a high chair here. Comes in very handy and easy to set up."
"We got this because my wife just discovered this show and she just loves it. Glad we have Amazon prime."
"I got this for my wife to replace her regular kindle. She has hardly put it down and has told me how much she loves it. It does everything so thank you Amazon for this product."
"I got one for my  daughter and then one for my wife and they both feel more secure with it."
"If you have iphone 5 do not purchase it is not compatible and does not work!!! Don't waste your money on this. IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!"
"This broke the first time my 6 year old granddaughter used it."
"An amazing game! It met all my expectations and it gave a very good origin to a gaming icon! Entertaining story, challenging. It is almost as good as Uncharted. Loved it!"
"I like the color and durable quality of the cover's fabric.  It's not fancy but serves a practical purpose to keep a household applicance clean and secure."
"quality tools"
"awesome hat"
"It cooks so great....non stick, heavy pans, great quality! I have used them several times and I love them. Great price!!"
"This cost me $1.29 and it works better that any charger I have ever bought.  This even has a safety release so It will not come undone during travel. Great price and works perfectly."
"Gorgeous as in the picture.  Fits well.  I have gotten many compliments.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting some bling!!"
"I bought this for a stocking stuffer.  I have one just like it that was bought earlier in the year and it is great.  This is a great price for a nice, good cover.  The color is a deep gorgeous color."
"I bought this game for my husband as a Christmas gift for two reasons: He loves (and I mean LOVES) Monopoly, and he loves Nintendo. Well, needless to say, he LOVED this game!! We ended up playing this game together almost immediately after he unwrapped it and it was great to see the classic Nintendo games represented on the board as well as the little character pieces."
"These sandals are VERY cute, don't get me wrong, I just didn't expect them to be so cheaply made. They definitely can't be used for every day walking, but if you just want them to look cute, they're great. They were alright for how much I paid for them though so I can't complain too much."
"SOA is the best show ever! My husband and I watch it for hours! We love it! Jax is the man!!"
"The fabric is very soft. Appears to be well made. For this low price you can not go wrong. I like that it is reversible."
"This book is beyond perfect and the ensuing is just so adorable I feel like if you read looking for Alaska and then read this book you wouldn't be able too contain your feels it's a great book I promise you worth reading."
"this i mounted under my cabnet. i read other peoples coments. I put the screws going down the cabnet from the inside then cut just a small amout off the screw so it would not touch the light. worked great. instead of the screw sticking up into the cabnit."
"Every pastor and every person should read this book. eye opening stuff."
"I used it and it worked great  cant see the screen during the day . got me to my destination no problem"
"my daughter loves this thing she bought a nintendo 3ds witch she has to leave pluged in to work it know she can walk around with it."
"Certain areas broke off and the two layer case was a bit awkward fitting together.  Real nice rubbery feel to it and good camo."
"Great little game. I had a lot of fun playing it. It's very hard to put down once you start. The physics are spot on."
"These seat covers were everything I wanted they match my car and it has a leopard print but I put them on and they don't fit my seat right and was told they would and I have to fix them all the time never stay down. insides are falling out and I have only had them for a couple of months"
"Received on time, actually really quickly. Planted a week later. A week later saw sprouting. A few days later rain. Most of it washed down because of an uneven yard, but grew great after the rain. Will buy again soon to fill in where it washed away.  Soft and green. Definite buy !!"
"Got this for my 18 month old daughter.  It's simple and cute. Effective counting with praise for completion. Definite 'gotta get it'  for young children. No pop-ups!"
"Starts off really cute. Soft and colorful. But after one washing... fades a lot. After two washings even more. The sheets are now see through. Don't get me wrong it hasn't fallen apart or ripped, but the lack of color fastness is enough to make me wish I had bought a different set, and I had bought two. So if you're getting it for a bed that your not going to wash, go ahead. But you might want a little better quality if you have to wash behind toddler boys."
"I probably didn't read as much as I should have. You know, the fine print. I checked the ratings to see if it was appropriate for my kids. To my surprise , all I got was a very slow going story, comic book style. Then an opportunity to buy the full version. Looks to have potential, however without trying it, didn't buy it."
"I have read the whole series from the beginning and I absolutely love it! The story line kept me interested from the first page! I would suggest reading this series from beginning to end, as I plan to!"
"This was a really cute book and the story line was good. i think girls will enjoy the book! i read it in one day."
"I have a 38 ft. 5th wheel and followed the instructions as to where I should put 2 of the stabilizers.  I put 1 additional stabilizer accross the back and one on the drivers side toward the back.  They work great and are quick and easy to set up.  They are compact and easy to store.  I will be recommending them to every one I see."
"Just took them out of the box  They look to be exact replacement to the originalwith built in levelers and adjustersBrice is awsome compared to OEM prices"
"More to come  This is a Christmas present as well as a house warming presentJust what the cook of the house wanted. . . . . .. ."
"I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to provide a safe &amp; secure housing for cats.  it is all the description said it was.  I put it on my front porch.  We had very heavy rain that night.  I checked the inside of the house and it was not wet.  I also bought a self warming pad for the inside ot the house which makes it very warm for the cats."
"I really love this product works perfect with my packge of nike Ipod and sensor 100%recommendable for people who don't get nike sho's."
"This is the best ever like I mentioned on another review I ordered 3 so far 2gueen&amp;1full..easy and quick assembly my 16 mth old granddaughter helped ,,does not make noise ,,very strong,, but then noticed after I started to order by third one the price had went up tremendously..high in demand now ..I was gonna order more as gifts for others not affordable now..All- in- all still 5*"
"I like the tight fit ,my first waist cincher you can definitely see results the first time wearing it,the second day it was a lil looser,,I just ordered another one aswell,both in a large,..prompt delivery had the first one for a week now today 3-30-14 is my third day wearing it ,, the other one is scheduled to arrive 4-1-14 since it's by the same person it should be 4* too,the reason it's not 5* is because of the itchy feeling and marks it leave on you,,I keep it on for atleast 12hrs. as I go about my day."
"I really LOVED this book. And there are several reasons:First, good reading. It s very interesting just to read this book - interesting to follow life and development of writer, to know about unique personal experience of Liu PingSecond, very educational. It shows China from completely different point of view. You see from inside all historical events took place in China thrue the eyes of real reagular people who lived them throe. We (westerners - as we are called in the book) don't have real picture of the country, its culture and people. And book of Liu Ping opens your eyes and make you think different. After this book I decided to read more about China - about it's history - so similar and at the same time so different from RussiaThird, very emotional. This book gives you so much positive enegry, fills you with optimism and desire to live your life and fight for your dreams. It motivates you to work hard and study more to improve your professional skills and make personal growth.So, I would stongly recommend this book to everyone who is interested in world history and looking for insperation. And for all who want to read about unique and motivating life story of success."
"Very good book. I love mythical mice relationship love stories.  These shifting stories are exciting. The author is very talented."
"Another new giant, Bouncer joins the tech element. He has finger pistols kinda like Trigger Happy. He can also fire off rockets from his shoulders. Later in the game, you,ll get an ""I-beam"" (basicly eye lasers). He is a good skylander for long range attacks and as well for button-masher people. He has a path about futher devoloping his rockets (which I choose) and one for his fingerguns and lasers. Overall , I think Activision needs to go back to the drawing table and make a change because you should expect more more from a giant than this ( please don't sue me Activision). Well there might be a reason why they did this.  Also see my Trigger Happy review for anyone who reads this or just likes to button mash a lot.Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants. :-)"
"This is one of the best  books I have read in a while. The characters come fully to life and the story of their struggles in the harsh mountain logging camps kept my interest from the beginning. I look forward to more from this author."
"I've used now for about 3 weeks and it is holding up well. Fits my AT&amp;T iPhone 4s very well."
"Love, love, love this show! Great writing, great actors, great dialog. Please keep it going.John Goodman is fantastic and the show is very entertaining."
"If you live the life of a digital nomad, like myself, you will find this monitor amazing. I use it with my MacBookPro Retina computer (thunderbolt to displayport) and it works wonderfully. I've owned HP monitors before and never been real impressed with them. This monitor is closer to the DreamColor technology HP sells and is very high quality. I only wish it were just a tad bit lighter as 9lbs is still quite a bit but is not outside the range of easily portable in your suitcase :-)"
"Recorded in 2010, you'll find a few familiar rants and toons from his popular web series on this comedy album, but notably this fills in the gaps for the storyline of Germaine's nervous breakdown. I'm glad that JIM keeps it fresh by including Pillz-e and Begley (as I began to miss the squirrel punk Brit ex-pat- think Sid Vicious), in his never-ending NYC cultural/social commentary. He's ballsy as ever telling it like it is whether it's Germaine's weight gain, the state of education, or people walking around zombified from a cocktail of trends and antidepressants. Don't be afraid to DL this if you want to mirthlessly grin... or do be afraid."
"This Boots are very confortable, they are  true to size and looks great on your feet. I purchased the black color and looks really nice!!!!"
"You wouldn't want to put it down. The story is captivating and gives a true picture of live has so many twists and turns."
"Yep would recommend to everyone!This book is one of those you will think to yourself....&amp;#34;Im soooo glad I purchased this-its awonderful Historical Fiction!&amp;#34; THANKYOU!"
"On time-great shape and our 2 year old Grandson will love it next year as an early Christmas gift!!Thank you very much!"
"Grampa will have fun watching this also with our Grandson! It was filmed in the city I grew up in...has some great memories! Was in condition as stated and  received on tie too!Thank you!"
"I hold Merrell to a high standard for comfort and quality.  I was not disappointed in these sandals.  Highly recommend them."
"great show, too bad there is only 2 seasons, wishing there were more to watch, now on to something else"
"I love betty and Val, great show, very funny show, the husband and I love to watch it in the morning"
"I always believed in Heaven, but I loved Dr. Neal's story of what it was like and I've had signs that I felt had to be imagined and knowing that she had the same doubts makes me realize that it is possible.  I think she explained things in a 'down to earth' (no pun intended) way that made it hard to put the book down.  It is a book that I highly recommend."
"I seriously love how it left my hair. I only bleached the tips (ombre style) and used this brand. Its a really rich, dark purple but will lighten up eventually. The only thing I hate about it is that it literally stains everything. I have to wash my bathtub with bleach to wipe it off. Other than that, its really awesome! I totally recommend it."
"Not only does this book give you insight into how hard and dedicated you need to be a SEAL, it also illustrates how selfless a person Adam was. It's made me realise how much more room there is for me to grow as a person."
"Wasn't expecting much due to the low reviews but it's a pretty decent movie and worth watching if you're a sci-fi junkie :)"
"The picture in the product description is misleading. The product features a camera, a flashlight and a small bag for the camera, not a pair of binoculars as shown in the product image. Be aware of this before ordering."
"I just downloaded this free app.  I love horses.  The app has great graphics and will guide you along the way.  You can purchase additional horses, tack, and even change locations. It's a great app and very addictive. LOL"
"exelent i very please  wh this product i looking foward to order again some way i order beford tx tx"
"Beautiful ring, still in great shape. Nice cheap valentines present that looks more stunning and eye catching than the actual cost."
"I had to completely take the trap apart myself and put the trigger rod in the correct position. The trap was impossible to set the way it came from the factory. Quality control personnel in china should be fired! It's a good thing I have my own tools and know how to use them, or else I'd be stuck with a useless piece of junk!I thought I was buying a quality American made product but was disappointed to find this Chinese made,useless until I fixed it,piece of junk!"
"The screen protector is easy to put on and stays on well.  I wish that it was easier to clean because it is hard to wipe off the oils from your fingers"
"I love this case!"
"this products was exactly what we were looking for. It is easy to use and easy to clean. it is very functional, weare very happy with it. we purchased this nfrom amazon. very good service.all of our other purchases were very satisfactory."
"Works great could be a little lighter. An all blaze option would be nice. Shipped very fast received prior to promise"
"This case totally lives up to the hype. It fits perfectly of course, and the display works great. There wasn't any interference with answering calls through the display.The only concern is that the back is left unprotected. I loved that the front display is protected if I accidentally drop the phone, but I am concerned about the back and corners. I love the features so I'm not going to switch it out. As a terrorist fix, I used a cheap eBay back protector on it until my flip mate case from spigen comes in. Until then I'm baby-ing my device.SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Case Flip [Flip Mate] [Crystal Clear] S-View Cover Protector / Samsung Flip Cover Back Protector for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500"
"This flashlight would be great if you could actually recharge it. But the plug sits recessed in a cavity at the back of the light and none of my extension cord will fit into the cavity. Very odd design. Wish I had paid closer attention before purchasing. It is now a paperweight."
"it work great just a pain if you have to take off for any reason fits like a glove thanks"
"this game rocks but do not change ur name after u have finished the game because it messes it up and u will have to start from the beginning! but I still think this game rocks."
"the headset works great the sound is nice i love the color and you can use it for listening to your laptop, phone, or ipod it works the same with all and the sound is nice."
"I really like this case it adds color and flavor. fits the phone nicely. Only down part is that it is hell to take off, so don't put it on unless you plan on leaving it on for a while."
"Dose Leatherman make anything i that is not of good quality. This sheath is very nice, you can feel the quality. I use it to hold my skeletool. It is just slightly to big for that tool."
"Beautiful necklace and Daughter loved it, but the chain broke the first day she put it on.  Now we have to find a chain."
"this thing is so wonderful it works great heavy duty and Im happy with it I will keep working with this items until I died"
"The box is a heavey duty and you can travel with this box for gigs if you wanted to I like it and it was cheaper then the other boxes"
"It's a fantastic product. It does everything it says it does, has a super easy to use interface, and adds new games regularly, (on average every 2-3 days). The only thing I'd like to see for this to earn 5 stars is PS1 game support and codes. Once that happens then this will be the perfect device to enhance a second playthrough or save you hours upon hours of annoying grinding."
"Ok...not as good as others ive read."
"el producto llego en perfecto estado, el tiempo de entrega fue lo pautado, la se&amp;ntilde;al y la cobertura son buenas en nuestro pa&amp;iacute;s.. as&amp;iacute; que se lo recomiendo"
"Its recommended to use this safety can to keep potential fires from starting in your home or your work place."
"I use it every day and it has worked well. Dropped my phone a couple of times and it did it's job well. I highly recommend it!"
"I gave it to here for Christmas and she was very happy. The necklace and earring were very nice.The price made me happy!"
"I purchase this lovely gown for my daughter. The price was great! I was so surprise how quickly it arrived. It fit perfectly! We are very pleased with this gown. It is so beautiful."
"I gave this book a three because it wasn't very long and it was 4 dollars .I think it should be a novel"
"a disappointing product, although it looks beautiful in the picture but my first impression when i received it that it bulky. i didn't pay much attention to that and tried to get used to its size but the disaster that within 8 months the watch stopped working and it appeared that its mechanical parts are not working properly. this is a first time for me to face this with any watch not to mention a branded one."
"very bright, well worth the money. i carry it everyday and once i get an actual holster for it it will be even better."
"The  white case is pretty, there are some pearl-luster pigment on it, and it fits the phone well!  It's a worthy purchase!"
"Just received my Wright Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case - Pack 2, and I must say it's a good idea, but the carrying case needs to be about a 1/8"" longer to hold my syringe, which is filled with 50 units of insulin.  In the information, listed in fine print it does state that the case will hold up to 49 units, but the most insulin I could get into my syringe, and be able to fit inside the case was 48 units of insulin, again it's a good idea, but the case should be about an 1/8"" longer to accommodate a full 50 unit syringe, again the information states that it fits my size syringe, and it does, but it will not accommodate the full length of my syringe when filled with insulin to it's full 50 units capacity, the case will only accommodate a syringe with up to 48 units of insulin.  I am thinking about drilling a small hole in the end of the carrying case, which then would allow me to fill my syringe to the full 50 units of insulin I need. I do recommend this Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case, but it does need to be about 1/8"" longer, so I can only give it a (3* Rating).Note: Update - I was using a BD 1/2 cc syringe which at full capacity holds 50 units of insulin, and it would not fit the case it was too long when full, so I upgraded to the next larger diameter syringe, a BD 1 cc capacity, and it holds my full 50 unites of insulin, and fit's the pen case without any problem. ""Syringe fit Problem Solved"" !"
"Everyone should have an item like this ""Emergency Fire Starter"" in their survival kit, it could mean the difference between living, or dying. In a survival situation it's the little things like this that can save your life, be prepaired !"
"For the money paid I guess this Cleaning kit is OK, but the wooden box it come with is not of high quality, (crooked rear mounted hinge, and smeared stain, or paint on the top lid, also the kit I received states 42 pieces, and not 35 pieces as the sellers ad stated, so I guess it depends on how they count the included items in this kit, again the gun cleaning kit is OK, but nothing special, not of high quality, but for the money I guess it's an OK kit."
"This Bowie Knife is made using quality materials, and is certainly worth the price the seller is asking, but I can only give it a 3 star rating because the craftsmanship is lacking in the final knife product, it's a shame because this could be a very fine knife, one which would give any purchaser pride in owing it, but again what it offers in quality materials it lacks in craftsmanship.  I would have been happy to pay more if the the quality of the craftsmanship was better, but at it's current price it's still a good buy."
"This ammo case is nice, well thought out, I'm adding it to my combat vest outfit, as they say &amp;#34;More Bullets&amp;#34;, really it's a nice rifle ammo case, both my 308 cal. and 30-30 Winchester Ammo fit nicely in it, and it will probably work for many other rifle caliber ammo too.  I give it (5* Rating).JM"
"I already have this cell phone, and just purchased this one for a back-up because the monthly insurance fee for my cell phone was just too much, and by buying this phone as a back-up it will save me lot's of money in the long run.  &amp;#34;I do recommend this cell phone&amp;#34; if you need a solid performer that says &amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; it gives you all the other bells &amp; whistles  too, but not the over priced price tag that you would pay at the cell phone service/provider company !JM"
"Hi,I ordered this cell phone case to replace the one I had, which was of the same brand name, I accidently dropped my smart phone, and it hit the asphalt paving in a parking lot, but I was so very pleasantly surprised that all that was damaged/broken was the heavy plastic belt clip on the cell phone case, and nothing else, &amp;#34;The Armor Heavy Rubber Case Saved My Cell Phone, Not A Scratch&amp;#34;,  so that is why I am recommending this rugged case, &amp;#34;It Really Does Protect Your Phone&amp;#34;.  I give it a (5* Rating) !JM"
"Cannot beat this for the price! I use this all the time on my UDS and it work perfect. I set the temperature and forget it. Highly recommended!"
"Great set of blanks at a great price! Colors are awesome in blanks. Will buy this set over and over again."
"It was not easy to read, it had a lot of scientific theory's and words that I was. Not familiar with and I think it would be better for people who have a background in science."
"This book has some great points, the only thing I don't like is when books have you read only a chapter a day, somehow on books like this I get distracted half way through. I will continue to read it. One great thing I do like is that is has a scripture for each chapter."
"John Waters midnight classic looks great on this dvd format. While I wait patiently for the Blu-ray (if they can even make one), I can enjoy some time with the filthiest people alive. The &amp;#34;Shock Value&amp;#34; of Pink Flamingos aside, the kitschy music, sets, and costumes are rolling on the floor funny. But be warned: If you are shocked easily, offended easily, or just down right closed minded, you should pass on this."
"Delivered on time, well packaged and slip case only slightly worn. '67 DVD Set 4 Volumes 7 &amp; 8. Vol 7: The 50,000 Breakfast, Dead Man's Treasure, You Have Just Been Murdered, Vol 8: The Positive-Negative Man, Murdersville, Mission Highly Improbable, Bonus episode: The Forget-Me-Not. Essential set for all Diana Rigg fans with the episode &amp;#34;The-forget-me-knot&amp;#34; where she leaves the series and Linda Thorsen as Tara King is introduced."
"Basically, nothing really great to point out, other than a heavy base so larger, heavier cans don't tip it. Other than that, a basic can opener that seems solid and durable (so far)."
"Great price for a big bottle of a classic masculine scent that is universally liked by most people. Being that the cologne is a spray makes it even more economical. It is rare to find a quality cologne like this in a store at the same price and quantity. I highly recommend getting this while price and availability last."
"Light weight and easy to hang, these sconces are a welcome change from plain old pictures. I actually hung mine on either side of a framed picture and it completed the wall. Only drawback is the undersized candles they include that don't lie flat and centered in the glass holders. I am actually searching for replacement candles and/or glasses for it. It would be nice maybe if it was stained glass. Still, it was a good deal for the price and I am satisfied."
"If you have ever owned a pen-lite like the ones we used to keep on our key chains, this is exactly what you get here. It may be a bit longer, but does not put out any more light than that. I purchased it to put over my laptop for a little additional keyboard illumination, and it was essentially useless. I hung it just a little over 12 inches above the keyboard and found that I might as well keep it off for all the good it does. Also, I had to scotch tape the light in its base otherwise it just falls out. This should be a novelty in a dollar store, nothing more. WAY over priced. I can not recommend this product at all. The fact that the batteries don't last very long either is a mute point since I don't bother to use it any more."
"This unit performed well. No problem leaving it plugged in so far, although I unplug it when I leave the house because of the reviews I read, and indeed it even states in the instructions to unplug when not in use. The toast setting is sensitive, so it may be difficult to get very lightly toasted bread if that is what you like. I like my breads actually TOASTED, so setting it at the lightest it comes out perfect for me. Cleaning crumbs is easy with the pull out tray. All in all, it is more utilitarian than a standard toaster, as it bakes and broils foods as well. Except for the auto off for toasting cycles, there is no timer or auto off for baking or broiling. I just set my microwave timer."
"There is nothing like a good &amp;#34;who done it&amp;#34; to while away a lazy afternoon. Of course there can be no comparison to one written by the estimable Agatha Christie and acted by the sublime David Suchet. Watching these mysteries in Blu-ray is icing for the little grey cells Mon Amie. Top that off with the beautiful art deco sets and period costumes, and all you want to do is kick back with a soothing cup of teasan and watch episode after episode. Highly recommended....enjoy !"
"Interface not so easy, and the load time is slow as molasses. Other than that, it works fine and the price was decent. Can't report on the 3D functionality since I don't have devices for that yet, but nice to know it has it when I am ready to go that route. Slim, light, looks good. Recommended."
"I have never had an issue with screen protectors before, but these are pretty crappy. The first day I had one on my phone, it had scratches all over it. Progressively they got worse and it got to looking really ugly. My second one was impossible to get bubbles out of. I was very disappointed in these and I would suggest you look with another seller"
"ust perfect and it feels nice."
"Not the size I was expecting, it is meant for a child not an adult, dimensions on the site would have been helpful!!"
"good"
"Although this is a very pretty little dress the quality is very poor!  After one ware the cheap fabric frayed, snagged and showed signs of distress.  I washed it on gentle cycle in a lingerie bag and dried on gentle cycle, and it fell apart.  Many parts of this outfit is glued and not sewn together.  As the glue melted in the drier it stuck to different parts of the dress leaving glue spots everywhere.  I would NOT recommend this product nor purchase from this company again."
"LOVE Them! Have not worn yet......too cold in MT. Right now........but perfect fit! Exactly what I thought I was getting ! I reviewed sizing per previous customers......therefore I ordered an XL......I am 5'5&amp;#34; and 154#. Hope that helps with your sizing choice !"
"Purchased for my daughter. She is 8 and wears a size 7......ordered medium .... I think is too small.......but she LOVES it! That's all that matters ! I recommend buying larger size. It's super soft and made well....would order again! next time just larger size. Fast shipping also !"
"I can't wait to go to the next book. So many questions have been answered and so many more have been raised."
"I have just discovered another favorite author. I just completed ""Beyond Justice"" and I`m anxious to start reading his next one on my list, ""Terminus""."
"It would have been nice to know it was a very short story. For the price of two dollars and ninety nine cents I could have bought a real book. Fifteen minutes of reading was not worth it."
"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBANDS PHONE AND HE LOVES IT!! THE ONLY THING IS WE THOUGHT YOU COULD CLIP IT TO YOUR SIDE,,THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY DOWN FALL BUT OTHER THAN THAT ITS GREAT!! THANK YOU"
"DID NOT BUY THIS ITEAM MY HUSBAND JUST WANTED ALL BLACK BUT OTHER ONE WAS GREAT. HE LOVES IT!!! GREAT BUY"

"This is a surprisingly well made and warm shoe.Never owned a pair of 574's til now,I'm sure I'll get another pair soon."
"The day after putting my phone inside this case i started having issues. The case causes the phone to overheat and causes permanent damage to the phone. My phone crashed once, I was not positive if it was the OtterBox so i put the phone back in the case after paying to have my phone fixed. My phone then crashed a second time. I returned to the cell phone repair center and they fixed it again. I did not put the phone back in the case this time and it has worked great ever since until about 20 minutes ago i placed my phone back in the case and within half an hour it has crashed a third time. The damage at this point i dont think is fixable and i will be forced to purchase a new phone soon. Never again will i purchase a product from OtterBox."
"this comforter isn't a good match for a toddler because it isn't very long. but it is soft and warm."
"Very cute but you can't put the lids on them AT ALL! Let alone with a drink inside of it. Unusable"
"Really nice mouse very customizable. You can change all the leds and change how bright and how often they flash or change colors. It just took a little while to get used to how cheap it felt but over all it's still a good mouse."
"It's not what I remember as a kid. It actually creeps me out more now, but it's not a bad movie."
"I loved Edwin's book True Haunting, so this wasn't much of a risk. The storie's were very clever. I enjoyed this book."

"I love it.  Very attractive and easy to set up.  WIsh it also worked on carpet, but as an engineer, I understand why"
"Bec Botefuhr is an amazing author. I've read almost all of her books and haven't been disappointed yet. Three hearts One Soul is sweet, sexy and at times heart wrenching.I highly recommend this book if you like to laugh, cry and swoon while reading."
"One of the BEST exercise DVD's I've ever used ... seeing results already - but it means I HAVE to do the workout. At 64 I also can choose how &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; to work and which ones I need to modify until I get sronger.  And because it's in 10 minute increments, I can choose to do 10, 20, 30 or more minutes and which exercises to do  ... thank YOU! Fantastic price and was in great condition ... now my turn!"
"This product will teach you how to use the chin na well. Yang Jwing-Ming is knowledgeable. I truly recommend this wonderful book. All you have to do is follow the instructions. So please get this book."
"Learn what Suzanne Brickman is teaching you in this book. If you truly want to learn Chinese, take this course!!"
"Perfect &amp; amazing!A great pleasure for all Sarah Brightman's fans!Congratulations, my CD arrived very fast and certainly that i'll buy again with you."
"I bought this item about a month ago because I was in desperate need of installing an easy access light switch going into my garage. So far this item works great and was fairly easy to install if your handy with a drill and screwdriver to mount the switch on a wall. For me this item is only intended to be temporarily until I can find an electrician to hardwire and install better lighting. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to easily install a wall switch for lights or other electronics. I would have given this 5 stars but I'm not sure of the battery or long term life of this product though."
"I originally bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my parents based on the most favorable reviews of any pillows I read. My parents totally loved them so I decided to purchase 2 more of them for myself. I have to admit that they these are not your typical idea of what you think a pillow would be. They are actually kind of heavy. After a few nights of getting used to them, I ended up really liking them. They are firm which I like in a pillow and they hold their shape really well. I find that I don't toss and turn nearly as much causing me to have a better nights sleep. In conclusion, I would recommend these pillows to anyone who is currently unhappy with their current pillows and willing to try something unconventional."
"This was simply amazing. Although I had some difficulty applying the skin, since it was my first one, the results turned out great. The back is harder to apply than the front, but following their instructions for using low heat with a hair dryer really helped. Shipping was quick, the reply from their Skinomi Awareness Program was received very promptly, and the extra free skin also arrived in only 2-3 days. Perhaps that is because I live near the company's offices, but I am extremely happy with both the product itself and the service. I've only had direct application skins before and those are always a pain to apply to any type of device, with all the mistakes and re-applications. Hopefully, this skin will last me a good amount of time! But one thing I have to say is that the skin seems thicker than most of the ones I've previously used; although that might be because of the wet application for this specific skin as opposed to the skins I used in the past. Overall, 5/5 and I will likely be a loyal customer. :)"
"This book opens your heart and mind to what is going on in the spirit as we live out our faith and worship. I have sensed these things and seen a few of them with me eyes closed in visions. To see them as they happen with eyes open, I will pursue. Hearing Blake share them, makes reality of the Kingdom come to earth."
"This book began a call on my life. I have been given an assignment from God to learn and use my art to help and heal. Marching orders. Starting a new path."
"I learned so very much from reading this book. I really did not understand all that speaking in tongues was about.I now have a way better understanding of the subject. I am putting into practice what I learned. Prune it all away Lord and fill me with agape love.."

"Jason Upton has a way of lifting you up, encouraging you, inspiring you. I love to worship to his music."
"I like it. I like that I can either write, or type and can use it off line as well as on."
"This game sucks. It's got a similar set up to Mario but the controls are awful. Half the time when u go to jump you'll just stop moving and fall straight down. Sometimes you can correct and other times you just die. Whoever likes this game obviously is delusional or hasn't actually played Mario or is making there review based on a very young child playing the game. I hate this game and my 6yr old won't even play it. It does work though but if your expectations are very high you won't like it at all"
"Cute, short, easy to remember.  My son is 7 and really liked it, but he did memorize it very fast."
"Super cute, now if I can just figure out how I want them on the wall I will be doing better."
"Gave my 2 year old the courage to feel free in the pool and me the comfort to let him do it!"

"I've started the pan, but have been interrupted by illness. I think it sounds like it can work, but I still see the need for cardio activity more actively in the beginning for myself. I plan to continue with the book and hope to utilize all her suggestions."

"Very satusfied with this product, it was a great price and very fast shippng. It fit perfectly, and description was very accurate."
"it is a good story but it seemed at times to be a little jumpy. Also, the proof reader should considere a career change."
"This is a top of the line bmx pedal at a great price. I would must recommend it to anyone."
"I love this case, it doesn't lift my screen protector like most cases have. It's cheap but really does it's job. Keep in mind it pops on and doesn't protect the front of the phone much, but it is exactly what I was looking for."
"Pretty cute. Very sexy and fit. I wear it in our party, fits my legs. I don't have single complain. Really its nice."
"I just ordered 3 of the sleeveless, they are so flattering on.  I will order more for my mom. She will love it."
"As you can tell just by looking at, this is not your average top. The design behind this top is inspiring, and it certainly looks great with a number of styles. I know this is one that I am going to wear for all occasions."
"Used a size 26mm on the straight handlebar from projekt and had no problems with installation. Brakes worked well. Great set of brakes for a great price."
"I bought these pants for work because of their taylored, sharp look.  I was pleasantly surprised about the really comfortable micro fabric.  Very nice pant."
"When i bought this i must have missed in the description that this product was a miniature version of the full book. I was not impressed. But thank you for the speedy service."

That person is Mark Nielsen a 34 year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department, in his book, M Son: Boy. Man. Marine.The book is an honest unpretentious portrait of a father who modesty yet effectively recounts his son's joining the United States Marine Corps, and heading off to war. From the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in San Diego California, to the long trip to Camp Dwyer in Afghanistan.Nielsen tells of his many long hours of praying with his church, family and friends.

"I really liked this product, it is easy installation and operation of its sound quality is very good and the image of the videos or movies is excellent, very good!!"
"The safty razor replaced the razor and strap.  It was an improvement over the razor.  Todays safty razors are an improvement over the original safty razor. I found I cut myself whenever I used it probably because I'm not use to useing it.  This butterfly razor is well made but the one side of the razor doesn't alow the blade to protrude (as needed) as much on one side as the other. I've gone back to using todays safty razor."
"It dose sharpen your blade and worth the money given the price of blades. Be aware that everything wares out you do need to replace it yearly."
"I was very disappointed when i got my journal. It clearly says The Twilight Journals (The Twilight Saga) to me that means you get the four books. I was hoping it would be that but it wasnt. I opened the package only to see it was just the one journal. If i would have known it wasnt all of them i wouldnt of ordered this. I had read the reviews nd all of them said they received 4 so I decided to order it but I only got one book .. I was very disappointed I wanted it to give has a gift ... Not happy with this product"

"this product was what it was described as, however, for the price plus the shipping price it should have been more in quantity. The option to buy in bulk should be available, all else was fine, the seller was great in responding my doubts and the product arrived in very short time."
"both codes weren't working also the game box was broken like somebody opened it many times and threw it away in the garbage, at least in arrived so soon"

"Just got this and tried it on! I love how long it is! Very pretty and sexy feeling. Feels like real hair and will look great with my costume ideas."
"This little purse is so cute in person but small. I use it for makeup/change. The otters are otterly-adorable and I carry it with me for quite store trips."
"Very pretty but took way to long to get here. It is a nice green color, sparkly etc. This piece is big but not too big. It looks great in a mess of curled hair."
"I love these, super cute! The heels is a little tight so I may need some cushion for back but besides that they are puurrfect!"
"Very cute and sexy corset. Size/fit and color are great. It did seem small but hey that's what a corset does...you loosen it then cinch it back up. Definitely great for a costume with the added flourishes. I am looking forward to playing with it.The added material at the bottom does not cover much so an additional garment will be necessary. :)"
"you get what is advertized. it works. its good, not much to say really. if you need one, buy it"

With the weather there this last week the new overalls have gotten a ton of use, my dad actually called to say how comfortable they were, how warm they kept him and how easy it is to move around in them, he wishes he had bought them a long time ago. Thanks for the perfect gift and a great product."
"I have been using skinomi screen protectors for years on my phones so I went with this one for my iphone 5.  It is easy to put on and by 1-2 days it is completely clear with no bubbles or dust underneath.  Just follow the instructions and it should turn out great like every one I have done in the past.  It is a little scary using the liquid solution but as long as you soak up the excess solution it seems to be fine.  I trusted it on my brand new iphone so that says something."
"The book was a good book.  l have always like Dolly and thought it would be interesting to read about her dreams.  The only thing I didn't like is the book read too quickly.  It was too short."
"I receive it early than I expect. The case looks cute and I like it. Generally, I am happy with this product."
"My kids and I loved this book! It's packed with lots of humor and a fun story line. We kept turning the pages, laughing much of the way. We want to buy the next few books in the series. Who doesn't want more joy and laughter in life?In addition to the humor, we appreciate how Beamer, Bash's cousin, grows from his cousin's influence; albeit he does protest the stretching like most of us do. One can't help feel sorry for the aunt's nervous tick developed I'm sure from this zany bunch.We highly recommend Bash and the Pirate Pig!Posted by Michelle and Patrick Welsh family"
"I encourage people to get a copy of Bird Face. Cynthia Toney realistically captures what it feels like to be in junior high, wrestling with discovering who you are and finding where you fit. Wendy has to work through some of her own problems and insecurities while addressing some tough issues that her classmates struggle through. I like how Wendy finds her courage to do what is right for herself and others and how she grows and is blessed by her decisions. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading more by Cynthia Toney.Posted by Michelle Welsh"
"I enjoyed the story very  much, but felt like it ended too soon. I think she could have written more since it is a short book. I'd love to read how the story continued after the blessings. How did each grow after the baby came?It is an encouraging story of hope and of reaching out beyond yourself.Mrs. Patrick Welsh"

"This tea tastes so much better than the gunpowder green tea I have been buying.  I am also a bit of a history buff and even though this may not be from Japan, it is of the type used for the Japanese Tea Ceremony which I perform among a few friends every once in a while.  And when I'm not using it for the ceremony, it comes in single serving pouches so I can just sit down and enjoy a nice cup of tea!  This makes excellent iced tea as well!  Highly recommend this Matcha Tea!"
"I can't prove that this product has made me lose weight (my husband got mad because I was doing better at losing weight than he was and destroyed our scale), but my clothing fits looser now.  And, this product has the added bonus of tasting fantastic!  It tastes to me like honey with just a tad bit of molasses!  Makes fantastic iced tea and ice cream and is an excellent replacement for most anything where your would use a sweet sauce.  I highly recommend this product!"

"They fit perfectly for me, the colors are great and the name on them is small so it is great since as a marketer I hate showing the brands I use but I always look for the quality of the product."
"I never expected to see a good movie, just one for sleeping, but definitely you always learn others points of view on every movie. I did like it."

"I have bought many pants of many brands, THIS particular pants have been more than I expected. I like them because they are light and ALSO they are of excellent quality."
"I really enjoyed the characters and story lines in these books! Can't wait for the next book to come out!"
"Beyond anything then I expected very fast for everything if cod user then this is a great PC for that even great for PC beginners like me I'm done with Xbox good by 60 dollar a year"
"Did not work.  Called camco and they told me there were some that were wired wrong.  They sent me an e-mail showing how to rewire it correctly.  I rewired it and it still wouldnt get hot, not even warm.  Gave up and bought a hot water on demand for $240 more."
"It is who it is about!  And who wrote it.  It is in the cluod and not in the Kindle, which is where I wanted it to be&amp;#62;"

"I love this book.  .....it keep me going the hole time....this book would be great as a movie I can't w ait for the next book"
"this was a text book for a university class so i needed it quickly and the book was in perfect condition and delivered extremely fast.one quality concern... a group of about 20-30 pages were not cut at the top properly so they were formed together almost as one thick page which i had to tear apart. i did not find it a big enough deal to complain or file anything as the seller was very exceptionalthank you!"
"This book was written by an author with a TON of experience on the subject. Lots of interesting tidbits of info on how air behaves as it passes through not only the engine, but through both the intake and exhaust systems. The book is a bit math heavy, so it's not written like a typical DIY engine book. It's more of a reference for those who are building engines on the professional level. If you skip most of the math (as I did), the book is pretty easy to read/understand."
"If you want hands free music and talk give this a go. Noise cancelled out on a bike forget it. i don't care the brand or the cost, at least thats been my experience. The cost of this was peanuts compared to most. So good for the most part, worth the price in any case."
"Really like this showerhead. It looks great, has good pressure and a nice water spread. I don't use the jet feature, but it works if needed."
"It's just a well thought out peace no more looking for the crib board let alone the cards and those pesky pegs its just all there"
"I ordered this item for my car. It sticks on the car window perfectly! It adds personality to my car and I don't think most people know what it represents either so all the better!"
"These tapers are a good deal and a good quality. I ordered three sizes at a time and they sent me one of the wrong size, so I had to return all three and re-order. It was an inconvenience, but they corrected it with no problem."
"John Birmingham is an excellent spinner of tales. He writes large on a canvas that is larger than life and oh so very believable."
"I love Ellen's Show and I think she's one of the funniest women around. So I was looking forward to read her book... and got very disappointed. This book was just another way for her to make more money. It's funny at the beginning but it's getting old after the first few pages. She just takes random subjects and writes 2 or 3 pages about it; the chapters have no connection at all. You can tell that she just tried to ""fill"" as many pages possible. For example her chapter about Meditation: 4 blank pages!!! I wouldn't mind that much if her book had been 4$ or less... but paying the prize for a ""real"" book (where every page is written on) is just too much! DISAPPOINTING"
"Mabel and  Jack have moved from the comforts of home and family in 1920's Pennsylvania  to take up homesteading in Alaska.  Having given birth to a stillborn child  ten years earlier,  Mabel,  still childless, finds the noisy chatter of children and adult talk of parenthood at family gatherings  painful reminders of her own loss.  Lured by the hopes of a fresh start in the quiet solitude of the Alaskan wilderness, neither she nor Jack are prepared for the harsh realities of trying to survive and make a living there.Late on the eve of the first snowfall,  Mabel  ventures outside.  Jack follows her, and they build  a snow child in the image of a little girl.  They adorn her with scarf and mittens and go back inside. The next morning, Jack is puzzled when he sees the  fleeting figure of a young girl dart through the trees. He is even more perplexed when he notices that the snow child has crumbled and the scarf and mittens are gone.  And it is at this moment that the enchantment begins.In eloquent and vivid detail,  Eowyn Ivey seamlessly weaves together the physical and the ethereal in her updated version of an old Russian fairy tale. Graphic descriptions of the wilds of Alaska magically  transport the reader there, while the story's characters, including the spritely snow child Faina, seem to be as real as  one's next-door neighbors.  Ivey  delivers the story in such a way that the implausible seems plausible, that reality and fantasy are one,  and that anything is possible if you believe in it. If you're looking for a story that  will capture your imagination and touch your heart, don't miss this book!"
"Megan Chance delivers a mesmerizing story through her fascinating and often enigmatic characters. The reader becomes completely involved in their lives as they struggle against an unforgiving environment and each other to discover shocking secrets from their pasts. Compelling reading."
"Tri Peaks is one of my favorite card games. Having a dozen  game choices is awesome, although some of them are close to impossible to beat. But it's fun trying!"
"At the start, this game appears to be not much of a challenge. But having played other similar games that start out with easy solutions, I expect that it will become more challenging at the higher stages. What keeps the game enjoyable is the panel of choices the player has for how he might need to use the tools he collects. An unexpected and creative spin on the usual escape the room games."
"I really love it ,its my grandaughter favorite color and she loved it, it fits perfect on her. and the price is good for these 2 pieces."
"I appreciated the mystery but I equally appreciated the normal, respectful relationship between a man  and woman.Thank you, JoHannah!"
"Great discounted items. Well worth the money.  Covers and accessory items are helpful and usefull.  Also told this by orher Apple product users."
"I cant praise this book enough! Perfect for anyone with religous concerns.I plan on ordering many more for our church."
"After using over 10 cases for my iPod, iPhone 4, and now the iPhone 5, I can say this is one of the best on the market. It's a huge improvement over the last generation of Candyshells, as it's slightly thinner, and doesn't have the droopy bottom problem on the iPod touch version. It's extremely solid, and the soft rubber part is much less rubbery than previously, and easier to slip in and out of a pocket. The port openings are fairly large, especially compared to other cases. I've heard of problems with the rubber disintegrating, but mine seems good so far - I will update if anything changes. Yes the back is very susceptible to scratching, but any shiny, glossy case will scratch, and that's what the case is there for!"
"This app is fun I am mostly rating it that way it will give me better developed pictures cause it's hard to tell what some of them are"
"I absolutely did not want to put this book down, and I was disappointed when it was over. The author has a way of bringing out each personality and remaining consistent throughout the book. I could actually see the landscapes and picture in my mind where each place was when described. I never thought I would want to go to Alaska, but now I do!"
"This book was so very inspiring. It helps remove the feeling of being alone and the guilt asdociated with loss. Bad things not only happen to good people, but good people do not have to necessarily give up when bad things hit."
"This is very good quality for a costume. I love how bright and durable the fabric is. My only complaint is that the measurements--as said in previous comments--are geared more toward men or women with longer torsos. I have longer legs and a short torso, and I'll likely need to either have it adjusted or tie it around my waist in a Portal 2 style rather than wearing it normally. It fits perfectly otherwise, or else I would return it and size down. All in all a very good product, but it's a risk if you're not sure on what size you might need."
"A little bigger than expected (that's what she said). Bolted these soft compound tires on pro line bead lock rims and they are great. Had to raise the body a bit. Good on road, awesome in dirt and grass. Serious slash bashing and the tires are holding up well."
"The sizing was perfect for my dress - about mid-thigh, and color matched flawlessly. I ordered it to go with the Leg Avenue Classic Cinderella costume, and it really made the costume. Very comfortable, as well as cute!"
"This is my all time favorite perfume! The only one I have worn for over 15 years. So to find it at such a good price is awesome! Thank you! :)"
"This is an awesome perfume! It came quickly and was exactly what I ordered! Thank you for the great price as well! :)"
"I found this in the grocery and purchased them for my husband and it helped, A LOT!!! :) Unfortunately he lost it! So when I found them here I was THRILLED! This is a product I highly recommend! ;)"
"We were very pleased at how quickly this item arrived and the quality and price! My husband is a die-hard Cowboys fan and he LOVED this gift from our son! Thanks so much!"
"I love this show. I watch it all the time whenever I want. i can't wait until Sean proposes. this is my first season watching the show."
"It broke already."

"This game. is very fun and blows clash of clans out of the water. long live castle clash and hopefully u will get it too Cu's its funAssassin67"
"not only was this book an easy read, but it really makes you think about your faith! I recommend this book to anyone young or old, believer or non believer because it is going to force you to look at your current belief system and reevaluate things with faith in mind. Good bless the Burpo family for sharing their story!"
"This item was received very quickly. The text looks brand new, has no marks, or bends on the pages or anything. The text itself is a great book, it has several different articles of educational research to help pre-service and in service teachers analyze."
"Sunshine takes you on a personal journey to Jamaica where she encounters many situations that are never spoken about.  Sunshine visits the beautiful country looking for love and is encountered by the many underlying issues and scams. This book was a great read, sexy, exhilarating and very informative."
"So far in the first few weeks of use no sign of breaking down. Seems durable and is extremely comfortable even for hiking."
"These items got the job done. A couple of months after being used. They are starting to breakdown. I think they should last a little longer."
"I had a hard time installing this item. ended up returning it. I am not giving it a 1 star because I never really ended up using it. But I did have a hard time installing it."
"I ordered this item for my kids. It looked amazong. Kids loved the item. We had a theme and it went very well."
"Item worked for about 2 weeks. cheap quality item. I am giving it a 3 star because while it worked, it was a nice item. too bad it didn't last too long."
"As a teacher, I am constantly looking for books that highlight the struggles our forefathers had in forging this great nation. There are plenty of books that do that job extremely well. &amp;#34;Dear America: The Winter of Red Snow&amp;#34; is an excellent historical fiction book that contains some great details of the hardships of Valley Forge. Rush Limbaugh's book, however, is not a good example.I have no personal bias toward Mr. Limbaugh. Like most pundits, he seems to be spot on at times and wildly irrational at others. There's no denying he's an exceptionally gifted orator, but that doesn't mean he'll smoothly transition into a historical fiction writer. But even if you have never heard of Mr. Limbaugh you wouldn't be able to read this book without wondering if he had a background in politics. Rush's own political views appear frequently throughout the book. This is fine if you are aligned with his views, but if you are trying to teach history from the standpoint of those that actually lived it, then this book will definitely be misleading. It's also a bit inaccurate at times on the roles of key leaders.It also doesn't help the credibility of his book that the image on the cover is the same image used to sell Rush's tea products. (An image that's a bit narcissistic at best). If this is designed to teach, as Limbaugh repeatedly claims, then it shouldn't be an advertisement.If you love Rush, then I ask that you approach the book with caution and understand what it is, a slightly biased, slightly egotistical, slightly stereotypical (at least against the Natives), and slightly inaccurate retelling of the events of the arrival of the Pilgrims. Just as you wouldn't want your hair dresser installing your catheter or your dentist landing a 747, perhaps Rush should stick at the job his excels at and not venture into a world best left to true children's historical writers."
"Had it about 2 weeks before it burned out. It might be cheaper than others, but this ends up being a case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;"
"Definitely would recommend! Gives the reader a look into another world and will have you flipping through it to see what happens next!"
"Ordered these shorts in one size but, they did not have them in stock when they were filling my order...which happens sometimes, so they sent me an email, they were honest about the facts, offered me 3 or 4 different alternatives, we had some extremely prompt back and forth email dialog about the shorts in a different size and my order was filled. Honesty and Integrity in today's business world...What a breath of fresh air!! AND the best part Mike, the owner, is an Infantry Veteran who has taken his discipline and values from the military and brought them to this business he is supporting is family with...Just so everyone is clear...I DO NOT know Mike but, ELITE HERO is now in my book in more ways than one!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!"
"I used this as one of my study guides and I passed the certification exam. The examples are really helpful."
"When I first bought my house in 2007. I hated the two colored gray and blue tiles in the bathroom due to plumbing repair prior to me buying the house not to mention the folding shower door. Yes apparently they made folding shower doors almost 60 years ago. So, I took down the shower door but I did not rip out the old tiles as they were in good shape. They don't make stuff like they used to and a bathroom renovation was not in my budget. I can only examine the cost of demolition of an old bathroom. My brother put this on the tiles which were about four feet or more up the walls of the entire bathroom and higher around the tub. It looks like a new bathroom.  The only difficult part was getting a smooth finish and coverage. He used a small roller at first that didn't give a smooth finish, but I had to buy another and there person at the home improvement store suggested covers that produce a smooth finish. I probably will order another kit, because as it dries you will see areas that don't have enough coverage and the touch kit is too small to cover those areas. Beware of the odor. It is very strong even after application for days. I had this done when my five year old was staying with Granny for winter break."
"The mat is really cute but it is very then. I did not send it to preschool with my son because it is so thin. It is about as thick as a quilt and I think my mom makes her's very thick. I was expecting the actual mat inside with a cover. I just use it on his bed. It is not worth the price."
"I've used this product before and had excellent results. However, it does not kill the adult fleas the bite and if there's an infestion, you'll have to use several applications and other products to finally get rid of all the fleas."
"I've used the product before with excellent results. This time it is taking longer than normal. Maybe I don't have enough roaches and am not putting enough out. It worked wonderfully when I used it at my father's apartment before he passed away. He was so sick that he couldn't clean his apartment and the roaches were out of control. When I came into town the first weekend and used the product, It killed about 75% of the roaches. Of course we cleaned the apartment which also helped. The next weekend about 90% of the roaches were gone. My mom loves the product and my second mom love the product. (I have to get it for everyone)."
"I am normally happy with Swiss Miss hot chocolate when it comes in the normal packets. However, the Keurig seems to water down the hot chocolate or they do not put enough mix in the cup. I would suggest brewing it on the smaller cup setting to get stronger hot chocolate."
"The shoes arrived with the toe smudged a little missing the color, but I was happy to find some cute boots in a wide width in my size. Although they are supposed to be wide with shoes, they're cut the same as a regular shoe. The reason wny the shoes were narrow is because I was shipped a 12B US when I ordered a 12W. I normally go up a size in boots, so that was fine for me. I only wish they had more cushion in the shoe. I would have actually liked to have gotten what I ordered, but I still like the shoes. They have poor shock absorption, and would be better if they came as a platform. So the shoe is comfortable after wearing them all day, but your feet hurt because it's like you walking around all day on concrete even if the office has carpeting and you're wearing thick socks."
"Wonderful, thoughtful, and inspiring. A book you will not want to put down, and you will want to read more"
"Good read. First a bit slow to get into, but the last half is an enjoy and interesting, twisting and turning read."
"i was so excited for this item to come in. it looks great and the protection it gives while still being able to fit in my pocket is awesome, but it never goes on right. it will randomly lock or unlock my phone, and it ALWAYS messes up my volume. during calls, while in doctors offices, i just do not get it. my defender series before this never had issues, except for the fact that it started falling apart within 3 months."
"I purchased this product for my daughter, the ipad case is great.  Great quality leather, fits the ipad 3 very well.  Great price for the quality of the ipad case this is the third case I have purchased and by far the best one I have.  I will be purchasing more ipad cases for xmas gifts, and getting the ipad mini case for myself.  A product well worth it."
"This tablet cannot handle heavy games regardless of GB. I'm returning it. Fake copy of nexus 7. Cheap alternatives of tablets are never good."
"I am never disappointed with Reiker shoes.  They are best for people with severe feet issues. I am using an orthodic with this shoe but it provides some comfort even without my orthodic so that is generally the test for my money.  It is very comfortable and as the company boasts it has the Anti-stress abilities that other so-called comfortable shoes don't possess.I also love the classy styling.  It's hard to find attractive shoes when you have foot and walking problems.Thank you Rieker!"
"This Jambu sandal is a good option for those who need support or have difficulty with backless sandals. The base cups your heel so no slipage and the straps keep you from pronating also.The toe box is a little cramped if you need to add orhtodics.  Without orthodicts it is sufficient."
"I would recommend this product to anyone. I got this for my wife and she loves it and has since ordered more."
"Enjoyed watching Jennifer and Rutger in their youth. Like the wardrobe, timeplace and scenery. Will not recomend for people under 17 yrs of age. Violent for its time."
"Is silly comedy, most unlikely to happen, like the cast, Katherine did a great job!!! will recomend to adults only."
"It is very entertaining, good action, silly fiction, love the costumes, the cast is wonderfull!!! Will recomend to ages 12 and up!"
"Do not know what they where going for, but was not artistic! Ugly costumes, poor dialog. Do not waste your time, and forget Matt Dallas (Kyle XY), here is not that young man some actually liked. His performance tanked! Not for people under 17yrs. Not a family movie."
"Maca root is very good I love it. It works good for me In many ways and my husband could also take it too with me ."
"An absolute must to save gas and add horsepower. You will feel the added power the minute you take off with this filter. It is that good. Fits exactly like the original and takes just a few minutes to install. No more power robbing paper filters that are over priced and they end up in a landfill in 10,000 miles."
"Excelente ! memantuvo interesada hasta el final"
"We have 7 cats, and have tried the auto feeders, which work and then don't, so we decided to try these great looking gravity feeders, and they are fantastic. We have 3 on our counter with 2 water feeders, and they look great and work great too! I highly recommend these for your pets."
"Daria is just the icon of sardonic irony . Her ethically uncompromising ethos , wry wit and glorification of the intellectual is still novel as amusing today as it was when I was in high school.  Only a philistine wouldn't like this show."
"Mozart in the Jungle hits all the right notes and plays me like a fool. Simply cannot wait for the second act .The only thing more beautiful than the music is the acting. BRAVO"
"bough this cord along with kurio cord and they both are crappy. they wont keep a connection. have to keep jigling cord and even thn it wont charge fully."
"good description and on time.would recommend this item and buyer to others. now i'm just filling space to satisfy the word req."
"I haven't tried this for wine stains yet but it works the best on coffee and tea stains.  Even if you use cream in your coffee or tea, Carbona stain devils always get out the stain!"
"I had this on VHS but wanted the DVD.  It works  quickly/  You will get toned up and gain flexibility fast."
"I use this with an anodized plate for cleaning silver and am so happy to find Calgon here!  I'll try it for water softener next."
"Very thin and not as long as the photos :( After waiting over a month to receive this week I was very disappointed with the quality and length. I will never wear this wig :("
"Durable and cute!"
"Good quality and I received the wig fairly quick after purchasing"
"I ordered this for Christmas for my wife because she's wanted a shoe rack for quite a while now. When she opened it, she found that there were multiple large pressure fractures in the frame which would eventually lead to a very broken shoe rack. I arranged for Amazon to replace the item, which they did promptly. However, when the replacement arrived, I was quite upset to find that the same pressure fractures were present (and were actually worse than the first time).I do not recommend this as a purchase for someone that intends to give it away as a gift or for someone that has an immediate need. So far I've sent one back and am waiting for Amazon to pick up the second and replace it again. I'm sure I'll receive one that's worth keeping eventually, but so much for a Christmas gift for the wife...If I receive a third version that is cracked, damaged, or unusable, I will simply request a refund. I'm not going to continue wasting my time if there is no quality standard on this item.Stay away from this one."
"i didnt really expect it to be like this rubber comes out easily, but it works great! for the price you pay.."
"I bought this cologne for $13 at 3.4oz. Let me tell you, a great buy on my part. I get so many compliments from girls who I don't even know. Makes me wish I would have bought this cologne sooner!"
"Ok, It's a great knife... except my tip was a bit bent when i received it. Also, I hate how it's so uneasily flipped into/out of position. Could have been designed better, but for under $10 it's a good knife."
"Bought it for my mom for her birthday, she loved it! Defiantly recommend it to anyone who wants to give their special someone a nice little suprise!"
"If you liked the Halo series you're probably gonna like this one too. Personally, I didn't like the changes to the multiplayer. It's something new, which is good to have... but I think they should go back to the old Halo play style for future releases, because we all know Halo 4 isn't the last Halo. Microsoft wouldn't let that happen."
"I own Ipath cats, trenchtowns, and grasshopers. I love them all! Ipath makes the most comfortable shoes you'll ever wear whether you skate or not!"
"It's been anywhere from 1.5 to 2.5 weeks now since I planted five. Two of them have sprouted, one of which already has two leaves."
"I would give 5 stars.. Simply bcos the book was like a new one and in good condition. I like what I seen"
"I believe this is a pretty good crochet book.I have not tried any of the items to crochet but it looks fine."
"I bought the micro loop extensions and trust me when I say this is the ONLY brush you can use on them! If you try to use a regular brush, the first time you try it, it will snag and either rip it out or feel like its pulling it out!! This brush lets you brush right through the extensions without cause damage and it does not hurt. Buying this brush will be the best thing you spend money on when buy extensions. This is a must have!!"
"I love this bag it is really cute, i dont really like the orange inside but i knew that is how it came and that is my personal opinion. I gave it 4 stars because i wish it came with more pockets. It has no pockets on the outside and the ones on the inside are really tiny. I ended up using this bag as my new diaper bag lol!"
"I was disappointed when we bought this. My husband bought it for me for Christmas and he bought it with my kindle fire hd so I could. Buy my Amazon Prime account and but when  we tried to it charged our account and we found out you can't use a gift card for that. When you order a gift card it says you can use it with any purchase."
"I love this case. It is great and works well with protecting my kindle. It doesn't look cheap and the leather feels great in your hands. Now it won't let you close it and charge it and it sucks to read with it on because it's awkward but you figure out what works good for you."
"uNu sent me a FREE case for review and believe me, I could not be any happier! I am glad I had the opportunity to participate in the UTry program.The uNu Dx protective case provides full convenience, allowing for an extra full charge of your iPhone, at the same time providing the durability and quality that protects the iPhone 5. The case itself comes in three different colors: white, black, and red. The finishing on the case is a nice a matte, that allows for a smooth and firm grip. It is form-fitted for the iPhone 5 and has cut-outs of all of the ports for easy access.The case provides a 2300 mAh battery, allowing for an extra 100-110% charge. One of the key features of this case is that while charging your phone, it charges the case at the same time. The case also enables syncing, alleviating the problem of taking off the case every time you need to sync onto itunes.In the box, it comes with the case, screen protector, and adaptable headphone jack. The adaptable headphone jack is required for even the use of apple earphones because of how deep the case protrudes from the headphone jack. After using the case for 3 days, I am VERY impressed on the quality of the product. I fulled used all of the battery on my iPhone, and the case still managed to charge it back to 100%. The case does add bulk, but I think this only makes the phone easier to hold. I would fully recommend this case to anyone wanting a quality battery case, that also protects the phone. The only problem that I came across when using the case was that their was NO protrusion from the iPhone screen and the case, so if you face the screen on a table, it would touch the surface. Overall, the case is built great and is a recommended buy!Pros:charges an extra 100-110%durable/protectivevariety of colorscase charges and sync without removal.Great matte finishCons:No protrusion of case to screenAdaptable headphone jack required"
"this game  has  very nice graphics this game is the best spider-man game in the world  I think  you should buy it."
"This app sucks. First of all, you have to use your winnings (if you can actually win) to purchase the clothing for the &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; to wear and ultimately &amp;#34;take off&amp;#34;, provided you can beat her (the AI gets tougher when the girl is dressed)."
"This is one of the dictionaries that is compatible with Office Suite Pro 6. It also happenes to be the most comprehensive of the offerings, with over 160,000 entries. If you get OSP6, then this is the perfect dictionary to have(you'll probably never see those annoying little red lines while typing again)."
"This case is almost all assembled and was easy to assemble! I would advise that anyone who has a compound bow and wants a light weight case for a reasonable price gets this one!!"
"I love the product but it came in 3 separate bottles (equalling the 24 oz). Was looking for the pump top, but it ended up working out fine"
"It warms of the room real well, I would reccomend it. The only bad thing about it is that the fan speed one and two are the same it doesn't change but it is not really needed."
"this little thing is amazing, connect easily, load voice and can work as a charger. u cant go wrong with the price."
"Couldn't put it down, I will definitely be reading her other books! I have recommended this book to all of my friends."
"So my old wedding ring was sterling silver and i haven't had it but a yr and a half but you would think i had it 30 yrs. So i decided to order this ring because its supposed to be highly durable. I ordered Fri Feb 21 and i got today Mon Feb 24 so not only is it here early but its true to size and its gorgeous i am in love. Im anxious to see if it holds quality after i shower clean etc. I will be getting back for an update. But my ring is just stunning. And a great price i will never buy sterling silver again!"
"Dropped it a few times but still hasn't broken. Solid and sturdy."
"I have been taking this for a month now and slowly I am noticing a drop in my weight. I plan to start a work out regiment too and will update after that to see if this accelerates weight loss even more."
"I didn't think I would like the system and then I realized it was created just for me.  From start to finish I learned the steps and began to lose inches just by utilizing the introduction.  Frankly, I didn't think I could move at their pace but I hang in there with a fresh bottle of water and towels cause you will work up a good sweat!"
"It's a good book but it scares you more than it helps you."
"It's a book everyone should read especially when at crossroads and you need direction."
"The game will last you about 4 hours from start to finish;the story never really made since and the customization on cars was crap. If you want to good racing game get Test Drive Unlimited 2, although not perfect I loved every minute of it."
"Made by weak materials (hook made by plastic), not resilient at all.My stong advice is to not use that thing to hold a laptop case."
"Very well designed cards, I've only used them a few times since I bought them on impulse(that's just the way I am) and I have to say it was worth the money(:"
"I read that some people had problems with the headset when they first got it and so far I haven't had any, definitely better than my old turtle beach. I really like the way the cord is made, feels rugged and it has good length.(:"
"I ordered it thinking it would be blue...but I suppose I just didn't read the whole description and it's black/dark-purple. So, that is really my only problem, and that is pretty much my fault...but if you guys either do have it in blue or get it in blue...cause I just like blue and black together...I'd like to order a new case from ya then. It holds up really well. It's a nice strong sturdy case and the price is pretty awesome too."
"It was a captivating book in my opinion and it was my type of love story, and as it was expected everything ended alright."
"This is one of my husbands favorite holiday movies.Great chemistry between the couple and a good family movie to watch some evening."
"I wanted to try these and compare to the Kind bar.While the flavor is ok they are not as satisfying or a big.I would not buy these again."
"Got it yesterday and I am returning. Much too heavy and super hard to open and close. Need a much lighter step stool."
"I bought the black one too. This buy was excellent.  Nothing  about it is cheap.Designer purses like this can run in the hundreds of dollars. This was an excellent buy."
"Making every experience count, learning patience, accessing our incredible strengths and finding the humor in the daunting tasks of life are few of the lessons I am learning from Being My Mom's Mom. TRULY it is a guide book for those who find themselves on this journey of elder family care. There are books and seminars and classes and brochures, but NONE more human and heart-warming than Being My Mom's Mom. This is life and HOW we deal with our paths truly determines our destination.Loretta sits down with us, makes us cry, self-examine and laugh. Like the warmth of the most awesome cup of tea, she chronicles how she has chosen this path of dealing with Dementia all the while challenging us to see life's rolelrcoaster through a different lens and re-value the seemingly mundane.Read it once to cry and laugh, once to help remember the lessons in pain and once to highlight all of the wonderful gems of wisdom she shares. Expect to learn about and embrace....change."
"This cookbook is definitely a five star purchase, the recipes are super easy, using affordable and easy to find ingredients and the outcome is amazing tasting food.  I use this cookbook every other day and the Caramel Slice recipe is to die for, you will not regret purchasing Hungry Tums cook book."
"Absolutely loved this. Dropped phone and didn't break . Yay!  Loved the prop on back. I have a two year old grandson who I let watch netflex on phone... so tough cover till he rung the prong off. :) he is a strong little fellor."
"Love the protection with this. Having to get use to opening phone to text. GREAT that you can anwser phone and look at time when closed. Could be a little more economical.  Almost ordered wrong one cause video played for one with no cover so not sure whats up with that. Why show a video of one cover on link that is not the same cover?"
"Fit perfect on my HK, it was just right, not to tight or to loose. It only took a couple days to get it."
"Couldn't be happier. It meets my expectations and then some. It looks and sounds great. I like that it has 3 HDMI ports. I watch movies and play video games on it just fine. It's obviously not going to blow you away, but you would've spent several hundreds more if you wanted it to."
"Sencha is some of the best green tea you will find. Gives a nice meditative buzz with a subtle but distinct flavor."
"This organizer is useful and practical. I can keep save myself things my keys, money, card, etc and my baby's thinks like bottle, pacifier,"
"The shoes fit perfectly!I love Privo! and have had troubles finding them in the stores near me.  I was so excited to find a pair that I liked."
"Although it wasn't what I had thought I ordered but it went beyond my expectations. I love the fact that it is a sensory type of book."
"Fabric was the exact print of what I was looking for. Although the description says it was cotton, it was more like a lcanvas n a rough material, so that was a little misleading. It was sufficient for the project I needed it for but had I been makin something else wouldn't have work since it was more like a canvas than cotton"
"I am very happy with my purchase , delivered on time , despite of other reviewer I got the new one, not the used one, the mixie is definitely yes for the indian kitchen , I used many other blender, grinder which we get in USA but not useful for making chutni , batter etc, I will say dont waste money for other blender/magic bullet kindda stuff if u hold the indian kitchen , this is the best."
"This brush is for dolls. Did not know it was small. Would not have bought them if I knew they were this small."
"This book helped very little. Not everybody would like to build just Egyptian stuff. Why not try making a book with mixed amounts of every type of building that is free."
"We Love these pads These are twice as big and absorbent. These seem to be sturdy enough to hold the moisture, without making a mess under the pad."
"I love the book , just like the others ,I read them in a day...the was so good...can't wait for the next one to come out"
"I didn't get to use it, because was broken when it got to me.....I guest it was to cheap ..."
"Me and my 2 year old LOVE this book and mitts, I bought 2 one for us and I gave one to a friend for her baby shower! because every parent needs this (: this book creates the most beautiful sound throughout our home... laughter! uncontrollable deep belly laughter that takes his breath away! we read this book everyday sometimes more then once! he will bring it to me and ask me to be the tickle monster! and no matter what I am doing I stop and put on the gloves! (: probably our favorite book!"
"they fit well my son loved them and they did not rub any blisters on him! will buy more when summer come around again and he needs a bigger size"
"a little cheep and have had to put the binoculars back together a few times, flashlight isnt great but we just use it for pretending games, shadow puppets, and reading books in the dark so it works for us.. everything is basically ok, not good or great just kinda it will do.. it is def more for pretending and playing not so much for actual use of them"
"they are wonderful my son was so excited! he LOVES Thomas. but they are pretty cheaply made. already coming apart at the seam when we opened them.. and the material seems like it will rip easy.. but they get my little one excited and ready for bed time so that's a big plus, but probably wont last very long. (however we have lots of Thomas clothes ((winter hats, gloves, and blankets)) and they all seem like they are cheaply made and come apart at the seems within days..) so I wasn't expecting much better quality, just sew it back myself and it stays together.. so that's why I still give it 4 starts cause I purchased only because Thomas was on them. they look better in person then in the picture and the blue one is nice and fuzzy and warm, the green one is thin so better for warmer nights."
"Pretty nice. And it came faster than what I thought. I love the color and is practical.  Perfect fit for my tablet"
"I found way bigger and cheaper dog pillows at Walmart!!!! &amp;#128545; not happy with my purchase at all! Half price of what I payed.."
"Not as fun and exciting as the first ones, the last two were more mundane.As much as I was looking forward to reading this book, I will think twice about getting another Stephanie Plum novel."
"I love these shoes. They feel great and look great. I get complements from everyone that sees them and they want to know what kind they are."
"The message is iiinspiring. This talk is a good pick me up. Uchtdorf really reaches out to women in here."
"I love the Ibera products. They're cheap and are made with awesome quality. This bottle cage is the newest addition to my bike and it holds the bottles well and looks cool. The cage is super light too, which is much better than the old aluminum cages I had."
"These things are pretty good if you need a replacement cap. They do the job. Not sure how durable they are, but it's pretty hard to break lens caps anyways."
"I alsolutly love these! They are perfect for cross fit and running! And the size was right on the money too."
"This kit is pretty simple but its just what i needed for the price i needed. It also ships FPO so that was good!"
"its very cute and has worked well so far. Im working in Afghanistan right now, so this comes is in handy!"
"I would recommend this book.It is well written, so positive and helps you to re connect to your true self.Thanks Marnie"
"I'm not too pleased because this item comes with clips to keep wires in place they were easily detached and lost and can't find replacements in white"
"I really like the quality of this product and the stylus met my needs as well this is also high quality ."
"Unfortunately I have to have someone keep changing the settings for me.  For someone who is computer illiterate i wouldn't suggest it."
"Is the driving realistic, no. Is the physics realistic, no. But it's a ton of fun trying to get the utterly undrivable vehicles over the steep bumps. And of course upgrade your favourite cars and chase the targets in various different surfaces."
"i kept reading and waiting for something to happen. Then it was just a fluff. Also the release date changes peeeeeeed me off. Was way too long between books."
"this game doesn't make any sense and I thought it was going to be like wipeout or some thing once again this game sucks"
"I got this shirt for my dad as a joke but now he wears it all the time! He loves it! It looks exactly like it does in the picture and fit just right. Good and funny buy."
"These shoes are the best, no joke. Not only are they super cute (i get tons of compliments on them) but they are really comfy! I wear them all the time!"
"buy this for a dlc and it was lovely it was everything i wanted and it made the game so much better, and it was nice that i only had to spend ten"
"Very fun and realistic very very good game love itit looks real and has cool features very nice controls"
"My daughter was looking for a spoon rest and I found this one on Amazon that matched her corelle dishes.  She was delighted!"
"I got a replacement for a new battery which would not last long for 2 hours. They gave me another one which lasts for 4 hours. It's not worth the cost!"
"I liked how straight forward it was as well as how accurate the information is. I strongly recommend this for business or for personal relationships"
"Makes my skin feel great. Perfect for summer as it is not too heavy and keeps my skin super moisturized without any greasiness. I have combination/oily skin so this is no easy feat."
"I don't love the chocolate one as much but the peanut butter is so good! Great way to cut calories in a smoothie"
"I love it. I love every song he records. I have played it many,many times and will continue to do so."
"I've seen Riverdance in person and on TV and ordered this video to show to residents at Atria Sandy, a senior living community in Sandy, UT on St. Patrick's day, March 17.  I know they'll love it as much as I do!"
"I love this game so much, it's so addicting. It's way better than clash of clans. But I've been having a problem with searching guilds. I created a guild and I play on a kindle fire HDX, and my friend plays on an iPhone, but when my friend tries to search my guild it does not show up. It says still searching guild may not exist. That was the whole point in playing this game so that I could play with my friend. Please Fix this. I want to continue to play but this is making it difficult. Maybe it's because amazon doesn't get frequent updates like iPhone and Android do. But I'd really appreciate it if this could be fixed. Ill give it a five star if this gets fixed."
"I enjoyed seeing Tim's motivation was indeed based on love.  Previously he came across more as selfish and just wanting Ben for his own sake.  Maturity allowed him to appreciate Ben's relationship with Jace so much better, since he had a similar one with Eric."
"Loved the entire book.  Terrible and terrific things happened to werewolves and their friends in New Mexico.  The inclusion of Native Americans culture adds another dimension."
"This is an amazing book, and probably one that more truly reflects the life of gay men, than most books written previously."
"I'm hoping this is the first in a series!  There is just enough angst to make the characters interesting and the love scenes leave you wanting more!"
"This is a sweet short story about a boy looking for love and another boy unsure it even exists.  Enjoy."
"This is a beautifully written piece set during a time in America so many lost everything.  Whit was able to pull himself together by helping so many others 'down on their luck.'"
"You might like this.  No character development.  No plot.  Just an orgy among strangers.  Definitely not any romance to sigh over."
"How many times do our dreams have a hint of reality to them?  This could very well be a portent of things to come!"
"The story plot was good and the characters believable.  Their relationship could have been fleshed out more if the story were longer."
"I'm not sure why!  It started out as a new book with a great plot but the sex scenes were almost word by word the same."
"This is a wonderful introduction to a variety of authors... All of them wonderful in their own ways.  New lovers, established couples and locations all over the world.  Enjoy!"
"it was boring, that's all.More words are required, so it was boring because each response was completely independent of the last, and most had nothing to do with what I said."
"There are a lot of songs in this book for eleven bucks. I could not be happier with this purchase!"
"Unfortunately was a waste of money, because I have it in the closet, am unable to use it, , and trying to return it was a headache due to the weight of the box plus the 15% restocking fee from the seller I would get back just half of what I paid"
"When it got to my door I wasn't completely sure but yep, it most defiantly was a piece of metal"
"The installation had an error and it will not run even to uninstall. Total loss of productivity and money. Autodesk's &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; is non-existant. Issues are handled via canned FAQs on website, e-mail chat groups which are impotent, or they want hundreds of dollar to talk to someone. I would recommend buying from a Chinese pirate before dealing with Autodesk."
"The product description says HP genuine displayport to vga adapter but the the adapter I received says Foxconn on the back and is made on China. It does not look like the product advertised in the picture. And the worst thing: does not work with my HP Envy X2 laptop. The conector is to big or wide to fit on the displayport socket. Sold by Compeve. I want to return this."
"Very good quality and arrived in perfect conditions!!! The product is very functional and stylish!!! The pocket in the front is great for storing pendrives and small things."
"The product is neat and small. But it does not work with my HP Envy X2 screen because it doesn't have enough sensitivity. Besides that is a good product. The little jack plug works well."
"Reads all my media files and organizes it form me. Very stable and reliable. Good looking. So so remote control."
"The upper part of the shoe was too loose so that my foot was slipping and sliding as I walked. Not a good fit at all."
"Thanks for the book and the awesome prize. I enjoying  reading. I recommend to buy e-books you didn't need Kindle to read a book at home. Thanks Amazon&amp;#128521;"
"I like my purchase because it matches a shirt I wear while playing golf and it is the correct size for me"
"This is a great product , I bought it for for my mom. She makes pizza's alot and this will help her in the process."
"The best smelling candle I've ever bought. I will be buying more of these candles. They have got my business from now on."
"This was a great purchase... I bought these for a trip to the bahamas and I can't wait to go with this luggage"
"I bought this to put on my home network.  I have several computers with a variety of operating systems.  OS X, Linux, and Windows all work well with it.  If I had to do it again, I would."
"Very easy to install and can get 7-9 hours of use out of a full charge.  I would buy it again."
"The seller is in China, so it took 3 weeks to get to me.  They had it packaged in extreme bubble-wrap.  There was no way the screen was going to get damaged in shipping.  The price was a little more than I had hoped for but it was much cheaper than purchasing a new ipod.  Changing the screen was quite easy.  Took me less than 3 minutes to do.  There are youtube videos that should exactly how to do it."
"This costume worked better than expected.  The hat had to be &amp;#34;de-wrinkled&amp;#34; before use, but everything else was top notch.  Order this a few weeks before use.  when it arrives, expand the hat and fill it with a towel or something.  Let it set that way till the event.  Everything is made out of polyester but it is sewn pretty well.  I was able to use it, wash it, pack it away for use another time.  Everyone loved the costume and I was a great conversation starter."
"I have a Nexus 5. I can lay it on here at almost any angle and it starts to charge.  The only thing I do not like is the blue LED that blinks to tell you it is charging is bright and very easy to see.  Kind of gets annoying at night, on the dresser, next to the bed, when you are trying to sleep.  A piece of black tape with a pin whole fixed it."
"I have a Nexus 5 and a Bose Sound Dock Series II. I plug it in, attach the USB and the audio plug to the phone, and it works.  Now I can charge my phone while I listen using the Bose.  I was afraid when I replaced my old iPhone that I would no longer be able to use it.  Thanks to the dockBoss5, I can.  The only thing is I have not tested it with my vehicle and will update once I do.  Also, it is kinda a pain to have wires sticking out of the top and bottom of the phone but without replacing the Bose, this is the BEST option."
"Thin, easy to hold, nice texture.  I still cannot believe there is a built in stand.  I use a stand very seldom but when I do, I no longer need to look around for it."
"Dr. Morris combines his extensive knowledge of creation, where he is the father of modern creationism, together with his extensive years of Bible study and training to provide a unique resource for those approaching creation from a Biblical perspective.  I recommend this book highly for what it is designed to do - to show what the Bible says about various topics related to creation, and especially the debate with the evolutionary worldview."
"This short book outlines the life of Herbert Grings, missionary to both Africa and South America.  Grings was definitely a bit eccentric, but effective.  What is most impressive is the number of missionaries who have come from his family, now in the fourth generation.  Matthew Champlin, who helped rewrite the book, is himself a 4th generation missionary from Grings.Robert. D. Patton, M.D., D.d."
"The acting was OK, and the filming.  However, I was very disappointed that they alter a number of Biblical stories in details.  I had hoped to use this in one of my missions classes at the college level, but the alterations prevent that.  Sadly, by altering several items, they lose the true impact the Bible gives.  Man seems always to be trying to better the Bible, and it cannot be done."
"The big difference in this book is the emphasis not only on loving the wife, but on respecting the husband.  Both are to be unconditional.  A mission agency pretty much requires their missionaries to read this book prior to going overseas.  After reading it, I concur."
"This book is a very positive addition to those on the life of Brainerd.  I found the original diary very difficult to finish.  It seemed like page after page of fasting, prayer, and sickness.  However, this book helps me greatly to put things into a chronological sequence and make the entries much more meaningful.  I would recommend it.Robert D. Patton"
"When certain scenes were changed to make them more dramatic, such as the end of the story, it is very disappointing.  The idea of forgiveness is absolutely key, and should be really as it is."
"I was frustrated by my GPS falling off the window at most inconvenient times.  Plus we need to hide it to make it less attractive to thieves.  This works great - sits nicely, is easy to move, and is stable without shifting."
"I really enjoyed watching again the movie which was related to the life of Gladys Aylward.  It is in inspiring tale well told with beautiful photography, tastefully done by great actors."
"Good movie showing the &amp;#34;passion&amp;#34; or ending side of christ only showing basically his trial and crucifixion. But it does show in actuality how they would beat someone and persecute back in those days."
"Trying it on face but still has perfume added to it so it's a no go for me. It didn't do anything but make face sticky."
"Good ole nozzle with plastic covering over the handle, has brass fittings in the end and guts. I think and hope it lasts a long time. It does have a warranty for life."
"Bought this to put in my air compressor and some flat tire repair tools, everything fits good and this bag is built tough for the job!"
"Accurate little thermometer, have not tried it out in the freezer yet but no doubt it will work there as well."
"Has little jaws that come in and grab jar lid once tightened down, then the leverage of the handle gives you grip to take lids off. Not sure how this will help elderly as they need both a stationary base and something to take top off but this works good."
"Does what it says, good on the hair not too harsh and not too harsh of a smell also which is a plus to me who has allergies."
"Perfect for properly disposing of lancents. Plastic container like you see in hospitals or doctors office, the lid it comes with hanging off is when you get ready to seal it up when it's full."
"For the price and non-stick properties these are great to use. Probably will get some good long use out of these."
"Overall for the price given its a nice little set of everything you need for personal manicure or pedicure. Good little travel kit"
"It's a good halogen bulb that gives a bright white appearance almost matching HID. I've used these for years over the yellowish phillips bulbs that come default. These fit the fogs on a 2012 hyundai sonata with no issues."
"Used on Glock and is ok but not padded inside and is kinda tough to get pistol in and out of even with laser light accessory on bottom. Good once you get used to it i guess but still for quick draws i prefer Mikes nylon or leather type."
"It suds up good, i used this in an attached sprayer bottle on my hose and it foamed up good spraying it out. Noticed after rinsing it immediately started beading water off which is a good sign. Only time will tell on how long it will last. As far as cleaning power it does fairly good, but i've seen better. Then again it is trying to do two jobs in one. The best cleaning of a car is in steps, but for an all in one cleaner and wax i think this outperforms most."
"It did not bother my allergies at all! It works like a strong gel hold, but the only thing i found fault was i have dark hair and at the end of the day it dried into flakes if touched and made my hair look like dandruff. It holds as a gel but needs R&amp;D on flaking apart."
"This does come with the pins included, they work the best for me when hanging pictures and can take and move later. I hate those stick on 3M crap as they usually fall off the wall."
"Bought for my dad to wear out and about, he really likes the khaki color as it blends with anything."
"Use this in the kitchen on the wall to write on, is very nice calendar to see and large enough space to write stuff on."
"These have good adhesive on the back and work well on any application from a car to a computer. The chrome coating has lasted many car washes so far, and if ever it wears out later then it is easily removed."
"Its ok, could have a little louder ring as my hard hearing mother could not quite hear the ring well. Although the clarity of the phone is really good. I love how when someone calls it tells you who is calling. overall worth the price from Amazon."
"I get so many smiles, thumbs ups, and thank you's for having this. So many people out there who know the truth about our government and how this great country is being ran into the ground &amp;#34;with or without our current president&amp;#34;."
"Heavy duty pan, heavy in weight and seems well coated and scratch resistance. So far it was worth the money."
"Nice shirt and fits well. Good thick quality cotton and overall colors and design are nice. Threads are done good too."
"It is hard to find these anymore around the hardware stores, with the metal backing and descent cardboard surroundings. Nowadays more people are buying the restrictive pollen catching filters that end up doing more damage than good."
"Great size for making fondue etc. I used for melting chocolate for dipping peanut butter balls and found setting on low side about 3 to 4 dots up worked best. Use oil in bottom when melting chocolate morsels so not to scorch or etc. Stainless cleans up very good, i was sad to see it was not dishwasher safe and recommended hand washing but that was no big deal. Came with the 4 dipping spears with different colors on the end."
"Good god paul anderson, i am a long fan of resident evil and your lovely wife Milla but this film kinda sucked. It did take alot from the game some but some of the action scenes were cheesy, and i could tell some makeup on zombies was poor. The story line seems all messed up as well and was confusing from the start, milla falls in water wakes up in umbrella.....fights and kills the main guy from last movie but yet at ends fights on his side and now given the t-virus again?? I can see that this is leading up to going back to the hive to fight the &amp;#34;changed appearance&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;red queen&amp;#34;. Why could you not leave some things as they are. kudos on milla still pulling off her hotness but in the last film please paul get help!"
"It goes on easy enough and holds up easy enough, but the drawback i found was it holds grease and finger prints easily and does not wipe clean easily. Causes rainbow effect once dirty or greasy also."
"Doesn't bother my allergies and smells good. Cleans hair fairly well and holds up all day, although you can tell its natural and not chemically fortified so you get what you get with natural shampoos."
"Going to be  christmas gift, for the price i expected cheap plastic or something. But its a good metal with pretty little design that reflects light all over it. Going to make a good little gift"
"Very cool design usb data cable that lights up blue while charging and moves at faster rate if battery of phone is dead and needs it, slowing down once battery is full then cutting itself off. Only down side is that i wish it came in a longer cord style so i could plug into wall outlet and run up my wall to dresser docking station! Overall i like it."
"I love CONTIGO products, over the years i've owned three. One stainless for coffee, one water bottle, and now this one. I like the locking mechanism on this and never leaks. The double wall is nice but will still sweat on hot days with a cold drink. I wish they had put insulation or styrofoam substance in between. Contigo makes good stuff"
"It's a nice little stuffed bear but the picture looks slightly darker brown that what actually the bear is. Also the frame is not wood but vinyl. I noticed some loose bear hair at first picking it up and running my hands through. Overall still a good gift for the price"
"The wipes themselves are tough enough to do the job but don't tug too hard out of the container or else they will tear apart &amp;#34;what makes them flushable indeed&amp;#34;. The container is really nice but is kind of awkward in that the wipes come from the side instead of the top. The lid that comes down has a rubber ring to keep moisture in &amp;#34;it promotes&amp;#34; but yet the lid doesn't snap very well down. As far as on your bum, the paper is soft and ample size. I can see this paper type being way more flushable than some others out there."
"good rechargable 9v batteries, lasts a good long time before needing recharged again. Use them in metal detectors, magnetic levitation devices and other household items."
"It's ok i guess it seems to work more than Kaspersky at controlling your pc and life. I don't like how long it takes customer service to get back with you and some features on it doesn't make sense and other parts are lacking. More intrusive than kaspersky but again i think the Romanian side is more advanced than the russian side of AV."
"This amp shipped quickly and it sounds better than any amp I've previously owned. It doesn't get hot when it's running either. I am completely satisfied with my new amp."
"This book is really a good way to review the English language and grammar usage.  I purchased it for a client who was from another country."
"I ordered this for a client from another country who needed to work on the English language usage and skills."
"This product met all my expectations. It works very well.  I would recommend it to any scrapbooker.  I love it."
"I had previously overlooked this cartridge.  It has many decorative images that will enhance my scrapbooks.  I plan to use it a lot."
"WE LOVE THIS MONITOR.  THE ONLY THING I WILL SUGGEST IS THAT YOU MEASURE THE SPOT YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IT.  IT BARELY FIT ON OUR DESK BECAUSE OF THE SIDE SHELVES."
"These shoes make good work shoes or walking shoes.  They are very light weight and so easy to keep clean."
"i LOVE THIS FOOD COVER.  IKT SEALS IN MOISTURE, DOESN'S STICK TOGETHER OR WAD UP.  I HAVE ALREADY ORDERED SIMILAR PRODUCTS IN A DIFFERENT PATTERN AND SIZE."
"Very light weight shoes.  Comfortable walking shoes and east to care for too.  The elastic shoestrings make them easy off/easy on."
"I really liked this product, just sprayed it over my vinyl seats on my boat, 5 minutes later i rinse them with water and the mildew stins were removed without brushing just apply and rinse!"
"it fitted perfectly on my psvita i recommend this product to any psvita owner, it doesn't attracts dust so you won't feel dust while playing, I can't really say anything of the lcd screen  protector because i didn't use it so I don't know what's its quality."
"Don't download this app! It doesn't let me create a new account or log into my old account. Kik keeps saying that there's an error. Well I'll tell you what the error is! It's that this app was put on the market, but was never tested! &amp;gt;:("
"Great product, shipped on time, can't go wrong with these."
"Excellent quality, love the features and fits perfectly, no need to cut anything just plug and play,  this is definatly worth the investment cuz it gets rid of those turn signals giving u a much much better look"
"This is the best Kristen Hannah book out there....well right up there with Night Road and Mystic Lake and Fly Away.  This was my first and I guess the first one always stays in your mind.  Fly Away was probably one of the best as it takes place in modern day but Winter Garden flashes back to the war.  I bought it to be able to read it again and again."
"This sprayer arrived without a bottom plug but the problem was promptly resolved by a phone call to the manufacturer."
"This is crap!  Slip proof is not exactly the truth.  Maybe if ya stand on it your feet wont slip but nothing else is stationary on it.  The cats couldnt keep theit footing.  Price is an add on item so not worth sending it back.  Good yard sale item"
"This item is huge.  Discreet is not an option with this item  Decided to send it back and find something that is advertised as small."
"Bought this for my husbands Christmas gift of a 45.  Pistol fits well inside and I expect my 380 would work in it too.  Definately a good case for the money."
"these run true to size and wash well.  Very comfortable to sit and lounge in.  Warm enough to wear on the coldest days."
"This shirt is very skimpy across the shoulders.  I ended up giving it away to someone who is about a size 8"
"It was not for me, but i think that my girlfriend like it, and we didn't have to go walmart."
"It was a gift for my uncle, but according to him it is great, the DOA 600 works awesome when aiming."
"A great movie. Im satisfied by all. The delivery was fast and all in great condition. Advice all who needs a laugh to watch this movie."
"I loved it. Already own and watched part 1 and was looking forward to part 2 and it didn't disappoint me. All great. Delivered in great condition and fast. All that like to laugh id advise looking to this movie."
"ok I bought this dvd since it sounded real interesting. A woman raising wolf children. Of first I didn't know what I should think of it since I thought how can a women get wolf children. I was concerned that it would turn out to be a bad animal abusive movie since you hear of so many things of today and people get so many ideas of getting money these days. Well I made a choice to check it out for all of you. In fact after I watched it I had tears in my eyes for the story was not bad at all. It was so much feeling so much love so much well lets say its fantastic. I don't cry easy but this just brought me in different character rolls which I cant explain since I would ruin the movie for all of you. I just can say it was a sweet treat. I always enjoyed watching anime since 20 years and im 26 now and I think if we had more people that would let there children watch anime we would have less crime in our world more then letting them watch the children programs of today. Plus they would learn better things. Don't get me wrong, its great that we have these series but they changed over time, there more over being fun and not of showing our children what love and all the other real important feelings are about these days. But I think you should buy it and check out for yourselfs."
"came in time, came in great condition, great movie, I would advise this movie to other people too, since it has a great story and I would say is for everyone from age 10+."
"they were a little bigger and bulky then I expected, a little to much for my ears.I would like my account refunded on this Item, thank you.  maria Altamirano"
"One of my all time favorite movies! Local Hero is a masterpiece - great acting, great plot, gorgeous scenery in Scotland."
"this item was too small than my expectations did not like at all. i needed something much much more bigge"
"Thought it was a great read, kept me interested the whole way though it, didn't expect the way it ended"
"very nice shoe and looks so pretty, I didn't buy it , but it looks nice, lol, funny face , happy face"
"I was expecting a bit more weight to these sheets but the color was great.Over all for the price not bad.! I would buy them again."
"The book was new, not used at all. The price was excellent. I will recommend it to any student. I have rented before from other websites and paid so much and at the end you need to return the book. For an excellent price the book is not only new but you can keep it as it has very interesting topics for Teachers."
"The cover is very nice and smooth in the hand. It prevents the phone from turning off whenever the phone is placed in hard surfaces. I dropped the phone once, and nothing happened to the phone. The price was good too."
"This is a great game but prepare to die a lot.  Definitely worth the low price, as you can play it over and over again."
"This is an excellent read.  It starts out fast and is fast-moving all the way through.  I couldn't put it down."
"I like how the brush massages and deep cleans at the same time.  My face feels so smooth even around my nose area."
"This is a most informative book.  It details how to prepare the fruits and vegetables. It explains how the body uses the produce.  There are so many recipes, you won't  make the same one twice in a month, unless you want to.  Very well done."
"Best buy I've made through Amazon. The item arrived sooner then expected . It's very easy to assemble and install and the appearance has plain yet elegant style to it. And the price was outstanding."
"My order arrived within the same week which was a big plus. I was alittle hasty keeping my fingers cross hoping I didnt get jipped.  The life of the ink seems to be lasting its expected time. Being that I'm using the cartridge for my work. Only problem is the quality of the ink is not very good. Its not as black as a brothers or hp cartridge its more of a faded to charcoal gray color, for me and my customer's its no biggie though. You can't beat the price."
"I don't typically read political fiction, but after reading Joseph Halsted's ""Last Voyage First"", I was enthralled by the author's style. This book is certainly a page-turner... I couldn't put it down! I recommend this book to all readers... very thought-provoking."
"this was the first item i received and wore it the same day. soooo comfortable on warm summer days!"
"these aren't as soft as i expected. will probably soften in wash. doesn't have a normal hem like the ones i purchased in a store."
"very comfortable. was afraid the waistband would be tight but it isn't. not heavy weight."
"the colors aren't the same as in the picture and they aren't as long."
"This product was received sooner than expected and was exactly as described when I purchased it. I will probably be purchasing another one soon for my boyfriend."
"I bought these for my son who has some medical problems. He has facial palsy and I thought this would be great for him to chew on to gain strength in his face. I could see these being great for other children without special needs, especially when teething. I love that they are free of toxic chemicals so I know it's safe!"
"The end fitting came off the hose in the first 5 minutes.  Worthless product.  Also water flow is hopeless. Really shoddy product. Also read Housables' terms and conditions before buying  You have to pay return shipping all the way to California.  Product name should be Worthless instead of WorthtrustChris Comer. NC."
"When this thing gets in the heat its pretty much ruined. Velcro pretty much just peels right off. Save your money."

"I wish that I could upload the images of how different my Truck looks now that I gave it New Eye Glasses!!!! Hahaha #Beautiful"
"Best massage ever!  I have fibromyalgia and could not get through the day without it.  I definately recommend this product!!!"
"This game is a unique one, has a well made storyline that is relevant(UFOs phenomenon) and is not as gloomy and scary as most HO games are nowadays. The game has movie clips with real actors, in which you need to notice which objects appeared in them. It has well created HO scenes as well, graphics are clear and crisp, sounds are good. It is a lengthy game, and has a replay value. The developers of this game did a good job! I recommend this game to all the ones that appreciate the HO genre."
"This game is complete fun. It is addictive awesome cool bosses  and most of all downright hilarious the hero's blade is my favorite weapon"
"Bought this tablet for my 9 year old son as a gift. it worked for 1 month and now its inoperable. Powering it on to the android symbol on the screen is as far as it goes. Wont proceed booting after that. Ive searched high and low for troubleshooting advice and have come up with nothing. I am beyond disappointed and angry."
"Fun game to play with friends. Will keep you laughing for hours. Content geared towards adults so I don't recommend playing with children around."
"This cell  phone holder works great, will hold the pantech p7040 Link phone securely, even if it has a snap on cover. Well worth the money."
"I Really loved this book. I've read it over and over again. In fact I've read all read all three books over and over.  And yes I would tell someone they should read the whole trilogy. Thumbs up!"
"I Really loved this book. I have read it over and over again. In fact I've read all three books over and over again.  Thumbs up!"
"cheez its were all brokin when the got to my house very upset and its like that with chips ive ordered"
"We love the big bang theory and watched the whole season in just a few days. Now I am already waiting for season 6!"
"The battery, though a higher mA rating than the one that came with the camcorder, doesn't last as long. The charger gets points for accepting 12v DC and 110v AC power sources. The large tripod is a terrible, terrible joke. Even the tiny Sony HDR camcorder was too much for it and the storage bag tore the first (and last) time I used it. The tiny tripod appears to be a child's toy; placing any weight on the supposedly positionable legs causes them to buckle, unevenly, meaning you cannot aim the camera in any direction reliably. The mounting device broke the first (and last) time I used it. The SD card is fine, as is the USB adapter for the card. The bag, however, is much too small to carry even half of these accessories along with a camera of any size, and both side zippers pop open with even the slightest pressure. I have to assume the bag was meant to be a method for storing tripods during their trip to the garbage. At least that's what I used it for."
"This book is funny,cool,awesome,and extra romantic.I love the funny characters and the CCPS.Including,Mackenzie,Jessica and Brandon.My favorite character is Nikki. I love this book and I hope you do to."
"This is the one cd by Bon Jovi i didn't have. I love it especially the ballafs. Who ever is a fan should buy this cd it is great"

"It looks really good. They are the perfect size and looks just like the picture. It arrived rather quickly also"
"It looks just like the picture which is a plus but it arrived chipped and a big chunk is missing"
"I love it. It showed up really really quick and in a very secure bag. It fits great and looks exactly as expected."
"Its awesome, tastes just fine and has great focus and intensity! Much better than Jack3d or C4. Save it for heavy training days though, as it is potent"
"This thing is beefy, heavy duty, and is awesome for T-bar rows and weighted chin ups. I dont even have a cable machine and it is very useful."
"I am stacking this with 3.5 g D-Aspartic Acid and definitely have some higher test going on. I have made some good steady gains and have a higher work capacity"

"I really like playing this version of bejeweled. It is one of the better match 3 games I have found.The price is right and the graphics are good"
"my computer would not load it as it said there was too much risk to have it put on my machine"
"Wasn't sure about this book but am glad I read it as it is quite an entertaining book. Light read that keeps you entertained."
"Door stops are good for non heavy use and non heavy doors.  For heavy duty use spend a bit more."
"My son loved it and it's super cute ! We'll worth the money ! Bought about a year ago and has held up really good !"
"The charging station works well with our remotes (Nintendo and generic). I like that it plugs into the usb port on the console. However the battery packs do not hold their charge very long (maybe an hour max). Still better than buying a ton of AA batteries."
"The screen protect itself seems to be durable and will last awhile, but it did not fit correctly it was too long so I had to trim it to fit my zeki 10."
"This remote and nun chuck both work very well with the console. I bought it for the wii motion plus and it works great with the games. The item description was very accurate."
"Shipping from amazon was fast and packaged nicely.  The system worked great.  Used it on 3 of my rifles. Fired my savage .223 at 100 yards with a nikon monarch scope and put 30 rounds at sub MOA.  Would highly recommend the leveling system."
"I'm so glad I purchased it for my new niece to be.  It is just perfect!  Such a great gift!"
"To my uncle Albert I love the book this book is going to be so special to me because of my daddy last words to me was your uncle Albert made a book and call your uncle about it I wish my dad was a live to see that his brother book has arise I love you daddy and uncle Albert and the book was wonderfully I couldn't  stop reading it ! God bless"
"Love the games"
"Bought this for my fiance's phone and he says it's alright. It does obstruct the buttons a bit, it's a little hard to press what you want as the bottom part of the case protrudes too far upward but in general... It's alright. It will do lol."
"Me encanto, y el tiempo de entrega fue el prometido, super cool, recomendado 100% para trasacciones y compras de sus ofertas. Gracias!"

"The K2V Cup works great.  I use it every day.  I wish I could buy the K vue cups in stores around here. the K2V Cup was a life saver.  Thank you."
"Great color and box. Easy to remove. Fits well and is slim enough to fit in pockets without bulging out."
"Really nice gear and will work perfectly on my trip to Belize. This set was missing a small piece that connects the mask to the snorkel but Amazon and I came to an agreement that was satisfactory to both parties."
"Most people are so useless with their money. This book explains a ridiculously simply wealth creation strategy and is delivered in a facscinating story-telling way"
"Be prepared to have your world rocked if you think that you are &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;. Learn how you are actually manipulating others into liking you and not even really succeeding. Changed my whole world"
"This is the only thing that has ever worked for me to quit smoking.  Highly recommend you read it all the way thru"
"Good read can't wait for the next 100 books. I will be waiting to buy each one of them. thank you"
"The way the picture looks on the website, it looks like a bangle. Once received I saw that it was a small, itty bitty ring that I had no use for at all. Basically just gave my money away. I know next time I need to read very closely before purchasing anymore items. But I don't like the ring, it would not have been a choice I would have made hadI known it was a small baby ring."
"First of all when it came wasn't the brand I ordered. Poorly put together. Loud as can be. All I can say it works but for how long."
"Give it a try, different twist to the comics books, probably a bit better, can't wait for the 3rd season."
"Too cute! I really like it ! Nice and affordable! Stylish girlie and the look is in!!  Love love love love this"
"ONCE again James Patterson delivered a great story that kept you on edge tell the end great beginning middle and end I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense action and intriguing story line this book is for you. Can't wait for his next book...."
"Norton 360 becomes inactive when the computer is put into standby.  I have to restart the computer many times each day to reactivate.  Spent approximately 6 hours on the telepnone with Norton support trying  to correct the problem.  However, support was never able to come up with a solution.  According the the Norton forums, many people are having similar problems with Norton 360."
"Dumb book. There was neither plot, nor substance. Where is the evidence of the so called &amp;#8220;tough heroine?&amp;#8220; I am glad this was a free book and I can easily delete."
"I love this strope!  Works well.  The only problem was of its length as well as its mislead picture.  The length just makes it a little more a hassle where you would have to repeat the runs on strope a few more times.  The two seperate stropes you see on the picture is actually one strope.  Overall, been using straight razors for a while and can honestly say this is a great buy!"
"Loved it!!  Could not stop reading! Extremely enticing book keeps you on your toes.  Cannot help but fall in love with Derek and Sofia together."
"Keeps you lured in... absolutely LOVE this series... Cannot wait to start book 6!  There is always some type of suspense mixed with the romance part of the story.  :)"
"Excellent drill bits,wish I would have found these years ago.I will be getting more very soon. Thanks a bunch Amazon"
"This review will be short and sweet. Very sweet. I loved The Cardigans since I discovered that they were the first band on the moon. As a band, they have released some incredible records,  &amp;#34;Long Gone Before Daylight,&amp;#34; being a favorite. I have always enjoyed Nina Persson's voice. It is truly original and very organic. I will not review each song in and of itself because it isn't necessary. This isn't The Cardigans and it isn't A-Camp. This is Nina Persson! With that being said, this is a fantastic record! Her voice is just as soothing as I remember it to be. You can tell her voice has matured and that is a good thing. It flowers some of the songs with a tinge of graceful raspiness. Just a tinge, mind you. In short, I am very excited about this album. Indeed, I hope it does well for her. Hopefully a hard copy will be easier to find real soon. You WILL NOT regret buying this record, so quit reading this silly review and BUY it already!!!"
"Well written and creative! Loved the story for the most part.The characters are strong, especially Beatrice. Her thoughts and feelings are strong and the interaction she has with the others works well throughout. The story really drew me in. Seeing the different factions and how different they were and how they interacted was really interesting. How Beatrice overcame obstacles and progressed through the story made me want to keep reading more and more.The story is fast paced, the action intense and keeps you involved.Parts where I think the story could've been better were the character development. I think it was good, but it could've been a lot better in my opinion. I didn't connect with the main character as much as I would've liked to. Not that it was bad, because the character was really good, I just think it could've been better.The ending was okay. The emotions seemed off at the end. I felt it was a bit rushed. That was really the only time in the book when I wasn't connecting with the characters. The ending was left hanging for the next book.  If you're looking for a book that sums up completely, this isn't it. There will probably be a few more on the way. But it's definitely worth it.(Possible Spoilers)I think some parts came too easy to her, like the Capture the Flag game. I felt like it could've been more of a struggle and it would've felt like the victory was more of an achievement. The interactions between her and Four was good, but sometimes I felt like it was lacking. Also I felt like security in the area should've been better. It was far too easy for some of the more evil characters to commit violent acts against each other and get away with it.Overall I loved the book and would recommend it. Not book of the year but very good."
"I WOULD JUST SAY DONT BUY CANT EVEN HEAR ANY THING OUT OF THE DAMN THINGS WASTE OF CASH SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"BUY IT I HAD IT IN MYS CAR FOR BOUT A YEAR AND IT WORKS EVERY TIME&amp;#62; HAVE AND OLDER CAR AND IT WORKED JUST FINE HAVE IT ON MY *# CHEVY CAPRICE AND ITS AMAZING I WOULD BUY IT IF I WAS YOU"
"Plugged it in, followed the directions for installing (the ones in the product discription on the web site) and my xbox 360 controler found it and started working. The little disk that came with it was broken in half inside the box, but as it turns out, you don't need it so I didn't care."
"I put this drill through the toughest work at coldest temperatures in Alberta, Canada and it hasn't let me down. Thanks Dewalt."
"El libro me ha enganchado, pero me esperaba mas trama. Se hace demasiado predecible y facil el final. Todo demasiado bonito!!!"
"So... this did not come with instructions in english. Haha I ended up having to match the Japanese (?) letters as if they were symbols to the directions we were given. It looks really nice on my wall and I get a lot of compliments, but the assembly was a complete headache."
"I am very happy with my purchase. I ordered this case and keyboard to use with my iPad so that I could take notes on my iPad. I am a college student that does a great deal of note taking per day. I was very pleased with my purchase. The case is a great color and the keyboard is awesome. There was a small readjustment period where I had to get accustomed to the keyboard because the keys are a little smaller than average and the shift key is a little farther over than I'm used to, but it really wasn't a big issue. The only thing was that I had to order a stylo from a separate vendor because this one didn't come with one, but it was terribly cheap (like $3.00) so I wasn't too upset about that.The package arrived on time and in perfect condition. All in all, I have no major complaints and would definitely order from this vendor again."
"NOT EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT BUT WORTH IT! IT IS VERY FUNCTIONAL FOR COFFEE TEA OR ANYTHING ELSE NEEDED TO KEEP WARM."
"It my first time to buy from this brandI orderd size 7.5 / size fit perfectly also they are comfortable and lightI love them ^_^"
"I didn't care for it. It doesn't fit my phone the way that it is suppose to. I won't buy another one like this."
"Was a gift for a 9 year old, she loved it. She has it hanging on the wall in her room."
"This was a gift, she loved it. She has it on her bed. She sleeps with it every night.Loves it."
"i like this product and i really enjoyed it and its good to read my favorite books and i would reccomend it to other"
"I love this wallet.  It looks, feels, and smells of good quality leather.I bought it because I needed more room for cards, and this is exactly what this wallet is about.Be careful though, more cards means a bulky wallet, in your back pocket."
"the manageable size makes it very portable.  For the first 3 weeks, my son used to call it his new iPad!anyway, the way the white, black and transparent board are installed in the frame is unbelievably bad.  All three boards are lose, and gall off anytime."
"i like the arm band case. it fits perfectly on my arm. i can workout with all my fav music"
"Perfect size for the space needed. It has met my expectations . The price was great and so is the lamp."
"Have used it for the pack n play and the babies carriage. Works great! Easy to pack in convenient bag"
"My grandson enjoys using this outside and at camp. Easy to carry and set up. Works great outside since it is light and easy to carry."
"Time flew by when I was reading this book due to the depth and comfort felt with each and every character. A book that has you empathising with people who are in situations that are, hopefully, totally alien to you.This book has you thinking of life styles and life choices from angles you never knew existed.I envisage Ellie and Coop having a wonderfully happy, contented life together and Katie eventually carving a satisfying life for  herself. But I am unsure if she would end up sharing it with Samuel or just devoting herself to being the best person she can be."
"this ball came in a box with other items, the glass in the gal was broken and the blue liquid ruined the other items. was supposed to be a gift."
"Presidential  dollar coin collection  book find and as expected.  Ad says includes free DVD.  did not receive.

"There are so many things to say about this game I'd probably go into it for another 30 minutes if I weren't short on time.  This game is a winner through and through.  The graphics and the music are both terrific, and the control scheme is exactly what it should be for a 3d Sonic game, unlike most of the new ones coming out on Gamecube, PS2 and all the newer systems.  This is the one that came out before all those, so it rightfully deserves credibility.  Even if this game wasn't very good, it would still be a must have just to showcase what Sega's dream was, but they perfectly portrayed that dream with the Sonic Adventure.  The story is a little weird at times as in not explaining things not to mention the ending was a bit corny, but who cares?  This game is a LOOOOOAAAAAD of fun.  If you want the ultimate Sonic experience, then you need to have this game.  It cost a little extra to get the original case, but it was definitely worth it.  Alright Sega!"
"This game gets a 5 out of 5 for several reasons.  One, it looks great.  Whoever designed it obviously thought highly about it and didn't mind poking fun at Pac Man quite a bit, which either works to your advantage or disadvantage depending on scenario.  Pac Man is basically  your pet; you have to instruct him where to go, how to react in situations and help him escape trouble and do Mrs. Pac Man's bidding.  It's a family oriented game, and does not have your typical control scheme.  Pac Man will walk himself and you just point which way to go.  Sometimes Pac man gets scared, happy or sad, and it depends on what you make him do, and how you do it.  I don't know how to classify this game exactly, let's just say it's one of the great ones.  The way I see it it's greatly underrated.  In fact, the only problem I have with this game is how it freezes and resets itself constantly, which I assume is because it's so old.  So, renew this game on some newer models on the Sega Master system, and you're on your way.  Did I mention you can play classic Pac Man on this too? Of course I did.  It gets a 5 out of 5.  If you have a copy, keep it because this game should go into your chronological order of Pac man in Pac Man world. Definitely a fun game."
"I love this game. sure it was a little hard trying to find out what to do, but all in all the story is amazing with really good cut scenes. the  controls aren't bad, and the first person shooter mode is cool too. starting in the middle of nowhere in the winter means you do a lot of running in the snow, and you may run out of patience, but if you can just give the game a chance, it' worth it.  Also, if you analyze the game closely, it really feels more like Resident Evil. I think this game was created before those, and the creators of Resident Evil were inspired.  I feel really satisfied and accomplished playing this game, even if i only got the first disc. all in all there's a total of 4 of them, and it will leave you wanting more. It didn't come in the original package, but for the price it was worth it."
"If you're looking for revolutionary gameplay, this is not the game for you however, it does have an interesting story as well as good music by Bowie with him as a character in the game.  It came in on time and works perfectly.  Very interesting story and a good edition to the Dreamcast collection"
"This game was so explosive when it first hit shelves, the rumor was that the creators spent over $8000 just to make it or something like that. It's a story of a young man who is on a journey to avenge the death of his father, and well, it goes from there.  The graphics are highly stylized in and located in Japan, where you talk to people, ride motorcycles, play arcade games, train, hunt people down, make phone calls and more throughout different towns and villages.  This is just the icing on the cake, but let's say the amazing thing about this game is that it emulates real life so perfectly and on such a deserving system,  It has I believe, 4 disks to it, and I wouldn't dare leave this life without one.  Very good game.  A must have."
"Simply put, this game will make someone extremely happy to own.  However, as far as graphics and gameplay, I could pass up on it.  Still, this game would be terrific to watch someone else play, and it came in the case and all.  As always I'm a fan of original casing. So, although I don't care for these early models of fighting games, it works out okay.  Ultimately I was addicted to SNES Street Fighter, so I can't help but be a little unimpressed.  Still, it's a good game and recommended."
"what can i say, its a classic and works smooth. its fun dancing and singing, but you'll be rendered helpless if your maracas or sensor dont work, as was the case for me. it's also VERRRRY loud so be prepared for that too"
"This game gets a 5 out of 5 because it's simply awesome!  The music and graphics manage to develop a world you're immediately sucked into, not to mention I like all the main characters.  If you like Final Fantasy, I consider this a must have."
"Well, it's original.  It's different.  It's terrifying.  It's daring.  It's animated.  It's sheer joy.  This game pretty much pushes the power of the PS2 to the limit.  I received it in the original case of course, and it wasn't too expensive to buy honestly.  If you're a PS2 collector, adventurer and like fantasy, you got to have this game."
"It looks good and plays well.  I cannot complain. If you're like myself you want at least 4 controllers for your Dreamcast.  I recommend this sale."
"Well, to make a long story short, it came in perfectly, and worked perfectly. I  give this audio cord two thumbs up!!"
"Its super helpful to have these if you don't want your ears pierced, but you gotta be mindful that they do irritate the ears a tad bit because of the magnet, and do fall out quicker than an earring with a stud."
"Absolutely, above and beyond.  When I ordered 32x, I was worried about the cords. Thankfully, I found this immediately, and it works with no problems whatsoever."
"I ordered a large tagine but received a small one. Very disapointed as we cant use it. They gave me a return authorization but it does not worth the time to return it . I will give it and ordered another one elsewhere.They dont give any measurements......Why??"

"Laurel is now in senior year at Del Norte High School. Despite all that happened, she tries to live a normal life. But when Tamani enrols as an exchange student at her school, all becomes even more complicated.In my review of Spells, I was starting to dislike Laurel, I don't know if I'm the only one? Things got worse in this book. It's a pity because it's the only negative thing I have to say about the book, this book was a lot about Laurel's relationship with the two men, I didn't mind it and I loved Tamani as always.I can understand that it's hard to choose between two people you have interest in, but she's bringing it to the next level. Poor David and Tamani! And yeah, she's still acting careless even after what happened in Spells and what Jamison told her. She never learns of her previous mistakes I guess.I loved that some chapters were from Tamani's perspective. I think it made me even more in love with him then before. Laurel must choose him, I'm team Tamani even more then before!But the end&amp;#8230; I want to read the last book now! For the first time in the series, there's a real cliffhanger at the end. I love cliffhangers even if they can be frustrating, especially if the book is not out yet. Luckily, this one is. And I will be reading it soon!"
"For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]Calla Tor is a young Guardian of the Nightshade pack. As the alpha of the pack, she always knew one day she would have to mate with the alpha from the other pack, Ren Laroche from the Bane pack, to form a new pack and continue to protect Vail's sacred sites for the Keepers. One day on patrol, she encounters a human boy being attacked by a bear. Against the pack laws, she saves his life and in the process reveals to him the existence of werewolves. But when she sees him at school as a transfer student the next day, she knows everything will change.Love triangles everywhereA love triangle, again. I love it! We have on one side Ren, the handsome alpha male, and on the other side Shay, the beautiful human boy. Who wouldn't want to be in Calla's position and have these two guys after her? I loved the contrast of the two relationships, how with Shay it was sweet and with Ren more intense and physical. They each have something different to offer to Calla. I think I'm team Ren, but I'm not sure yet. I found Calla and Ren to have the same passion and they understand each other because of their position in the pack. And he's the ""bad boy"".Great charactersAndrea Cremer did a great job with her characters. First of all, I liked Calla. I think she's a strong and very loyal heroine. She knows what she wants and she doesn't let anyone tell her what to do. She wants to do her own choices. She's strong enough to tell the handsome and sexy male alpha Ren that she's not one to share with other girls. She also wants to be his equal in leading the pack. She was a bit egoist by moments, but I really enjoyed the book anyway. Ren, Shay, Ansel, Bryn... I also cared for all these characters.Lack of informationI was around page 100 and there wasn't any explications about Keepers, Guardians, Searchers, etc. yet. Luckily, it was easy to understand without these information in the beginning but I think the author should have introduce a little bit of information in the beginning.An amazing cover for a good bookThe book cover (the hardcover one, not the paperback) is just incredibly gorgeous. I love the purple color and the calla lilies at the bottom. I remember being totally in love with this cover when it came out. Overall, the book was good and makes me want to read Wolfsbane but something was missing for me to make it four stars. Maybe because the main focus seemed to be the romance and it's not enough for me."
"The book hooks you from the beginning to the end.  Another great book in a series from Lynsay Sands.  I enjoy the historical books Lynsay Sands writes as much as her vamp books.  If you haven't read a good book lately give this author a try."
"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I have read and re-read this book many times.  My favorite so far."
"I absolutely love these shoes I ordered them in red  they look expensive but They are definitely not . I can wear them with pretty much anything I want . Runs True to size, very flat."
"I love the look and price of the case..very sturdy ,.however anytime u grab it by the top the case will split and cause your phone to drop. Considering the price I won't complain"
"This is a great product for our Native Birds in North Carolina. The squirrles also enjoy it too.  In my opinion Scott's makes the best bird food. Our birds love it!"
"One of the best Leadetship Tools I've ever used! Highly Recommend this book! It is well worth reading and will give you measurable results. Additionally, it is a great template for approaching different ways to positively impact those around you."

"I've used a lot of this kind of color, but never had I have such good results and long lasting!"
"Three knives at this price, nobody is expecting a high-end performance.  For the price they look nice and fun for throwing at soft targets.  Probably smart to throw over carpet v a hard tile or concrete surface.  Don't plan on using these for a street fight, they're only slightly better than screaming for help."
"I like this quiz game its awesome. sometimes I get stuck on the movies its really cool and awesome you should get this app."
"My rack did not survive the shipping process. When I took out of the box it was all bent up. I tried straightening it and one of the metal racks broke off. Needless to say it is still bent and broken."
"Strong female characters that are put in their place by hot men. The relationships seemed a bit rushed but a well written plot. Wish it was a longer read."

"yes I love my pink earplug it really works for me and I will recommend this item to everyone in the family."
"i love the color and size. i will recommend this item to all of my family and i pick that rating because the item is good."
"i like the way it look online, but in person it was too too big on me and i did not like that part."
"It was not true to the size, but that was okay my daughter was able to fit it. yes tell someone."
"it is romantic and creative, although the author has potential for better stories, and sweep the readers off their feet."
"there was nothing in this book that came with any surprise. the epilogue was far more interesting than the whole book. seems like the author wrote this just to finish up the mess she started with a mind to give Ana and Christian a happy ending.I still look forward to what will come next from EL. James, but only if it is unrelated to the damn fifty shades."
"its pretty awesome. its not just the concept but the way the story has been written. i just couldn't put the book down till i finished it :)"
"When I received this product I was hoping I would be able to extend my laptop battery life, I followed the instructions regarding letting the battery completing discharge then re-charge 2-3 times.  After doing this the product was no better than my original battery of 6 years old.  The battery life was horrible.  The battery life did not extend to anything close to the times stated by the battery's description or by other users.Luckily, I was able to get a credit of $24 back from the vendor.  This was the result of a complaint I made to them regarding excessive costs at the USPS to send the product back to CA from MO.BUYER BEWARE!good luck"
"When I first got the wallet, I was surprised by how big and spacious it was. I didn't expect nine credit card slots, id slot, and two secret compartments. IT IS AWESOME. Also, when I first laid eyes on it, I thought it would be too bulky and uncomfortable, but it was very soft and light even after I filled ALL THE SLOTS.It's a good wallet, people who are complaining are most likely just negative Nancy's or fags"

"I love my new luggage set, very roomy, durable, and plenty of luggage. This is my first ever luggage set, and I hope they last me forever."
"I definitely recommend this book to any first time home buyers. Or just home buyers in general ... This book definitely helped me with knowing how to pick and chose the lender that best suited my needs. I hope whoever buys it , gets something from it like I did !"
"I must say , I wish I could thank the Author myself ! I have had many doubts when it comes to opening a franchise , but this book has really opened my mind to many things. It's so easy, and simple to understand, and it walked me thru the process. As well as helped me step by step with focus on my approach to opening a franchise !"
"yeah its fricken fun on a bun. cheers and have a nice day you bored masses of the planet. filler."
"Best books ever get all of the Mike lupicas comeback kids novels the best one is two minute drill. I think it is any way"
"I got these as a gift for a friend of mine. She loved them and wears them constantly. She has not described how comfortable they are, however when I was packaging them to give to her, the material felt soft and stretchable."
"Love this piece it took some time to get it but it came from China and the seller was very polite but the crystal came out when I dropped my phone and it's no way to fix it it's easy to take off when your ready for it to come off but this product also messed up my home button it twist and moves and isn't supposed to but my home button still works"
"I most absolutely love this case it's my most favorite and the delievery was fast I purchased it Friday and received it Tuesday and it was brand new still n pack very authentic might b the best cell phone case I've purchased n a long time bc it's pink and bejeweled I'm n love it was a lil expensive though that's the only thing I don't like I don't think it should cost the same price as the store on Amazon but other then that I like it"
"The endless winter is finally gone, and we NEED to look like the summer sun.  I LOVE this watch.  I knew I wanted ceramic, but this one stands alone.  It keeps great time, has a distinctive look with the pieced bracelet, and is comfortable all day.  I get complements EVERY time I wear this beautiful watch!"

"xmas gift for my 3 year old who got his first game system a wii! I was very skeptical about it being too hard but I wanted to encourage the physical movement. We live in a crappy area so I don't take him out much unless its far from here. So I wanted something that could get him playing and moving without going to the local parks! Great buy Its really easy for him! He loves all the characters even though hes not into tv he started to like them with this game! Hes really into books so I didn't think he would like this but he really loves it and he plays for about 30 minutes a day with me! (It really is a workout lol) Great for parents and kids to do together!"
"Okay phone brought it to replace a blackberry! It CANT replace a blackberry! Dumbest replacement ever! Its good for people who dont care to have high end phones. It has email, web, text, phones, picture mail etc... Its okay picture quality is gross -_- seriously no good and messages take a while to send/receive and web is superrrr slow but that cause im used to the blackberry so for others it might not seem so bad. Its okay overall. buy with caution!"
"Gift for a 7 year old girl who likes monster high and likes dressing up. Great accessory and comes in decent size box so looks like it cost more then the actual price (which was low)."
"Not much to say about this only cause its a small item. Great price does the job no scratches thus far!"
"This was an OK read, but lacked pace and maybe it was just me, but I found it was a bit difficult to follow"
"works great.. i needed to replace my broken one and it does the job just like its suppose to! very happy with this purchase"
"This candy tasted good but is good only if you do not have any side effects from it. I tried it twice and on both occasions, it caused me massive and incapacitating diarrhea. I do not have lactose intolerance nor any other food allergy. No sure what is contained in these candies that caused me massive diarrhea (12-14 watery stools within next 12-14 hours). Were these infected ? Did they have toxin? Not sure if this batch was defective or generally contains harmful substances. I ate these candies around a year back at which time they seemed to be fine. But this time, they caused me lots of trouble. I am sure that these candies caused my symptoms as I tried nothing new nor did I eat out.  Just had these candies on 2 separate occasions 2 days apart. At the first incidence, I couldn't believe that a candy can cause diarrhea to a non allergenic person so ate it again 2 days after and had similar bouts of diarrhea, this time even worse just a couple of hours after having candies.Pretty sure that these caused the diarrhea. Not to mention that I am pretty tolerant to anything and everything in food. Had no food allergies so far. Won't recommend these to anyone."
"Just what I was expecting!  Have had the headset for 20 years and the originals finally wore out.  I should be good now for another 20."
"This collection of six horror stories is entertaining. Turkish Night is a surreal and violent story about belly dancing competitors. Never Leave Me stars a possessive husband and a ghost, with an interesting twist to the ending that I really liked. In The Painted Staircase, a troublemaker on a museum tour gets more than he bargains for. The Colour of Dishonor is a chillingly different kind of historical horror story with a cruelly dishonorable character who finds himself haunted by his sins. I Dived the Pandora is a scary story about a wreck dive gone terribly wrong. Enjoyable collection."
"When I purchased the inverter there were many other options to go with but I am glad I went with Sunforce. It is performing great and came when expected. I'll order another before I go with a different company."
"This game is super addicting! If you like flappy bird you'll like this too! It is so much fun! I' d recommend it."
"This is a another great review book after first aid. I try to cover the first aid gaps from this book. great organized book. I would highly recommend you to buy it. Great seller. I would love to come back and buy more books off this seller."
"I bought this couple of months ago. it works well with the batteries comes with this but it has loose connection problem with the batteries I have (2As and 3A). I would give 3 stars just for the price."
"go for it with out even thinking. I been had this for last 1 year. I bought many different headphone but they dont last it for long because of GYm workout. this is a similar to skull candy $12 headphone. this is cheaper and last longer. go for it you wont go wrong."
"I love it! I have to keep buying replacements because my friends and family keeping taking mine! Can't beat the price!"
"It's suitable for my arm,not too tight or losse.Fit for Medium arm i guess. It just okey for the price!"
"I often find that authors of such manuals try to fit the square peg of their own experience as SF or SWAT into the round hole of operations of civilian self defenders during WROL, TEOTWAWKI etcThis often results  poorly adapted drills, comments, judgments.But none of such errors in judgement can be found in Max's book.Everything he writes makes logical and operational sense and is adapted for the situations he writes about.I am convinced that as his book ""Contact"" slowly percolates thru the community it will achieve cult status within a decade or two, as THE basic manual that fits the ""civilian caught in SHTF"" PoU.There is nothing else like it out there and IMO it's a future classic!"
"Patriot Dawn: It's fantastic for what it is.A novelization of Max's tactical manuals especially CONTACT and (I suspect since i have not read it yet) ""Rapid Fire"".I can tell some people where  a bit unenthused about the plot being a little thin. In my mind that's ok,. don't expect a Tom Clancyuesque yarn but something more valuable instead:A Tactical Manual written as a novel.  Everything he writes is in order to illustrate a tactical lesson he wants to teach.And he has  a lot to teach!I think this may be the best way to learn for many folks who simply can't get themselves to pick up a manual.Even though Max's manuals are not nearly as dry as most, I think this novelization approach may work quite well for many.Sometimes a plot element may seen a little contrived, just keep in mind what it's purpose is. If you want intricate plot twists, well developed characters and brilliant timeless dialogue, look elsewhere.If you want to learn while you read, this is the place.The book is best read using a pen and paper and drawing out the tactical situations as they occur in the book.A Map of Virginia to follow along is also helpful and aids in understanding.Be advised at the end of the book is a index of acronyms common in Combat arms.. check it out before you read.I hope everyone enjoys the book!PS: The plot thickens near the end  and there is a cliffhanger, can't wait until the next book ; )"
"This is a cute movie, sad that people burn each other people like that though in that profession. all in all thought, we love Zac Efron and can't see him doing a bad movie."
"That's what she did! My granddaughter saw this movie at school and talked about it so much I decided to get it for her birthday. SHE LOVED IT, to say the least. Last count, she has seen it 30 times."
"My granddaughter celebrated her 12th birthday this year. Her theme, you guessed it, Peacock! the feathers were a little smaller than expected and fell apart quite easily if they are touched to much but in a vase they were perfect. I especially like that they were shipped earlier than said which turned out to be a really good thing."
"I would recommend this product to anyone that has a small space for food prep.  Works great.  Prompt shipment. Handy and dishwasher safe."
"Dead Space 2 is among one of the best games that I have ever played. Dead Space combines horror with TPS and does so without a conflict in my opinion. The Gameplay is fun there are a lot of scares. The graphics for the game are amazing and really well done in my opinion. Other horror games that I have played are FEAR, FEAR 2 PROJECT ORIGIN,FEAR 3, and Dead Space. I would recommend all of these to people who enjoy shooter games both FP and TP but also enjoy horror games as well. Dead Space 3 will be released in February I believe and I hope to see the series continue after Dead Space 3 is released. I also feel the same for the FEAR series as well."
"this  book  was great i read made you want more so  and rushed out to purchase 2 and  3 right away"
"I read parts one and two in a day and 1/2 and found that they were both very good if there is a part 3 I would buy and read it as well ."
"I have this a five and would recommend this series as a good read .i don't believe that this is the end of the twins and another book is coming ."
"The boots look sturdy enough, altough i have to try them in the field, maybe i will go hunting this weekend.They are also pretty comfortable, i just walked a couple miles today with them and i have no sore feet. Also they arrived sooner than i thought, thats a big plus."
"I ordered this phone case for my older brother, and he likes it.the item looks exacltly like a picture shown."
"i love this. great neutral tones. only downside is that some of the colors don't blend as well as the others."
"I got this for my cat obsessed friend and she loves it. She's 5 ft 1 and 115lbs. A size small fit her perfectly."
"It's fun and entertaining for not only me but my friends.. but you could work on it and make th bird a lil faster"
"I Love  this book, I' ve made some breads, And the result was delicious And the bread is so healthy! So thanks!  I recommend it ! You should have it, if you like to eat healthy."
"Long ago I bought the XP version of this book.As it saved me a fortune I bought the Vista version for use with my wifes new  Vista laptop. I personally am staying with XP. Since the demise of system hand books there is a need for books that give clear &amp;#34;how to do it&amp;#34; instructions and examples and this series is well above average in this respect. This book is not only for the aged and wrinkled but anyone that has been lumbered with this computer operating system."
"THIS IS MY SECOND TIME ORDERING THIS BATTERY, DONT OVER CHARGE IT BECAUSE IT WILL EXPLODE, BUT IT WILL LAST YOU FOR A COUPLE MONTHS."
"I loved this book. Can't wait to read the next one. I couldn't put this book down. A great read"
"I thought the battery will last longer but it also die to quic.just like the original one the comes with the phone."
"It is so comfortable. It looks like fashion. My friend should like it. It is a gift for the new year."
"It is so useful. And it looks like fashion. My friend should like it. It is a gift for the new year."
"It looks like nice. My 76-year-old father should like it. It is a gift for the new year of 2013"
"I really think that you should get this book because it is free and I know it is short but I love reading it over and over again."
"Reading this book made me kinda feel like tesla himself. Kinda innocent child who absolutely loved what he did. The fact the Tesla's work is not emphysized in modern educational systems worries me..READ IT!"
"this product did not work at all!!!! i was very disappointed. threw them away. a waste of my money!! I should of asked for a refund."
"Its lovely can fit my notebook and small fileI thought the inside would have more roomWill use the items to carry my school supplies"
"I really did not need this. My purse had a compartment for acer notebook chrome c7 and did not know this until I order this"
"Perfect it makes shredding cheese  easy perfect for slicing potatoes. You can make a fast salad or have cheese ready for Mac and cheese in a flash  I just love it . Thanks"
"I bought this wig on a different site and was just amazed at how ugly it was. there was pieces of hair sticking out, the bows were poorly put on and you can see the cap! not to mention it was shipped in a flat bag which was crammed in my tiny little mailbox! I would not recommend this wig to anyone!!!"
"Overall amazing product. Took a few extra days to get here. Looks great and the cover went on easy! only thing that was a problem was that the sticker on the screen protector would not come on off so i have glue smear on my screen"
"No complaints whatsoever. Very clear, people say they can hear me perfectly, even better than through the regular cordless phone. Volume adjustment, mute button."
"This Pyrex 2-Cup Measuring Cup should be a part of standard kitchen equipment in every household - it simply cannot be beat!"
"Great cutting board with suction type holders on the reverse side.  It also goes very well with my red kitchen d&amp;eacute;cor!"
"This dish has completed my collection of glass bakeware from Anchor Hocking.  They all are great to use and clean up very simply."
"Just what the doctor ordered!  Saves my sore backside from suffering while sitting down anywhere I may choose to go!"
"They're just SO cute on my frig, and several friends have also liked them.  Only one negative - the magnet on each is rather small but can still be used to hang up a note if you need to.  I really do like them a lot, and they are a nice addition for my &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; kitchen theme."
"This mask does its job very well and allows you to exhale without suffocating.  Does look a little strange on your face...."
"This book reminds me of the work i have been loving for the past 20 years.  Catering.  I have fine tuned my business in many ways because of what I have followed from this volume."
"Great recipes and mental aromas.  Makes you feel like you are in the middle Iran,  Cant wait for the next dinning experience."
"this unit is very easy to pair it's Bluetooth technology.  Ergonomic design of the keyboard matches the design of my laptop keyboard.  This made my transition easy."
"Recipes that help you with the natural way of eating.  This craft is perfect for hunters and fishermen alike.  a must read."
"This book draws you in from the beginning. I love that not only do you get one side but both!"
"Nice product but picture was deceiving when I ordered it. I thought I was getting more. But I'm happy with the service I got."
"If you're like me and happen to run out of space with only about 4 games left sitting on your shelf, this card is a great choice. It might not have a ton of space like other cards here on Amazon, but it's officially-licensed and it works perfectly. No problems, and fast delivery. If you need a little more space for your game collection, you can't go wrong with this."
"Loved the product...great seller...highly recommended !!! This book is a good starting point for those who wants to learn more regarding engine management."
"It came bent straight out of the packaging. It might have been just mine but I'm never buying the product again."

"MMy son loved the costume of Robin the stores didnt have his size they said they didn't want to order it any more because they were making Robin a girl"
"I bought the blades for my wifes dad who is very picky, he was pleased with the heavy steel. I would buy this pruduct again."
"use it for school and other stuff its great for stuff u wanna take on the go its so cool i waanna cry and feed my eyes to elves with a donut field"
"This bracelet is very nice quality. I have many various medical conditions and allergies, I was able to get a charm for them all.  I've shown the bracelet to my doctor and he was very impressed said he wished more people would wear them, makes it easier for emergency medical personnel. My bracelet came with the charms already on it, so somebody had to take the time to put them on which was great."
"I like playing this game but they don't give you many tokens to play with and the tournaments take 3 tokens."
"I bought this item awhile back and never got to use it because it was untuneable and the strings it comes with were the wrong kind for this type of guitar and when I took it in to get new strings they told me that the bridge was about to snap because of the tension from the strings it comes with. Also the pitch pipe is a piece of plastic trash. I could literally use nothing in this order.I will never buy any other product from this seller, because they lied to us all to get a sale and all we receive is garbage. So don't waste your money here"
"Good book.  I would recommend it to friends.  Enjoy the case studies.  Haven't finished reading it yet.  Thank you very much."
"I really like it because I can use my gift card.  The print is very clear.  I want to order another one."
"I received my case and keyboard cover. I was looking for a deal on both together, and I thought this looked like a good product. Be aware, the case is not crystal clear. There is a frost like quality or opacity to it. The keyboard cover is silver, not clear. However, I do like the silver keyboard, because it blends in nicely with the aluminum of the computer, and gives it a retro feel. Typing will take a bit of getting used to, but it is a good fit. The case fits nice as well, I just wish it was a little more see through. Another note on the keyboard cover- the power button key is painted with the eject symbol, leading me to believe that its for the Macbook Pro, but, again, to me its not a deal breaker. I am very happy with my purchase, and saved a good amount of money over buying a case and keyboard cover in a store."
"Please don't make the mistake I did and buy these thinking that you are getting a good deal...you are NOT. I have never had a problem with dual layer dvd+r disks before, so I also made the mistake of not reading any reviews.I bought the 50 disk spindle (DR8S8B50F/17). So far I have burned through 23 disks with 4 successful writes using DL.These disks have a problem when trying to write to the second layer as they all error at 50%; they will not continue to write. Burning a file a single layer size results in 100% success (I have done this on about 10 disks so far). So instead of a good deal on dl disks, these are rather expensive single layer dvd + r disks.Other info:I use ImgBurn (always have, always will). I have used dl media from Sony, Memorex, and mostly Verbatim with absolutely no errors (unless it was something I caused). I only bought the Philips because they were on sale and I'm always willing to try out new alternatives.I have tried on 3 seperate burners (Sony, LG, Pioneer)...same result (from 4x-8x)I am not going to accept the 'this is a bad batch' nonsense as there should be some sort of QC in place to prevent that.Ultimately, this product is a waste of money. I will never buy anything with the Philips brand again. As has been said time and time again you are better off buying the more (slightly more) expensive disks..."
"This book is hard to put down.  I haven't quite finished it, but my Kindle is recharging.  It has a great plot, lots of action, a great story line.  It is everything you look for when selecting your next book."
"I found this book heart warming.  The martyr was truly put through the wringer.  The enemies he made, the friends he found during his hiding, his intelligence all lead to a great story."
"Completely enjoyable.  I found myself laughing out loud in a waiting room while reading these humorous adventures.  Two elderly ladies who sleuth everything in their town.  A small town where mischief rebounds, dead bodies are found wherever they go, and plenty of antics keep these ladies entirely on the go.  Plus, they find themselves continuously helping their inept sheriff, who finds them bothersome.  Highly recommended."
"Love this song! She is a fabulous singer, probably will download more of her music. I think she is great!"
"Dyson is one brand you can count on, but, you can't buy their filters anywhere but on line. The vacuum is great, this site is fantastic! But DYSON should make their products filters easier to purchase!"
"Note 10.1 2014. Fits perfectly and looks very professional.  Elastic hand strip  is a little lose but comfortably snug. 2 day free prime shipping. Very pleased with product!"
"Very interesting advice well worth reading and help full in site to the American tax system if one has retired to the US"

"When I search strings like ""statement command"" it finds the phrase(4 cases exactly). However, the highlighted phrases are a few word off-focused. That is, in the following text snippet,'The Show Next Statement commmand...'""Show Next"" is high-lighted instead ""Statement command"". In this case, two words are off-focused.Additionally, quite a few graphic titles like ""Run to cursor"", ""Step Over"" are hard to recognize.Lastly, I felt a couple of pages are missing although I don't remember exactly where they are.As a overall judgement, I don't regret buying this book. I'm reading this book on my Android smart-phone, too.Take care,"
"Within 2 months(on Feb 9th), it's broken now. An after service center in Seoul(ROK) said. I need to bring it to the country(The US) where I bought it. Isn't this product a laptop which is easy to move around the world? I bought this product not only because it's cheap but also it's a product of HP which has a wide area of service chain world-wide. So, I don't understand why I have to bring the product myself to get service for a SSD malfunction?I don't recommend this product now.I bought it since it has SSD inside which is more vibration resistant and fast in multi processing stage.As a matter of fact, I was at a loss when it did not boot at first.However, I found out that I need to separate the battery and put it back again to make this laptop boot for the first time.Now it is working as normal. I'm writing this message using the laptop and over all judgement on this machine is that it is working as I expected. However, I don't know why it is this heavy. In fact, it is as heavy as the one with HDD on it or heavier than that.Still it boots fast cause it has SSD in it. Beside the speed, consider the price $400 something is super cheap at its performance isn't it?"

"I received this watch as a Christmas gift and have had it for 3 months now. If I had seen it in the store, I probably wouldn't have bought it for myself, but since now I actually have one.. I really like it and I would regret not buying it for myself. It seems very sturdy and it has all the features I like in a watch. It even has a pretty loud and annoying alarm, although I never use it."
"These rose petals could not have been a better price. They don't look 100% real, but they also don't look super cheap like some of the others I have looked into. If you are on a budget, then get these. they were perfect for my occasion. The best part is when your done you can reuse them and they do not stain like real petals would."
"This is the second time I have ordered screen protectors from this company. Both times I got super fast shipping. I was not supposed to get my product for another two days, but I got it early both times.Now time to review this particular screen protector, It seems like good quality, However, It does not grant as much privacy as a similar tech armor screen protector. Downfall for this screen protector is that it isnt as private as the tech armor one. Good thing though, is you get 3 screen protectors for around $5. But the Tech armor privacy screen protector was $8 for a pack of one!I would have given 5 stars, but it just isnt as private as other ones."

"I have been reading reviews,  visited Best Buy,  Verizon,  AT&amp;T,  and few other local stores that sell bluetooth speakers. I have purchased 2 other brands and returned them for poor performance. With all that said... I went to best buy this morning to buy either the bose min or Sony srx5.  I realized to get any reasonable sound quality I had to bump to the $200 price point. While looking a very helpful store attendant asked if I needed help. I noticed these TDK not on their shelf to listen to. I asked if he could open the box for me to just see the size.  He opened the box and the second I held the unit I immediately noticed it's weight (heavy enough to have good components but not to heavy to remain portable).  He then asked if I wanted to hear it.  I took him up on that offer.  Meanwhile the was another customer he had been helping choosing between the Logitech or bose unit.  The store person asked what I liked to listen to and I said journey.  He immediately synced his phone and started a journey track.  I was blown away instantly.  The clarity of the sound,  crystal clear highs and amazing base was shocking to say the least.  I knew I had just picked my speaker.  To my amazement the other shopper ready to buy the bose said ""holy cow"".  My reaction also to this speakers incredibly clear and rich sound.  I grabbed the last one unopened and the other shopper said pack that one back up... I am taking it.  So... Two people bought what I consider a sleepy secret in this overcrowded market of speakers. If you have never listened to this speaker and are looking to purchase any speaker from 150-200 range you absolutely owe it to your ears to find one and hear for yourself. You may just be amazed like I was. After all the looking and reviewing I had done I honestly thought that bose or Sony has the best sound.  I was so wrong.  It had a great speaker phone mic.  It has amazing battery life and you simply can't go wrong. I bought mine for 149.99 and would have paid 200 for it without hesitation.  Buy and enjoy."

"I became a fan of Tom Watson in 1977. I was working for the R &amp; A at Turnberry as an Official at The Open Championship. I remember distinctly even to this day, it was about 7.30 pm wednesday evening, it was the last practice day prior to the start the next morning. I was making my way back to the car park most everyone had gone home at that point.I was strolling across the eighth fairway, when I noticed two individuals on the tee to my right, of course it was Tom Watson and caddie Alfie Fyles. Tom had turned up late to practice,I watched him hit a few shots that evening, what a swing,what a ball striker! There was only Jack Nicklaus for me at that time in golf, but what I saw that evening was very special, and still is! I left the course and drove to my friends house and told him I had just seen the winner! So the upshot of all this is I am now the proud owner of Tom's book and DVD. I highly reccomend both of these! Thanks Amazon."

"""Child is father of man"". 'Blissful Discontent', a delightful book by Pritha Lal describes a series or epiphanies experienced by her as she took a break from her career to turn into a stay at home Mom, and watched with love as her little Parijat, so aptly named, helped her to find interesting parallels between infant behaviour and the set patterns of work behaviour in adults at their work place. Pritha says that she tried to take notice of things she had known all along ""from a less than three foot tall vantage point and the view has been spectacular.""Reading Mother Goose rhymes through her pregnancy quietens the ""two year old child with big bug eyes"", denoting familiarity, always a key word in motivation. As she grows, her amazing prowess in knowing close to two hundred words, being bilingual and retaining words with alacrity, are all linked to her parents' constant talking to her. Talking to her, never talking 'down' to her, for children are not balls of mush. They are not ignorant and their minds develop early. Finding clarity through the 'babble' is rewarding and highly motivating.Pritha, the mother, obviously takes precedence over Pritha, the professional, as she talks with pride about herself Parijat using everyday phrases like ""Check it out!"" , ""You did it!""  and the endearing ""I love you!"", which, of course, she adores. Visual learning reinforces the telling of a subject, be it ""sop sines"" (shop signs) or ""sop sop crowds"" (soft soft clouds). Their little girl has  her favourite toys - get purple stuffed Barney, a pink elephant watering can, fly swatter and the like, and she values the associations attached to each one of them.Comparisons are odious and timely praise motivates. Habit formation takes time and doing things repeatedly with enthusiasm is true motivation. It is these little nuggets of wisdom that Pritha puts across brilliantly in her book, relating them with baby steps taken by her precious daughter. Barney 's influence makes magic words like ""Please"" and ""Thank You"" an essential part of the conversation, and while there are things that can be taught, there are the intangibles like sharing and caring that need to be learnt on one's own.The book ends with Winnie the Pooh's heart warming advice, adapted simply by this amazing writer. ""Remove the fluff. It is so worth it!"""
"There are some books which evoke a sense of nostalgia, passion and love, of raindrops and balmy breezes, of light predicaments and romantic trysts! &amp;#8216;When I See Your Face&amp;#8217; is one of those. It is the story of Cathy, who resolves to start life over, &amp;#8220;without a husband who didn&amp;#8217;t love her and whom she had grown to fear and avoid, if not hate.&amp;#8221; Mark is the scheming charmer who treats her like a possession, and thinks it is his right to abuse her, whenever he is drunk.She falls in love with the picturesque little village that gives her sanctuary, as also with the intrepid Mrs. Grindle, who is like a ray of sunshine, wanting to mother and feed the young girl who has suffered so much.When she meets a stranger, Michael, who is the spitting image of her husband, Mark, her heart skips a beat in panic. The story twists and turns in most interesting ways, keeping the reader wondering as Cathy tries to come to terms with new relationships, which make her feel happy and secure. She concentrates on her own talents, so that she can make a living, all the while overwhelmed by feelings she has never felt before. One evocative line talks of how &amp;#8220;hope was starting to grow inside her, a timid, light green shoot reaching a slim arm out of the soil and into the sunlight&amp;#8221;.What happens when Mark and Michael come face to face?  What are the conflicts that have marred Michael&amp;#8217;s past, and threaten to undermine his present as well? Has Cathy made an error in judgment all over again? Numerous questions tickle the mind of the readers, as events meander by.Devika has a real flair for choosing the right words and phrases to embellish the romance in her story. Never ever is there a moment when the reader feels disappointed in her style, for it remains consistently beautiful and easy to read. There is an innocence in the narrative that tugs at one&amp;#8217;s heartstrings, and an old world charm that is missing in most modern books. It is also a story of progression, as Cathy grows stronger as a person, losing her vulnerability and low self esteem, as she finds herself able to live an independent and fulfilling life.The cover of the book exemplifies the serenity and the deep love within the hearts of the characters. If you love romance, do read &amp;#8216;When I see your Face&amp;#8217;! If you enjoy a twist in your tale, stretch your hand out and pick this book up! And finally, if you want to read something that makes you feel warm and happy inside, this is definitely the book for you!"

"works great and handy, my  playbook slides right in and out and its nice to have a stand as well"
"Just received this controller, and hoped for too much. the plastic feels cheap and clacky, and the buttons need firm, hard presses to get response from, specially thebuttons for moving right. i find i might be able to fix this if i open the controller and nudge a few pieces with some extra reinforcements, but for the average consumer, that shouldn't be necessary, and not everyone would have the know-how or the motivation for it.secondly, the driver is an issue as well, as it seems to have a mind of it's own to when it will allow the controller to work. it's a problem, because the pc won't always recognize the driver, or let the controller work, even when i'ts connected. This is only an increasing problem, as there's no alternative to this controller's driver.overall: it works, if you know how to make it work. nothing more, nothing less."
"The crate arrived in a fast and timely manner! The size is bigger than what I expected it to be, which is great for my miniature pinscher! The metal pan is very easy to clean. Sparkle is 8 weeks old and this crate is good for the  rest of her life! The color is awesome, and gorgeous! A pink crate for my princess, me and Sparkle is in  love with this crate!"
"I got this on a black friday offer... Just 200usd, and well... The price was just right haha. Sometimes it gets a little slower when I want to watch a movie online... But other than that it is great for school. The only think I truly hated was Windows 8... I went back to Windows 7 and it works just fine ;)"
"Great great great! Good price, good quality, super cute ;) if you check on any other pages you will find this way more expensive. The price is too good for be true!"
"Fits perfectly, it is uber cute. My students are always asking for it jaja, it has little eyes in the back and it looks at them during classes jaja. The price and quality are the best!"
"Great really love it cant waitto finish the rest of the book really excited ys moom cant wait for it"
"The Julian Chapter was a great sequel to Wonder. It was nice to hear Julian's point of view. It made me respect Julian more. I chose a four because I wanted Julian to become friends with Auggie. If that would have happened, I would have gave the book a five."
"I enjoyed this book. It brought me back to my past where I identified with the main character in terms of her feelings and coming of age. I did find Delaney to be unworthy of her but can't say its a crime for a girl to fall for a person who has flaws. Ultimately he is also coming of age and realizes the value of this person. He learns.  It's very real. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to the authors next novel!"
"I have just begun my journey with this story. I am loving it so far. Will write more later after more reading"
"I cannot say enough good about Alastair Sim. This is a must have. I HIghly recommend it. It is a tradition for me and my family to watch this beginning around Thanksgiving. It is heart warming. I had it on VHS and upgraded to this blue ray and even another for my son. This is true great acting. If I could only wish you would watch one movie at the Holidays, I would HIGHLY Recommend you watch this one. Remember what Christmas is really about. Giving. Sharing. Loving. Helping. GOD Bless us,  Everyone!"

"Stellar item. A must have for any pirate fan or budding pirate to be. Giggles. I actually bought this for my Husband as a stocking stuffer. He loves all the pirate movies with Jack Sparrow. I thought it cute, and then we could display them on the bookshelf after. Great for many. Telescope does work in bringing objects closer. I tested it. Happy Holidays to all."
"Much lovelier when put on than any picture can portray. I Highly recommend this lovely shade for the holidays. Even nice for the summer. Great addition to all women to use. Lovely"
"I took this on a cruise i went on, that Halloween fell on one of the days at sea. Wore a cute black skirt and top, and went as a belly dancer/Egyptian. You use your imagination and there could be many more uses for this. Great quality. NOT CHEAPLY made. I plan on using it in the future as surprising hubby night, all dressed up for anniversary gift. LoL. HIGHLY Recommend for so many uses. Role play? great for that too."
"sorry to say. I wasted my time on this pest control book. there. was little information on what to use to rid what pests. well. best to all.I was looking for information on how to rid the home of ants, mice and other common pests. guess I came to the wrong book."
"I gave this book three stars because the story was ok, but it was not very exciting. At times it was hard to follow the writers style of writing. Reading it gave me something to do on a four hour flight."
"Over the past year I have purchased different pillows, trying to get a good nights sleep. I finally found it with the Dream Supreme pillow. It is perfect, and I am finally able to sleep soundly through the night."
"Very easy to put together, sturdy, and I would highly recommend this product to anybody!"
"Gets my brain working every time. My boyfriend and I play this every night. It's cool to see which logos I know and ones he doesn't."
"I just got the product in the mail yesterday and  immediately put it to use. I have a pair of high heel shoes that are just too snug by the toes and this overnight in one shoe has made a difference!"
"Not the best but okay to pass time. It should understand how your partner plays. It should have a better understanding of the game play."

"Great APP! this a pretty good app for finding just about everything you might need. it is a pretty convenient app."
"I bought this book in order to study for my residency exam, it is almost enterely based on the American Academy of Ophthalmology Basic and Clinical Science Course. I love it, gives you key facts that you must know."
"Ordered a set of dumbbells (yes, plural, that's what the product page says)  only to find out that it contains only 1 handle (after re-reading the product page it actually says &amp;#34;contains one handles&amp;#34;. Why would I buy a 60 pounds set of dumbbells only to use 1 handle ?  Read product page  carefully before committing."
"I very much like its intuitiveness.  It senses which of my three pieces of hardware is at work, and brings those signals to my TV."
"This book sounded like a real person. Was not too descriptive considering the title but was by no means dry!"
"Basically what I said in the title. You can make some shots with the same motion three times in a row. But on the next set it goes way wide on a simple passing shot. But it doesn't ruin the game. Good graphics. Good gameplay"
"My child love them she carry them every were she go she changes  the face every day she try to bring them to school she lot e them the sound is so perfect"
"I love these boots so much in brown, I just ordered the black ones too!!April Marie in Minnesota, USA"
"I truly love John Grisham's novels and would have given Summons a 4 up until the ending. I turned the page ready to continue and realized that the previous page was the end of the book. I chose the book because it had some of the same cast of characters and setting as A Time To Kill, Sycamore Row and The Last Juror, which were excellent. This book just didn't cut it."
"The book is entertaining,as  are all of James Patterson's mysteries. It is more along the lines of the Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drew series. I would probably have given it 5 stars back when I was a kid and reading murder mysteries. It is great for kids."
"This was better than expected, kids love singing to the music on the cd's some of them they don't know but I do"
"product just like expected, loved it purchased for a person in office its hard to find copy holder more horizontal than vertical"
"would recommend this to everyone wanting to see what they shoot, excellent price for what you get scope is well worth more than what I paid"
"the first one  was good, but in this one, I even cried, that alot coming from me. i am very cold in the romantic kind of stuff but this book definitely got me."
"too short. and the main character (the girl) is too vulnerable. I don't like that kind of personalities. he is too selfish"
"The cost of hints should be less. And the Facebook app for you to ask your friends for help only works when you have enough coins. That's lame!!!!"
"great cut, almost perfect, no bubble issues at all.  easy to install, if you can use some water it will be a lot easier."
"works great with folder case... in order go have full nexus protection with the folder case.. buy this and use 2 cases.. because all the fold cases does not cover the corners... with this you are fully protected."
"perfect and easy to install! i would buy more if i have to! thanks!.  easy easy easy  to install...try it"
"I bought these mostly just to keep the wood grips that the R1 came with looking good, but the Hogue grips are very nice and fit this handgun perfectly.  I would highly recommend for the Remington R1, especially for the price."
"Has worked as designed no issues.  Have used twice in some situations that put a good load on the product and have seen no sign of it wanting to come apart.  I am Happy"
"I love this series and strongly recommend reading all three! My nephew is now hooked on this series too! I like it equally as well as the Harry Potter books."
"I would like it better had I received the hardware for all three stools. I have to wait 4-6 weeks to complete the set. I hope the hardware is sent as promised."
"I would love to rate this a 5 star everything is amazing but the volume goes up and down. So now I am going to have to go through the trouble of getting it fixed!"
"Excellent product..... excellent sound.... excellent performance.... I recomend this product because it has fully my expectative. !!! ))) !!!! ((("
"Its a good Watch specially for its Price but Its a little big and It has a few electronic options. The watch achieve my basic requirements."
"I love this CD because I so love Christmas music and especially Celtic Christmas Music.  These songs are particularly beautiful."
"This is a great item to accelerate your workout program.  It is light weight and easy to take anywhere.  They come in different colors which represent various levels of resistance.  I purchased the blue, red and purple bands and use them accordingly.  Like another reviewer mentioned, use the door mount on the hinge side of the door only and then close to the hinge itself.  Otherwise, you might get a rude slap (as I did) when the pressure exerted by pulling on the bands expanded the door just enough to let the anchor slip through and hit me on the chest.  Lesson learned.  Never had that problem again and they work wonderfully.  I use mine with the 10 minute upper body workout and they are great.  I highly recommend using this to turn your room into a great upper body exercise space.Weight Loss Platinum Hypnosis Program"
"Fantastic series full of wonderful characters, thoughtful situations and both light-hearted and touching moments. The series started strong unlike others that take time to develop.  This is in no small way due to the great acting and scripts.  Highly recommend all the seasons.  The final season that introduced new characters was also fascinating and enjoyable."
"I received this item as a gift from my wishlist and Love It! The item has alot of stretch which makes it flattering for any size and is priced right! This is my new favorite outfit for when I want to feel sexy!"
"I received this item as a gift and it is great! It fits great, is super sexy and the price is so right! The item also arrived sooner than expected which always makes me happy! I have received items from this seller before and I am always pleased with the products."
"Perfect fit for my Nikon SB600 and great price. Love the results and find myself using it more and more."
"Gates belts are an excellent quality belt. Bought them for my goldwing and fit was excellent. Good by and good luck."
"Strong well built tool, should last as long a long time, More reach then the usual angled pliers, very handy"
"Ordered 2 of these bags as I had used them before while deployed.  Both were purchased used and shipped to me overseas.  Both were shipped in heavy duty plastic vacuum sealed bags.  After unpacking they were as described, nearly new. No stains, rips, tears, smelled fresh and appeared to be brand new.  Extremely happy with the purchase and vendor service.  Would highly recommend to friends."
"Arrived on time and it fits everything I need it for. Super cute &amp; fashionable. Definitely would recommend this bag to someone else"
"First thing you should know is that I'm one of the biggest skeptics out there. &amp;#34;HANDS DOWN&amp;#34;.. lol.. However, this product is absolutely positively amazing. A friend suggested it to me because of my chronic back pain, and the numbing and tingleness from a near fatal car accident i had back in 2010.  one month later, I decided to try it.. First thing I noticed is that my skin started clearing up from severe acne,(stress related) my face became brighter more even tone, and the glow is irresistable. Everyone started asking me did I start working out, I said no, with a puzzled look on my face.. Then I realized, it's the AminoSculpt that gave me the muscles without the gym... BONUS!!!!  In closing, it also aides me with falling asleep at bed time instead of all the meds they have me on for pain and sleep.. The only bad thing is, I'm not able to purchase it as often as I should. I'm off then on.. . But overall, it's a great product and I recommend it to my friends and family especially the ones with health issues.. I hope this helps someone out there.God Bless"
"The bag is another tough and durable equipment  made by the Rothco company for the office or the classroom.  You'll like it."
"For fans of Nausiccia, Princess Monoke and Spirited Away, this a treasure trove of music from the comproser.  A great buy for a OOP and very rare,...if you can find it,...CD.  Highly recommended."
"For those wanting the best of World Music, this CD and embedded video is a Must Buy.  Try it,...you will not be disappointed."
"Although I bought this holster believing that it would fit my HTC ONE, it's too large; however; it fits my son's SamSung S4 perfectly.  It's a great price for an excellently constructed and convenient holster.  I bought the RGQX601 XL Super heavy Duty which fit my HTC ONE perfectly."
"Sometimes it dribbles a little water, but otherwise I love this product. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, but it ended up also being a gift to myself. I use it all the time when I need to quickly rid my clothes of wrinkles before work or going out. It heats up super quickly and really gets the job done.I've found it works best when I lay my clothes flat on a bed and use it like an iron."
"yes a good shovel for pushing more than throwing but over all a good buy pleased with it used it already"
"the f fret is hard to hold and the rest of the things are alright there were no return slip"
"it was a little smaller than normal mediums but it stil fit. i wear a small in real life but on amazon i always order a medium because most items do come too small."
"I suffered a Severe Traumatic Brain Injury in 1997 and was in a coma for almost two weeks.  They saw the damage in the frontal lobe of my brain, but I think something else was injured (like my pituitary).  I saw a nutritionist and she started me on this.  I prefer natural remedies to drugs even though I have to use both.  This is just one of the three things she had me on from metagenics.  Together they seem to help my mood and my hormones and regulate my cycle more.  Now I am on disability and have a very difficult time affording these products.  They are priced high because they work.  I'm not sure this can help anyone else as my situation is the result of a severe brain injury....Love the product, but keep praying for the price to go lower for me.... Kerry"
"No different than the ones a 3ds comes with, other than the color on the ends. They stretch out to the same length and fit nicely inside the console's socket."
"I love it because I think my mini iPad  know is more protected. Know my family want to buy it too."
"First tried this item at a hotel. I received compliments on my hair. It also has a nice long cord.  I got one for myself and gave one as a give."
"This item got sent to me quick and it worked perfectly in my ford truck radio. I very happy with it."
"This battery is fake it would not hold a charge! It swelled up and would fit in my Note anymore! This is a piece of crap!!! Don't buy this!!!!!!"
"They would not stick with any glue this was a total waste of money! Hate these tips! Do not order them!"
"I love my makeup box the colors are amazing. I love the print! I love print,but if you have a lot of makeup you might want to get a bigger box."
"With these lashes you do get what you pay for! THEY DONT STICK ULESS YOU USE A LOT OF GLUE! They took a month to come and the box was damaged when I got them the lashes don't lay right I hate this product!"
"these earrings are way smaller then what the picture makes them look like! I hate small earrings!!!!!!!! I sent mine back for a refund!"
"Picture makes these earrings look big but they are really small. I hate small earrings. I was so mad to see how small they were."
"I tried local auto parts stores with no luck. I replaced my auto antenna which is mounted on the rear fender. There was no way I wanted route the current cable and this adapter allows you to connect the antenna to the existing cable."
"My kids are going to love these almost everyone at their school has one! I got my son and daughter both one and finally I have enough words to submit this review. FINALLY!"
"These are great glasses and Oakley has a fine product but I would definitely spend the extra to get the polarized lens, they make a big difference when it comes to the sun.Overall I'm very satisfied with the product and the price."
"It's not a bad case for the price but it has the look more of a binder than a tablet case, oh and the card holders on the otherside will fit a business card and not a drivers license or credit card."
"The case is great and stands right next to the otterboxes, the only thing is that it is quite a task getting it on but for protection it shouldn't just clip on. 10 in my book"
"It's a great smell and for the price, the smell has a masculine smell like maybe armani code but a bit lighter. It's a good smell but in my opinion mont Blanc should stick to making expensive pens, 10x the amount of the cologne they make."
"As long as its under 40$ it's a good deal and a overall warm and appealing fleece, would by again, in a different color but not for anymore than 40.00$"
"Chrome Dreams is the 1977 unreleased album by Neil Young. The CD features a large amount of still-unreleased material.The version of ""Powderfinger"" is the original acoustic version.

"After reading this book, I felt empowered! Reading one heart wrenching journey after another made me realize that even in our darkest hours, our family isn't alone in the fight to recover our daughter from the group of illnesses they diagnosed as autism. This book should not only be required reading for anyone who loves a child or adult with autism, but someone who is pregnant or planning on starting a family. NOONE is buying the better diagnosis excuse that the CDC keeps trying to sell. Our children with autism are medically sick and they can get better with the right interventions!"
"I love this tree, it was easy to put up as a test and I will be looking forward to seeing it decorated for Christmas!  I love it."
"This 2 pounds of chocolate was sent to me in a box about an inch bigger then the chocolate with no packing to keep it from melting , so needless to say I have 2 pounds of a brick of melted chocolate in the refridgerator.  I suppose I could slice it up but it was a gift."
"I had other faux wooden blinds up before these for years until they broke and I needed to replace them.  These have no image of wood on them and they look like smooth cheap plastic also I couldn't tell by the picture even enlarged that there was no wand to open and close them.  I don't care for all the string pulls."
"These are the only fasteners that actually hold large amount of paper on files, the ""brass plated"" fasteners just bend and everything falls out."
"Bought it for a camping trip, it worked perfect and did lat 5 hours before I had to charge it.,  Would I recommend this, you bet."
"This product was great for my thick curly dry frizzy hair would recommend to anyone will buy product again go t mine complimentary from influenster #paradisevoxbox"
"Husband loves this! You definitely have to build up to it but you get a great forearm workout out of this. Smart buy."
"I was a big fan of Power Rangers in the late 90s-early 00s, and I never had the original MMPR Megazord. Thankfully, this rerelease fills that void. Although not a perfect recreation of the 90s toy, it still has a vintage feel. Parts are of high-quality plastic and diecast. My only complaint is the sticker sheet. The actual stickers are placed about a half-inch to the right of the patterns (most likely a manufacturing error, and hopefully an isolated incident). Overall, this is a must-have for fans of the show from way back when!"
"I would have loved the product pictured but that is not what I received. Please send me the product pictured which is the product I paid for."
"I bought 2 of those books and they are awesome but they were stick together with a big sticker and I haven't succeed to take it away completely without damaging the cover of the product."
"When I received the Anker Astro3E it was fully charged because all the LED lights came up but when I began to charged it with the computer the Anker 3E is charging but it is to SLOOOW. I've been charging it for like 24hrs now. Some of the people claim it can charged up to 8 hours in computer."
"The shoe looks great, feels quite comfy but could be because it is quite large. I am a true size 7, and my heels slip when I walk. I have just put on gel heel grips yet my feet are popping out. Such a shame! Otherwise a good looking shoe!!"
"This was the best book I have read in a long time.  It was definitely filled with a lot of sex scenes some more detailed than others - but they were all great.  I really liked Rich, Vanessa, and Candy's relationship.  It was a little to Unbelievable at times...but that's what fiction is!  I loved it and can't wait for part two to arrive..."
"Only order our paper from this company. Not only is the paper of good quality and inexpensive, but the turn around time is just a couple days. (Very helpful when estimators don't mention that paper is low, only when it's gone.)"
"Amazon prime offers this video for free for viewing on PC and I have been wanting to get in shape so I took advantage of the free aspect of it!I am NOT in shape, a good 100+ pounds overweight, I dont go on walks, I dont do anything to get me moving through the day so I was scared to start in on Jillian but I am glad I did. This is great for beginners. There were some things I couldn't do, but I just kept moving with some of the warm ups/easier exercises while they did the ones I couldn't do. I got through 17 minutes before I had to call it quits, which may not be great for those experienced in working out, but for the first time working out since gym in high school, I felt AWESOME and felt very accomplished getting through nearly half of it! I cant wait to see how long I can go tomorrow!"
"When you buy the larger sized pants, you can expect the legs to be as wide as the thighs. My legs are much thinner than my thighs, and it makes the legs look very baggy. Doesn't matter though, a needle and thread can fix that."
"No matter what you think it is worth buying this mouse just to look at it. I love the mouse, and playing games like League of Legends is much easier with it."
"I have this book on my Android.  It is easier to carry with me wherever I go. Not only that,  it is easier to see.  This author is great.  He has written on a number of fantastic Christian topics from the Bible.  Anyone who loves history will love this book.  It will really stir up a hunger for more information on Biblical times."
"Came really fast. looks never use. in a original box, My mother is going to freak , she has been waiting one forever.. Use BUT looks like new!! Thanks"
"One day i saw my friends playing it and then a got the game its a dick-ting at first then it gets boring.It's a good game to play when your bored other than that its ok."
"I have been using a small cross over sling purse for over 8 yrs and it still looks the same..Very practical with little babies around."
"The book was all I had hoped for.  I worked in healthcare for twenty nine years, twenty in Medicare billing and nine in Medicaid billing, and in my job I had to read the Medicare bulletins which were many times difficult to understand.  I read the ACA bill three times and was devastated at what I did understand.  Betsy was able to take the bill apart and explain, in layman's terms, what it actually means.  I am giving them to family and friends so they can see what is coming.  The President and the democrats have lied about this bill for a long time but it is now catching up to them.  They won the election with lies and now everyone knows it.  Thanks Betsy for an informative, truthful, easy to comprehend explanation of the &amp;#34;Unaffordable Care Act&amp;#34;."
"I recommend this book for everybody! It's worth to read itIt's no easy learn another language, but either impossible one just need discipline, commitment, and value to go ahead and get it.The Second Edition is very good. I am glad to have read the Second Edition, because I was going to invest more money in the academy, but I realized that I need more practice with my English. I need a job where I have to speak English,  and a Social English Circle to improve it. No more grammar nor boring books. I need to speak a lot to get more confidence and pass to another level.Thank You Daniel!"
"I am so happy with this story, it is fantastic, creative and it's not predictable. I liked how the writer developed the story and described the all details. It was very interesting that up to I felt scared when I was reading the book! Nobody does that! Awesome. Congratulations Mr Nicholas you are the best!."
"I'm very disappointed with the purchase.Absolutely doesn't fit to ANY item we have. Wouldn't recommend it to any one."
"Pros: Does what it's made for. Protects the the phone from drops,dirt,car oil, ect. Adds thickness to the phone so that you can hold it better. Does not fall out of your pocket.Cons: Flash on can cause a green hue in pictures during the day (if flash is on), an at night you cant take any pictures without green over coming the whole picture.Should you get it: It's up to you, because it may or may not happen to you. If do get this type of case get the all black one."
"I chose this rating because it was the highest the site allowed. This book was the first that I have read by this author, but it will not be the last. I completed the entire book in less than an hour and a half. I couldn't put it down."
"The excitement of a spy show, mixed with the comedy of friends that have all the wrong connections, family, and a girlfriend that uses the black market to blow stuff up....recipe for success."
"I recently purchased a head unit for my car, and was excited to get a stereo back into it, as I had not had a car for about 5 years while I was in college, and really missed the years of owning car and having a nice stereo with a sub. It was like my rolling sanctuary, and I wanted that back. I ended up getting a 12"" L5 solobaric sub, based on the praise it got, and the apparent hype surrounding it. The price of the sub fooled me into thinking that it MUST be good. I thought I lucked out getting the sub and a custom ported box for $200.00 on craigslist. The box was huge and built very well. I hooked it up to the cheapo 1200 watt Sound Xtreme amp I had laying around, and was immediatley dissapointed. The bass was just not at all what I was hoping it would be, or would be able to tolerate very long. It was incredibly boomy. It missed many notes in my rock music, as well as a solid portion of my hip hop. For my bassnectar and similar music it rocked. It absolutely pounded. But in the end, it was really only great with that 1 type of music. Playing with the amp and adjusting the gain was pointless, as even on very low settings, it was just wayy too much.  The bass was much too loud for various songs. Some songs sounded fine, some sounded like crud, and some just sounded OFF, wayy to much bass at wrong times, and the sub was unable to fully reproduce all of the different frequencies my music required of it. I did much research over the next few days. Trying to determine how I could get the sound I was after. I read lots of different opinions, wildly different from the next. The worst part was that the people advising all seemed fairly credible, and trustworthy. Yet they all offered different advice, none of which panned out. In the end, I listened to my gut, and decided to purchase a new sub. This time, a round 12"", or possibly a 10"", and also this time, a sealed box. Ported boxes just don't cut it for me. They don't deliver that tight accurate bass that I absolutely crave.I spent about 1.5 weeks scouring the web, reading, comparing prices, listening to advice. I decided in the end that I would suck it up, and buy something that pretty much guaranteed me the results I was after. A JL audio 12"" sub, (12w3 or better) and a sealed box. I was just about to order those 2 things, for the price of about 230.00 after shipping. While I was adding the item to my cart, checking one last time that I had the right sub with the right specs, I accidently clicked a link for the Infinity 1262w. I immeditley realized I had totally forgotten about this company. And I reminisced about my first sub, a 10"" infinity, and how lovely it sounded, and how long it lasted. I saw the price was only $65.00 so immeditley I assumed this was low end gear, and that maybe this was infinity's budget line, on par with the likes of Sony, or Walmart Pioneer subs. Just for giggles,  I decided to check out the reviews, and see what people thought... at 4.5 stars, they must have been pleased. What I found shocked me. The reviews were so overwhelmingly positive, so I set out to find any and all discussion or literature about this sub. Each thing I found was better than the last. Outrageous claims about this sub blowing away top end $200.00 - $400.00 subs. On a handful of occasions, people compared this sub to the JL 10w7,time after time they seemed to favor the 1262w. Instead of being called out as being full of it, they were consistently backed up, and multiple people genuinely agreed. I simply couldn't believe it.I had free 2 day shipping, and 40 bucks in amazon credit, so I said what the heck, and decided to take the chance. I picked up this sub and the reccomended 1.25 cu foot scosche box for $95.00 shipped 2 day air. I hooked this sub up to my same cheapo amp, and wired it to use both voice coils, and I believe it is running @ 2 ohm. IT SLAMS. All music. Any genre. It sounds so amazing, I am absolutely stunned. It gave me exactly what I wanted, and also manged to give me even more than I was hoping for.TL;DR - Just because this sub is $65.00 does not mean it has sacrificed quality for the sake of affordability. Somehow, infinity manages to consistently put out extremely high quality products, and a cost that is not just affordable, but almost discouragingly cheap. I don't get it. I don't know how they do it. I don't understand how there is sooo much crap out there... Countless brands who have become irrelevant over the years for following the same path. The path to Walmart. Sacrificing quality every time in order to be cheap enough to sell mass quantities. Well, let me assure you, Infinity does not have the same problem, and seems to be the only company in the entire Car Audio game that will not succumb to that fate. Long Live Infinity!!"
"fits my phone really well and easy to apply too. I really like it and it was a great product for the price. Way cheaper then I would have paid at a store."
"i am very hard on phones. i have cracked screens, broken backlights, and demolished other &amp;#34;protective&amp;#34; cases.yes, this makes my phone much bulkier, but that is not an issue for me.it is protected, and that is what i needed!"
"Absolutely fantastic. Should make every one stop and pray for salvation.  I don't want to be left behind. Thank you JESUS FOR SAVING MY LIFE."
"My son wanted to put in a new 'front end' (am/fm cd player) in one of our family cars that he drives back &amp; forth to school.  This wiring adapter and google allowed us to do the change out with ease."
"This book is fantastic! Great recipes and very informative. I lost 15lbs so far and I am feeling healthier, my skin is clear and my sleep patterns have improved tremendously."
"Excellent product very fine HP Original Battery - 593554-001 - MU06. Muy buen producto aunque llego algo tarde por el correo, ya me estaba preocupando."
"Love this on my desk, beautiful pictures and lots of room for writing down appts or whatever you need to remember."
"i used to own this game a few years back, but it was stolen along with my Wii and other GC and Wii games. having my favorite zelda game back is a great feeling."
"I bought this game because I always like to play with my friends, and this was the right game. The cage and disc just like new, I loved it!"
"The game was in perfect conditions, just like new, I really really like it. The only thing is that I only got the case and the disk..."
"It took a while to arrive and stuck some links but it's a nice bracelet! thinner than the photo! It looks great with a good watch!"
"This cube is just amazing. It takes time to solve it thou. If you are looking for something more challenging that the 3x3, this is your cube!"
"This dlc makes your really long game, longer, new weapons, armors, enemies, new lands. This is the best dlc for skyrim, really excited about it!"
"I love the app but when I download a picture an add thing pops up so I hit the back button and it takes me all the way to the begging of the pictures even when I was half way through"
"I got these gloves primarily because I'm on the computer a lot and I live in the mountains. They are a tight knit so they do keep you warm; the quality of the sewing is high. The buttons are also solidly sewed on. They are very comfortable and pretty -- I've gotten a few compliments on them. Overall, I'd buy another pair just to have a variety of colors."
"I bought this for my boyfriend for Halloween, and it was the best decision I've ever made. First, it is big enough to fit any size head. My boyfriend has a large head, and it's a comfortable fit. Second, it's textured so it looks real. Third, he's a unicorn. Need I say more?"
"I honestly loved this book i wonder how many more books James Patterson can make. I just really wish i had money to buy all of his books!!!!!!!!!!"
"I defending champion of the year old son of the God I just love this book is a wonderful thing to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I gave this book a five star because it was funny and I'm an 12 year old an 12 year olds really love all that drama and I hope James Patterson can really make billions of book that are appropriate for kids and I love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"It was the usual Belinda Alexandra, I cant put down book. I had to keep reading to see what happened next. I have read all her novels released here and can't wait for the next. My favourite was Golden Earrings."
"I have received my third copy of HGTV and I love it! It shows makeovers, painting techniques and furniture ideas. I read it from cover to cover the same day that I receive it. I then read it over and over again for anything that I might have missed the first few times. I was getting so tired of the monthly magazines I had been getting for years and this is just such a fresh magazine. Good job people at HGTV."
"I have only had mine a week but getting plenty of questions, and best of all is the price.A quality watch that also looks the part.  This gives some of my TAG's a run for their money in the show stakes.If your thinking of buying one you wont be disappointed.Oh, doing up the band is surely an IQ test, eventually I passed though.Cheers"
"This case is exactly as described and what I was looking for.  It is made of solid wood, has a glass viewing window, and a solid lock and key.  I would recommend this case to anyone who wats to display or store their watches."
"This book radically changed my approach and understanding to generosity. For myself, this has been one of the woefully neglected areas of my ministry. I was one of those guys described in the book who felt it was a mark of holiness for me not to know who gives and really be completed ignorant of what was going on financially. After reading the book, I simply looked at stewardship/generosity in a new light. I am taking my leadership through the book and will be making sure that the concepts and principles therein will find their way throughout the church."
"Searcy's book, &amp;#34;Connect&amp;#34; is a good book and I really enjoyed it, for the simple reason it enabled me to start thinking through how to create and implement systems in our church. What I like about it is that its very practical. While not everything translates to our context, I always make sure I look for principles of connection not programs. And very often with Searcy, what you see is simply common sense put to print helping us remove much of the fear of recruiting and implementing volunteers."
"Good product, quick delivery &amp; reasonably priced!  I have nine cats so I needed something reasonably priced.  They are indoor/outdoor cats and we do feed two strays.  This product has kept the fleas off of our cats."
"Be careful with these pants, they DO NOT follow amazons sizing chart. If you order a large you will not get a 30 - 32 waist, you will get a 40 waist."
"Fits good, and feels very durable. No itching or discomfort. Also does give a degree of protection from wind and water, not as much as a real deal uniform, but enough for civy use."
"After having these for a few months, i have bad news to report. The first couple of prints from these cartridges were fine, but after a couple of months of inactivity, these cartridges will now only print blank pages. It has something to do with the ink sensor inside the cartridge. After much research, i have concluded that cheaply refilled dell series 2 ink cartridges are not making proper contact with the Encoder Band inside the printer, which is responsible for squirting the ink out of the cartridge onto the paper. I have also seen news that ALL dell series 2 cartridge ink sensors CANNOT be reset after they are used, therefore in theory, all refilled dell series 2 cartridges will have problems. I also have two black cartridges that i bought from Abacus that i put in just to see, and after a couple of weeks they are both working fine. Maybe theres something Abacus is doing that Enviroinks is not. I cannot guarantee that all cartridges are like this, but all should be weary."
"These are very nice socks for warm weather, they breathe very well and my feet are always dry and cool when i pull them out of the boots, but for cold weather, they dont really work that well due to their design. They have an extra band in the middle of them that makes them fit tightly to the foot, wich means less warm air trapped inside the sock. The side effect of this extra band is that it is very hard for this sock to come off inside your shoe/boot, wich i usually have problems with, especially when running in boots. These have yet to come off. I would recommend these to everyone looking for a good warm weather running/working/general comfort sock."
"This is a poorly made splitter. After some light use, the black casing will slide off exposing the insides, and no matter what, if you use multiple devices at once, one of them will get distorted sound, as if there's a short somewhere. The ports are too close together, which means any cords that you plug in must be low profile like this device. And lastly, the 3 sectioned jack doesn't like to work right on some devices, like phones and mp3 players, and older devices from back in the day.The only pros i can think of is the low profile design, abnormally strong and sturdy cable, and sleek look. Other than that it kinda sucks."
"After a winter of use, i can say that these are great gloves. They definitely keep the hands warm and protected, and allow good movement of the fingers for working. Would highly recommend."
"This may be the greatest external hard drive case ive owned. And ive owned a few. It fits very well in the pocket and is smooth on the outside. The cable that comes with it is big and fat too witch is good for stress/tension. The case is also very well designed, both sides pop off at the touch of a button, although you will need some good thumbnails to press the button all the way down. Then you can take any 2.5' Hard Drive and slide it in, pop the two sides back on and your ready to go.The only con i can think of, is what makes this design work. The SATA connector is a bit flimsy, and feels like it can be broken off, but it has to be like this so it can move at an angle to connect to the hard drive when you slide it in. If it wasn't flimsy, you would break it before you got a hard drive in it. So as a precaution, be careful when you insert or remove a hard drive."
"I would like to say Thank you but I NEVER RECEIVED THE MEMORY I JUST OPEN THE BOX I FIND ONLY THE CAMARA &amp; BACK PACK if I dont write before is because I was away so I come back last night then I opened the box I find only 2 thinghs so I would like to know what happen now"
"this game was one of my first games on a pc and  i loved it! when I saw that it was only $2 to download I didn't even think about it but just clicked Buy!!and it's still an awesome game!! it works perfect and playing it has brought back so many great memories!"
"I looked for this product on the officla Tony website and It was three times as much!Bought it instantly. Great taste!The shipping took 3 days longer."
"so far so good.Nice mat. looks like good quality.made of coconut fibers with I guess is a good thing.Can't say something about the lifetime. Only had it for a week now. I'm using it indoors so I guess that should increase the lifetime."
"It came in a nice wrapped package, like new. There were adhesives I could use to stick it in place. It worked perfectly when I tried it out with my Animal Crossing Wii game."
"Very easy to use. Cleans very well. Othwt steam cleaners I have used emit so much steam it lifted my tile. This one has just the right amount of steam!"
"I love my wireless yurbuds. They are great and almost better than my old wired set. A must for runners."
"first thing that happened as soon as i removed it from the wrapping, the two end beads fell off, this happened before i even wore the bracelet itself. it shipped late, and the bracelet itself is  very cheaply made. beware of lower priced items!!"
"I was very excited to receive my dotting tool, It is a easy and a versatile tool to use and have at your finger tips, There are so many designs you can create with this, excellent for drawing dots, flowers, etc, This dotting tool is great when you have a hard time dotting,very convenient how it's double sided with a smaller dot, good price, and  arrived in excellent condition, highly recommend."
"I recommend this book to anyone! Amazing true story of faith. So sad but I love it. Read it today!"
"Loved this book!  A great read for anyone who has ever asked the age old question, &amp;#34;What is life all about?&amp;#34;Connecting his own personal experiences with detailed research, David Gaggin writes thoughtfully about his search for the truth and invites the reader to do the same.  Interesting and unique perspectives on spirituality and this journey we call life-  I would recommend to anyone who is open minded and curious about their connection to others and to the universe."
"Purchase the Jabra wave headset because of the price.  The headset is very clear and fit my ear great. I am able to hear the person on the other end very clear."
"winter is wonderful after this shoes when you put on you you feel wonderful you feel like get in a car"
"Belt is very nice and durable.thats the good. the bad the &amp;#34;screwdriver &amp;#34; is a half inch very thin piece of metal that can't be used. And fishing kit is cheep."
"All right excellent, in very good condition and very fast great price for four disk, and 3D is espetacular.I will keep buying movies in 3D."
"It's a Great product, fast charge time, lasts a good amount of time. I am satisfied =) Would recommend to others!"
"I have an android phone and the battery dies fast. This is useful when I'm not at home and the size is perfect for charging. I am definitely satisfied! =)"
"Great quality decal. I wish that it was less frustrating to pull apart and get the decal on the clear side but other than that it serves it's purpose."
"I've started using it for just a few weeks and starting feeling that.my knee is getting better. Hope it gets even better."
"The screen protector sucks when i got in in the mail it had marks all over it and the back one doesn't even fit the back."
"I would reccomend this product to anyone with an I phone for protection. The otter box is by far the best product I have seen. And why would you pay 50 dollars at best buy when on amazon with shipping is only 20"
"I needed a laptop for work. I got an iPad for a good price,  but I was worried about the typing. I found this CHEAP keyboard and it is everything I needed. My mom even ordered her one the day I got mine!"
"Good case. Loop tie keeps it attached to stuff we take to rehab center. Easy to use and easy to find in our bag."
"After borrowing this book and also iPhone for Dummies from our local library, I determined that Teach Yourself Visually was more user-friendly and easier to understand.  This is my first experience with a smart phone so I really needed the information this book provides and so far, it has answered all my questions."
"This is for my 14 year old granddaughter, who is just starting to experiment with make-up. The colors are super hot, and perfect, light colors for a beginner. I'm very pleased with all the items, and the train case was much higher quality than I expected."
"Exceeded my expectations! This is for my granddaughter, who does nails better than most pros(she's 12). I also got her the SHANY nail art set to go with it  I recommend this to anyone into pedi-manis!!!"
"I struggled with this book.  Chapters too long.  Didn't care for writers style.  Would not recommend.  Not what I expected."
"Fit great on my tablet love the purple color and it stands the tablet up I like it nice buy"
"Fit my tablet perfectly and was a good deal with fast shipping no squeegee included but I used a card so no biggie"
"Durable and great fun. Bought one for 10 yr old granddaughter and was so impressed bought one for 6yr old granddaughter"
"Baby didn't like bath time until he got these to play with now he has a great time in the tub!"
"I give it 5 stars because it is an amazing show. Yes it does get even better in the later seasons but this establishes the characters and the many plots to come. Not my very favorite season but this show is so good it still is great entertainment."
"Obviously an awesome show. I adore it. Amazon let me download it quickly and hassle free but the quality isn't the greatest. It isn't bad though."
"I wish there was more to it then the cover photos, but it was anyways. I think that it was good expat for what I pointed out."
"I really enjoyed the book, it was hard for me to believe that could really happen.  But, what if it could?  God can do all things.  It is just hard to wrap my mind around, but it is great reading."
"I love this notepad App it's so cool. Plus you can set your own password so only you can go on there"
"This book was well written and a pleasure to read.  I think all readers would gain insight from the very honest characters."
"My boys love Richard Scarry. They have many of his books and several of his videos. This one is meh. Not terrible, but certainly not the best out there. I would recommend sticking to his &amp;#34;Best Ever&amp;#34; series."
"This replaces a broken or lost belt for the kenmore upright vacuum. It was economical and priced fairly. What more can you ask for?"
"This is a great show for kids to watch. Sometimes I find myself or my husband getting pulled in because it is so informative and entertaining. This  has my 3 year old spouting off facts like, &amp;#34;a polar bear is a top predator in the Artic&amp;#34;  and, &amp;#34; bats are nocturnal,&amp;#34;"
"the new printer did not seem to like my computer am trying to sort it out .with help from an expert."
"This item was truly worth I mean it you save 12,000 Dollar! That's enough to buy like 300 puppies 300! Totally worth It"
"Excellent. Very insightful. I hope this book is read far and wide.Such a sad reality that this level of evil exists in the world, yet this book brings great understanding to it all."
"She loved it and started making a Bucket List right away!Great gift for someone who likes to plan for the future."
"It's been well over a month and I haven't gotten what I paid for. I reached out to them to see what was  going on n they weren't helpful at all. I would never order from them again. It's the 2nd time with these overseas dealers  it's really frustrating"
"works well...does have a slight unusual smell and a bit oily, but works well and will keep it for that! only 2 weeks  used on my thin hair-- hope to see some changes"
"Happy i tried and use this product, works well, user freindly..smells OK and will continue to purchase-use it ! again.."
"Nice to know, you have the protection-service to replace/repair your hard earned money on your purchases (electronics) glad i have it!"
"All worth the cost/price for this amplified speaker ( as so many to choose from..) i went with this model/type to fit my budget and not waste my money, well.. it was a good choice.. user frendly-Loud enough for my use.. (classroom) and backyard (gatherings) i plug and play my CD player and mic-up to have some fun..."
"very satisfied with purchase and delivery time, looks good- works as expected and love the shrink wrap/ covered handles. Busts a good sweat/workout for entire body."
"i used as directed- have no great improvement from use of my first and only bottle. I am not sure if i would try this again.."
"This book really simplifies decision making, it pretty much helps you decide when you want to implement an ""improvement"" if it would really help or if it wont."
"These 25 foot cables work really good, the sound quality is great with them. I got a couple of them. The price can't be beat. A 6 foot 3.5mm extender would be more to buy in a store than these 25 foot cables online."
"This 50ft CAT5e cable is great, especially for the low price of just $4.68!I'm using it to connect my surveillance camera DVR (which is hidden in a cabinet in the dining room) to my AT&amp;T; router/modem, and it's working perfectly. I ran it along the baseboard from the dining room to the living room (there isn't a wall dividing the dining room and living room in my house).I'm very glad I found this. The 50ft CAT5 cable at Walmart is around $30."
"I used these to connect extra 50ft cables to the 60ft cables that came with my Zmodo camera system. They work great. I didn't notice any quality loss either. It's better to buy them in packs of 10 like this rather than individually because although I don't need 10 of them, it's much cheaper to buy them like this (I paid just under $4 for these) and if I ever do need more someday I have extra ones."
"This is a great system, I really like it. Here's my review about it.Note: I didn't purchase this on Amazon but this is the exact system that I bought so I decided to write a review about it here.This system comes with the DVR, four cameras, four 60ft power+video siamese cables, a mouse, the power supply (power brick) for DVR, and a single power supply with a 4-way splitter for all of the cameras.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 1: The DVRThe DVR is great. It's nice and clean looking. The user interface looks crappy but I didn't pay much for it so I don't expect a pretty UI on it. It's also not that intuitive/user-friendly but I'm pretty familiar with it now . It was much easier than I thought it would be to install the hard drive. The screws on the DVR cover weren't even on it yet (they were in a bag with the hard drive screws) which made it easier to install the hard drive since I didn't have to unscrew each screw on the hard drive first. It came with the screws for the hard drive as well as the hard drive cover. I got a 500GB ""white label"" hard drive for $45 on another site and it's working great.The DVR has motion detection recording which is really nice. You can set it to continuously record or to only record when it detects motion. You can also set it up to send you an email when it detects motion and attach a picture of the motion it detected.- - - - - - - -EDIT: I have now successfully set up the networking stuff. It didn't take me too long, and I followed Zmodo's tutorial but I have experience with networking so it was pretty easy. You just have to open a few ports on your router. I can view my cameras anywhere on my iPhone as well as from any computer (that has Internet Explorer - ugh, I know... but it requires ActiveX to work). I couldn't get the email notification to work though - it just wouldn't work. I would've constantly been getting emails anyway though since the motion detection recording is triggered all the time.- - - - - - - -The DVR has 8 BNC video inputs, 2 BNC outputs, 4 RCA audio inputs, 2 USB inputs (one for mouse and one for flash drive to back up files), 1 ethernet input, 1 VGA output (for monitor), and the power input.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 2: The CamerasThis system comes with 4 cameras but the DVR is 8 channel so I have the ability to extend it if I need to add more cameras. The cameras were a little bigger than I expected them to be, but they're not too big. A couple years ago I got a couple of Lorex cameras from Radio Shack, and they're a bit smaller than these Zmodo cameras; I was expecting the Zmodo cameras to be as small as the Lorex ones. They do have more IR lights (night vision) on them though. The Lorex cameras that I previously had have microphones built in to them but the Zmodo cameras do NOT have microphones. I'm using the Lorex camera for the front door (so I have audio) but you can buy this small microphone to attach to one or more of the Zmodo security cameras for audio:VideoSecu High Sensitive Audio Pickup Device External Amplified Tiny Spy Microphone for CCTV Security Camera with Bonus Warning Decal WD6You'll have to purchase a cord that has the audio though too (they're available here on Amazon - 100ft video+audio+power cable for around $10).The cameras come with brackets and the mounting screws. It's kind of difficult to get it just right but I haven't had issues with the mounting brackets like others have had - they didn't break and I tightened it pretty good. Also, the camera colors are pretty accurate. I noticed some people have said that the camera colors aren't accurate but mine are pretty accurate.The night vision isn't that great, but it's better than just a black screen. You can see more than shadows but still not enough to identify someone. Lights that are outside your house make the night vision better though.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Overall, I am very happy with this system. I got a nice 8 channel DVR with 4 cameras for a great deal.PLEASE NOTE: This system does not come with a hard drive installed in the DVR, you have to buy it separately. You can still view the cameras without the hard drive but you won't be able to record anything without it."
"Not exactly what I expected but what I wanted.  It was introspective but was not a cutsie book about a dog and his person.  It was a nice read and I got a nice feel of climbing the White Mountains.  Some good family thoughtfulness.  I enjoyed it."
"Nice headphones, for $15 dollars these are pretty solid. Have a good 6-12 month life if you use them frequently. They fit comfortably, look good."
"Love this shirt, it fits perfect and its so cute!! I wish they had it in different colors because I would order two!"
"Exactly what I ordered. It is so cute and it got here just in time for a Valentines Day gift for my niece."
"My kids love this game so we had to buy it for every system. the only thing they dislike about it is they cant play online."
"Not messy and fun. Creates beautiful pictures. We used them in the coloring book and on construction paper to design our own pictures. It was perfect during a kindergarten play date too! The girls and 3 year old brother painted, shared, and had great conversation."
"I absolutely love the extra rich dark roast of this blend. It also makes a fabulous iced coffee great on hot days."
"These chairs are very comfortable and extremely well made. I would recommend these to anyone.You cant beat the price."
"THE HEADPHONES WERE EVERYTHING I HOPED THEY WOULD BE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN BUYING AN AID FOR HEARING YOUR TV MORE CLEARLY."
"This sub is grreat i just installed it the other day and i already love the thing. the aluminum box resonates the sound really well. there is a metalic ring after a big hit occasionally but it isn't a bad sound i actually kind of like it. the sub was extremely easy to hook up and get wired in, the only problem i ran into was getting passed my anti theft deck. The port on the front improves the clarity a lt and the design is kick ass this is deffinetly a good buy for the price. i just wish shipping was cheaper &gt;.&amp;lt;"
"Everything was great as far as fast service, price, etc. The only problem I had was that the color is mire maroon and not pink like in the picture. Wish I'd of known. My daughter loves pink so I hope she still likes this one."
"We've ordered pieces from Sauder before, but this was was really junky. We had to order replacement parts twice because they kept arriving all scratched up. Pieces are not packed well. After we built it, it looks like the shelves are way too small for the cabinet. There is all kinds of space on either side of the shelves.I'd avoid this."
"Boxes were shipped from manufacturer, not retailer. They were originally &amp;#34;placed on the wrong truck.&amp;#34; and were three weeks late arriving. When they arrived, there was a huge gash in the box. Only after taking the base out could we see that the gash cracked the back panel. The retailer we ordered through, Moshya, was very unhelpful. We really wanted the piece, so we kept it. We just have to be very careful of what we put under the seat. Blankets and jackets get snagged where the crack is.Otherwise, looks nice. I'd probably rate it higher if ours arrived on time and undamaged."
"Item came VERY quickly. 5/5 on delivery time, especially so close to Christmas using the free delivery! Item is in wonderful shape. No frays or discolorations. The pictures are all brilliantly colored and high detailed aside from the darker one, which is usually covered anyways so I can overlook it. Material is good quality for the price. If you're considering this product, I recommend it.Ignore the rating bit, I always rate accordingly and...for some reason it believes the wallet is a toy and therefore wants to know how educational and fun it is...both of which would be 1/5 &gt;_&gt;TL;DR :Great productGreat imageryHighly recommend."
"This app is fantastic, I have really enjoyed it! I use it mainly for sermons (t4g) but in all other areas it's great too"
"It works. But I felt like the product is a little bit hard when you try to connect the mini jack. But the most important thing is that works."
"I loved the story...the only thing I did not love about it was how they separated it into 6 volumns just to get you to pay 2.97 for what was just a book"
"Very touching! I can't wait to read more like this book. I Love family books about falling in love. Great book."
"Moves a little slow for advancement but over all a pretty good game, interesting to see what will come next. Can hardly wait to get to add a new section."
"As skimpy and nice this costume is, it is extremly hot! You wouldnt think that with a costume. The material sticks to you and creates alot of body heat. Normally I freaze my butt off in anything I wear so its not me. But overal it fits very nicely and skirt is not too short."
"It is smaller than I expected. And less durable. The knives are sharp but the light flickers on and off at times. Would not buy again."
"Loving the photos I am able to capture from this!!  Sharp, clear images with great color.  Wonderful purchase, I couldn't be happier."
"I have always wanted to get a rolled hemming foot, and when I saw that I could get all these for a great low price I decided to snatch them up."
"I downloaded this app and I couldn't get on the internet with this. This is not a good app. Don't get it."
"Awesome came very quick and in great condition! The keychain is very study for any occasion! I have it on my jeep keys fits well!"
"I ordered this using my prime and I couldn't be happier. All of the Part Stores around town wanted to charge double and have me wait for two days while they ordered it. I would purchase this product again."
"I have had a the same G100 for years, worn as a work watch in really dirty, rough and tumble industrial environment...at the end of the day just shower with it on, scrubb it down and the next day start all over again.  I have worn out several bands which I just replace and good as new.  I like the analog dial along with the easily viewable digital display, as well as the easily accessible stop watch mode, which I use reqularly... for the price... very impressed with the durability and accuracy of this watch, just wear it, use it, scrub it down at end of the day and your good to go again. I have found no issues with its ability to with stand substances within an industrial atmoshere...oils, fuel oil, grease of all types, dust, mud,  solvents, submerged in water, heat, hot and cold weather and never seen the vapor fogging under the bezel that I have seen on other watches in such extreme environments... the bezel glass is still perfect, not all scratched up and foggy, due mainly because it is protected by the high rubber bezel ring surrounding it...The only issue I would comment on is the cost of the replacement G Shock bands, little pricey for a $60 watch, but not as thought you have to replace them reqularly... maybe every few years at most..but definitly the only weak link in the system, IMHO"
"My husband and I don't normally order things on-line, but when I seen this Bible and the price, I knew I wanted it for our oldest son. I was surprised when we opened the package (which arrived way earlier than expected, another plus) that it was exactly how it was described on-line. We were certainly pleased with our order and will definitely order again."
"Works great! It's small and portable. I work outside all day so it's nice to have a backup for my phone."
"Hello. I bought this set in size 3T, but the blouse is size 24m. Too small.How can I do??Anali Febres"
"Hi guysIt worth more than I paid for very  nice and fit and comfortable I would buy more for around house for my sons"
"Purchased this as a place for my toddler to hang his things, and for that purpose it is perfect. However, I'd think twice before hanging anything too heavy on it. It's cute, and a great knockoff in comparison to it's higher-priced predecessor from Eames. My only real complaint is that the screws it came with are of extremely poor quality, and with one twist of the screwdriver, they stripped. Purchase yourself some decent hardware for hanging."
"This is a very informative slow cooker book. I learned many new things about this type of cooking. The recipes I tried were good. I do however wish that she included the oven version of some of the breads and deserts. They came out better from being cooked in the oven."
"Definitely has helped me understand the different oils and how to blend and heal. would definitely recommend this one! Thank you!!!"
"The way it's written is just beautiful. She brings you into these people's lives and makes you part of their journey. You will rejoice with their accomplishments and cry throughout their disappointments and heartbreaks. Not once did I lose interest in this book. I have taken the characters into my life and that is a show of a passionate writer. I thank you for the privilege of being invited to read this work of art. Can't wait to read the next book!!!!"
"this book is full of valuable information for any large breed dog, but especialy for greyhounds. If you are thinking of adopting a retired racing greyhound, this is a must read. These dogs have lots of little quirks due to the way they were raised, housed, fed, and treated at the track that require some transitioning into a home.  This book provides good tips as well as the things you will need to make your hound comfortable in his/her new home."
"These were so cute! And the quality was much better than what I expected. They were a gift and the recipient loved them."
"Again my nephew loved this guy. Any guy with a hat is a hit with him. We'll see how long he keeps track of the hat and bat!"
"I purchased this for my 80-year-old father so he could wear it 24/7 (takes blood thinner). He has almost lost it several times as the clasp keeps coming open and the bracelet slips off. Most times, he doesn't even know he's lost it. I had a jeweler tighten the clasp as much as they could but it still catches on things which pulls the clasp open.  A better, more secure clasp would give this bracelet 5 stars as it is very attractive and a good solid weight."
"puntual el reloj que me llego fue lo que le pedi y tienen precios muy competitivos y original gracias !!"
"Probably my favorite book ever. I can't wait to read more. I can't wait for the movie too! So excited"
"I love the color, the softness  and strechness of the fabric...and it is a perfect size 12..the length as well! Very comfy !"
"Loads of fun."
"This was my second reading of the Lord of the Rings(and the Hobbit before it) in the past 10 years or so.  It is one of my favorite books.  I love the story line with its fantasy and relationships among characters. A classic good vs. evil.  With the second reading I picked up on things I missed the first time---or forgot.  I'm sure I'll read it again in future years."
"I have been wanting to try this forever! Sounds like a great product! I am ready to try it now!"
"Charged really slow. Took forty minutes to charge 7%. Not worth the money or the wait. It also fit very snug"
"great for anyone trying to learn or just to have to review hal leonard corp did well again on this"
"Omg, this book was amazing. I couldn't put it down, the text is incredibly raw yet impossible to put down. Must read."
"a little awkard to use. doesn't shutdown the kindle when you close it. would have preferred a different kind of closure"
"its a decent story, well structured.  Going to read the rest of the series next.  I imagine that this book really just sets the stage for the rest."
"I actually needed a metal-toothed comb for my long cosplay wigs. This works great, and I don't regret purchasing it."
"I like this game because I can have the fun of playing video games while moving my body. Who doesn't like dancing when nobody is looking?"
"I was looking forward to getting slouch socks. Dissappointed. Three are way too small, so I got a pair and a half. Plus I really wanted 100% cotton, but I guess not available"
"I just recieved my KT7800 today, and I absolutely love it! It took about 2 minutes to assemble (counting unpacking it), and it is very sturdy and comfortable. I ordered it regular ship and it arrived in 4 days. I give it 5 stars!"
"Overall I'm pretty happy with this coat. Past reviewers commented that the wool was scratchy, or low quality. Yes, it's scratchy, but not terrible. To be honest, when compared to other wool items that I have, it is pretty smooth. It has a smooth felted feel to it, which is perhaps why past reviewers didn't like it? (It isn't fuzzy soft, or lambswool - it's more like a &amp;#34;motor coat&amp;#34; kind of wool.) The quality is about what I expected for the price. The wool isn't super thick, which I appreciate, so the &amp;#34;skirt&amp;#34; of the coat drapes fairly well. It's warm, windproof, probably not the coat I'd want for sub-zero temperatures, but great for cool brisk November days in Oregon. I liked the studded sleeves better than I expected, they stand out more on the actual coat than they do in the photo, and they add a nice feminine touch. I love the gray color.  Now for the less than ideal... it's not quite as structured as I thought it would be, and it bunches up a little around the waist. The arms could be a little longer but I always have trouble getting coats with long enough arms. I'm 5'8 and ordered the small, but wonder if I should have gotten the extra small - the shoulders fit, but as I mentioned there is a little bunching of some extra fabric around the waist. That seems to always be the trade-off- enough room in the shoulders, or a nice tailored look around the middle. When all is said and done, this coat is a little bulkier than it looks in the photo, but I still like it. I'm keeping it, and in the few times I've worn it, I've gotten a lot of compliments."
"Such a straight forward way of thinking about life, people,places, experiences, making a difference, finding yourself and becoming successful and content with yourself."
"This is really a great cushion, nice and firm for those of you seeking to take the pressure off down under.  This really was a lifesavor to my husband, the quality is great, and shipping was terrific."
"What a fun toy.  It was exactly as it looks and is described.  Our dog loves it, it even doubles as a place to rest his head."
"First time buying it, very good product so far. Keep those snoopers away. I definitely recommend getting it. GET IT, I like it."
"Wall sticker is very pretty. I bought this for my niece who is four years old. Her room really looks nice with this decor."
"The beads are really tiny and I wanted such size. Probably they would turn up into three chains atleast for 144 pieces."
"This is a very good phone I bought for my sister and it was really tiny and cute to look at. It had good memory to fit all my songs and I always liked android OS, it has apps for everything possibly on earth. Samsung's touch screen and wifi connectivity are amazing."
"Great to see what goes around comes around. A fun and satisfying read, like an icecream cone on a summer day. This author always delivers a good time. Just one more fine book from Nikki Sex!"
"but it was worth the wait!!Came in very good condition &amp; the feather pen works nicely.quite pleased with it :D"
"Oh my gosh~I just got it in the mail today and it is absolutely adorable and you can't go wrong for it being 4.24 c:It took a little while to get to me but I didn't mind waiting.So happy with my purchase! :D"
"I am sooooo so glad I bought this!I needed an umbrella for quite some time and I couldn't find the right one for me until I saw this little cutie and I knew I had to get it :]a very good price. 10/10"
"This product is the best hair care I have ever used.  My hair went from straw to silky within weeks.  I have never had as many compliments on my hair in my life.  The copy-cat version of this shampoo leaves your hair flat &amp; dull looking Stick to WEN and you will be a WEN girl forever!"
"Did not notice any changes while taking it for six weeks and would not recommend this product to a friend."
"I prefer the electronic copy because the paper copy has never arrived before the start of the period. The January copy was due in December as at 14Mar13 has not arrived. I will recomend that all subscribers at Our Lady of the Pines Donvale us this method."
"The elephant came in with a giant crack as if it had been dropped and then glued back together. There was glue coming out from everywhere. Supposed to be a cute trinket as a Christmas present but it just looked cheap."
"this fan is sturdy, holds my computer at the proper angle and the blue lights are cool too... its a shame it had to break so soon. within the first week of receiving it one of the three fans quit, but i continued to use it with only two fans remaining. however within four months it was completely broken and nothing but a cheap plastic computer stand. if you are looking for something functional i suggest you spend only a few dollars more as this is too cheap to last for any reasonable amount of time."
"Not what I was expecting.  The five charging cords don't work. Happy with the camo phone case. And happy with screen protectors."
"Did not think I would like it ,but work great 2 dollar buy still works after 6 weeks of hard playing."
"only one thing wrong with the set, the pieces on the ends wont stay on, ive lost one due them coming off all the time. pen writes nice. they are a nice set for a collector"
"It's a shame that a perfectly intelligent writer had to write such a piece of Rubbish.  To call the leading Conservative voice in the United States, a man who fights for States Rights, equal opportunity, equal treatment under the law, and for conservative fiscal and foreign policy a Nazi shows not only a blind contempt for the man, but ignorance of history, particularly concerning Third Reich policy."
"The twists and turns and the internal struggle of a father proved to be a nail biter to the end.  A must read...."
"This radio is great. I work in a mechanics shop where it's constantly loud but you can still hear the radio over everything. It's light weight and all functions work well. Clear sound as well."
"These gauges are pretty cool but would look better if I had a bigger size. The trim on the outside makes it kin of hard to tell what the design is in the middle. They are well crafted though."
"I actually bought this as a christmas gift for my brother in law. But they always have always made awesome music."
"This bracelet is sweet. Like one of the other reviews said,you do have a hard time fitting the pin in the holes but after some use its no problem."
"Sometimes it's nice to read the books regardless of weather you've seen the movie or not. The changes can be interesting in going from written word to script"
"It was a nice read. I think I just get tired of &amp;#34;series&amp;#34; books. Whatever happened to just writing a novel? To me it's getting to the point where it's an underhanded way for writers to get more money."
"Beautifully written and a personal private joy when someone uses words I actually have to look up! Reading a great story and learning along the way is the best storytelling there is. There is no rehashing of old stories here. It is truly a new and fresh way to enjoy monsters and amazing characters"
"We love it. Very sturdy and a great way for us to separate things. Coffee on one shelf, teas on another shelf and cocoa on another. Comes in handy when buying sampler pack varieties."
"My husband's tablet was able to do this without an app and I was so jealous that I couldn't do it on my Toshiba or the Fire so I'm beyond excited to have an app now! It works flawlessly and is fantastic when watching movies...no more missed calls!"
"We've been using this system for about 2 years now. It's easy to maintain affordable and very clean. The cats prefer it over the standard cat litter and box. Ordering thru Amazon with auto ship has been a blessing, we've never run out of pads or the litter pellets"
"This free version does more than most paid apps! Love it! Definitely one I would recommend to my friends! Keep up the great work!"
"It's exactly what I need for what I use it for and its for free so I give it a5 start reading"
"So ithought it was a awesome mouth wash until i just decided to look it up online an just happen to click on the reviews because it had such low reviews an I was like mmh that's weird, so I start reading the reviews an now it's too late my tongue kinda burns an ihave a metallic taste in my mouth awesome..my advice throw it out or get a refund. Idk what to say other than wow.."
"This series of books is very well written. There are plenty of twist and turns throughout the books. The first book as usual is the best of the three, but they are all worth the money. The character development is such that you start to feel that you actually know the characters."
"the item works perfect and is a very very inexpensive price. I greatly and whole hardily endorse this seller. I will be back when I need another cartridge!!"
"this adapter fits and works great the only problem is it gets very warm after awhile it is a great replacement though"
"This is an okay mystery. It is a little predictable but is an easy read that you can enjoy without putting a lot of thought into it. This book would be good for a doctors visit as it is entertaining."
"This case says it is made for the Nikon L820 and it fits perfect with just enough room leftover for my battery charger. The inside zipper pocket is perfect for memory cards while the outside pocket is great for spare batteries."
"This is a great flavor of coffee. It is plenty strong without the burnt taste you get from the french roast. I am very glad I was able to find a good tasting inexpensive coffee for my coffee maker. The only draw back I have found is you have to keep the coffee in a ziploc bag or a similar airtight container after opening each bag (there are 8 pods to a bag). All in all I highly recommend this coffee as a good inexpensive choice for a Keurig style coffee maker."
"The cover fits like a glove. I chose 5 stares because of the tightness of the fit, the way it secures the Nook, and the fact that it comes with an elastic band to keep the cover closed. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a case for their Nook. The only thing that could make this better would be a magnetic closure."
"When I can steal a few minutes to myself to read this it's fantastic! It's great for a nice laugh, I can say I actually laugh out loud!"
"orked great am able to take pigs to 150 yds easily. Used it for a Zombie match also. I also use thesmallermodel for pistols."
"Any one wonder what the futures like this is the book for you.All of a sudden cloulds disapear  the world will die unless you find out what is stopping the rain before you get captured.A brilliant book the characters move around each other very well and form lots of different vibes. I love it."
"This pad loses heat fast.  It is a good value for the price.  I wish it held in the heat longer."
"This is my first trainer, so I&amp;#8217;m not familiar with the noise level of other trainers. I know this one is very loud, so loud; I must turn the sound level on the TV very high to hear the TV. I have it in the garage, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t bother anyone. I do not recommend this product if you are living around (apartment) or with someone."
"Having heard about this tragedy before i also had many questions about how something like this could happen. When i saw the book i was drawn to read it. Reading Jackie's words and seeing the pain she went/ is going through made me realize to never take anything in life for granted. I cried through just about every chapter in this book. Its a tear jerker but once you pick it up you wont want to put it down"
"it came in a box and when i opened it i was so satisfied with this order. i was worried that it might not be what i ordered because there was alot of reviews that said they got a different design and that it's not good but i got my headphones and it satisfied me. it looked just like the picture and the sound quality is great. love it!!"
"Has some awesome music. Just think that as a whole, My Kinda Party was a better album.  Maybe it will grow on me!"
"only reason i gave one star is because NONE was not an option!I ordered an assortment pack of different size screens, and was sent 100 of the smallest ones instead. Seller never responded to attempted contact...  least I wasn't burned for much $"
"First, the only reason it gets one star is because ZERO is not an option!!Half the bag contains Myrrh (if thats what it is) so fine is like fine sand... the rest of the tiny pieces look like dirt.. cant see ANY RESIN at all in the bag...  looks NOTHING like other stuff I have!  stay clear of this stuff ."
"Such a cute series.  This one is a day in the life of an NYC baby- all of the big spots in the big apple are visited."
"Simple and high quality like all under the Nile. Hooray for being made in Egypt as organic !!! I give all of their items five stars for these reasons."
"So relieved that this was made in USA, NOT CHINA, and that it comes with a 10 year warranty.  Very excited to try this out!"
"The fabric is soft, which is great.  It looks like in the picture there are fold overs at the hands to cover baby from scratching herself, but its just a regular sleeve cuff.  For some reason the buttons are placed oddly... there are open flaps between buttons as baby goes about her day.  The cut is very boxy.  Not a lot of length but a LOT of extra room width-wise in the body, arms, legs...  Would probably be perfect for a chubbier baby"
"I read the mixed reviews and bought anyway.  Not as quality an item as I anticipated for the price.  keeping it but not blown away by it.  It is a very dim night light."
"We love that this finish is food safe - that's why we selected it to use for our baby's new crib. It seems like everything now has too many unnessessary additives --- if you are looking for something simple this is it! Beautiful finish. We used three coats on maple. It's nice and light in color. Buttery soft to the touch with the maple. There is still a scent to the finish weeks after its been done. But I'm assuming this is safer than most of the crap used to make baby products nowadays. If we make any other wooden items for baby we will definitely us this as a finish for it"
"the fabric is very, very thin on these and might have been perfect for summer.  seems pretty cheap and poorly made.  also made in China, boo."
"This overnight / carry on bag is just what I was looking for.  The bows are much more sturdy than they appear on the website.  Can't wait to use it!"
"its great I love to play  it on my kindle its much fun then on my phone the only thing that I don't like is the sound but other then that its an awesome game"
"It is an amazing book. The way Dan Brown play with the history, and the artworks that are present in the book is amazing."
"Praying Medic is not just an example but he is a teacher as well. Solid teaching made simple. Hearing what and how others have been through stretching their capacity for God is more than inspiring it is motivating. He leaves you with that feeling this isn't so hard, I think I can do this. My capacity of faith has grown from reading and beginning to apply it more effectively in my own walk. A must read. Thanks, Praying Medic, for putting your heart between the covers!"
"the product was exactly what i was expecting, you could see and feel the high quality the instant you remove it from the packaging. Although one remark I would have is how it is very easy to dirty which some might see as a good thing as the leather ages and gives the case a different feel.p.s. it fit the iPad 3 perfectly"
"My Son loves  for me  reading to reading his to him at bed time. It has become our bed time routine."
"was exactly the size as described........used it in my serger thread is strong and appropriate for the sewing I was doing......quick ship......great price....will definetly use this vender again....."
"I like this word game, sometimes I get a lot of letters that I can't use then I get frustrated, but overall this is a good game"
"HI  I would reccommend this book to any one who needs help with their daily lives,  and any help would be perfect."
"I love this game, I play it alot, everyone needs to purchase this game,  it is a game that is hard to stop playing."
"Wow they're really great I should follow this hopefully wishfully I love these I'm hoarding them for everyone I know for Christmas it gets  thank you"
"THE PRODUCT NOT ARRIVE TO MY HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHERE IS IT !?  PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!! PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!! PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!! PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!! PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!!"
"Arrived early! I bought two of these for my partner and I. Everything we do is electronic as far as paper work goes, so we are either taking up a bunch of space between the iPad, tablet, phones, and tablet/iPad keyboards. We got these yesterday and plugged them in today and they are working great! The blue light that everyone is posting about really isn't a problem in the office. I was actually able to replace my power strip with a smaller one, so everything looks nice and tight and less of a mess. Thanks for the speedy service!"
"Educational and fun.. my 3 year old and my 5 year old play it all the time. They never get bored. Plenty of different puzzles to enjoy"
"This is an outstanding package. High quality, exceptionally inexpensive when compared to buying these items seperately from GoPro. The batteries are better than what came with my camera. Service was very quick."
"I'm somewhat &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to the Sci-Fi/ Fantasy style books, (not new to reading in general by any means), and I thought that the &amp;#34;Song Of Ice And Fire&amp;#34; series was as good a place as any to start out. I would definatley reccommend reading it, but it you're just starting Sci-Fi/Fantasy books like I was, you should start out with something a little bit more light. And I don't mean figuratively either. The book is LONG. Maybe not long as compared to other books of this genre, but long nontheless. If you do decide to read it, have the next book close in hand for when you finish ;)"
"If you've read the first, and enjoyed it, get the second, it has all of the good, and less of the bad (that was minor to begin with). If you were kind of wary after the first, but was on the fence about getting the second, get it. You won't be disappointed :)"
"I enjoyed the Prison of Angles every bit as much as I did of any of Dalglish's other books, which is A LOT! I definitely recommend getting the sixth if you've read the other five."
"Never read this author before.  Would read this author again.  Kept the story interesting as well as the interaction of the characters.  Very satisfied with the book.  B"
"Found it hard to really get into.  A lot of characters to keeps track of.  Maybe just not my kind of book.  May be great read for other people.  Thank  you, B"
"Loved the concept of the story and the relationship that evolved between Alice and Jack.  Have already read Jack Knifed.  Christopher Greyson is a great writer.  Keeps you interested.  Jack is the best.  Will be reading 3rd novel soon."
"i have used it a couple of times.  It gives me something to do when riding with my husband.  A good past time when you don't feel like reading.  I also like the challenge of being timed.  Good fun.  Bea"
"After one wash the seam is coming apart. And I would expect better quality for the price that I paid"
"Haven't even worn these yet and I'm sewing the holes in them up. Even those won't stay long due to the thin, gauze like fabric. Not worth the money."
"Had a mishap but was fixed asap. Very quick to make me happy. Will use them again in the future."
"Bag feels very good. The strap is very thick and comfy. Loving it so far. At this price, its a steal."
"The case fits well and looks just like the picture. The buttons on the side are still easy to use and all the cut outs make easy access to them. This case will do great protecting my phone and I like having the stylus!I did not get the screen cover in my order though."
"I would advise looking elsewhere for a case for your nexus 5. This Spigen slim case only protects the sides of the device, leaving the top and bottom edges unprotected. Because of the nexus 5's curved top and bottom edges, the phone is left extremely susceptible to taking fall damage in those areas. Otherwise, the case feels nice, though looks somewhat unfinished with exposed button cutouts.Advice to Spigen: Offer a slim version of this case with the top and bottom edges covered."
"Loved it"
"I love the comments from the authors, the sheet music is clear and easy to read and the CD makes it perfect.  I'd recommend this to harpists that would like to play Wedding music!"
"If your needing a way to identify and memorize names of surgical tools this is by far the best source out there. Buy this book !"
"easy to use and when you have doc in a higher version of word it easily converts it for you."
"love these they really help with balance, i suggest getting 6 of them so you can walk through them to further you balance.. just an idea"
"Really nice little tv... just make sure you use a HDMI cable. And it has a audio outlet which I really needed."
"good productit is easy to handel and makes fun to entertain friends and the family - we like it very much"
"Pratchett's brillance is once again shared with us in this book. It is the first in Tiffany Aching's series and we meet a young girl we can all look up to and cheer on. We also meet a race of fairy folk, who while we may hope never to met them, are also endearing."
"The story thoroughly pulled me in. After a while I barely noticed the editing errors. Looking forward to the next books."
"This is a very useful app. I honestly have never been very good housekeeping track of my period, and honestly tend to lose track very easily. This very simple to use app has helped a lot.Unfortunately my son, played with my kindle and reset it to factory. I lost everything I had entered in the app. Hopefully it won't happen again. I hope having it connected to an email address will help prevent such a loss should it happen again."
"So much better than the print your own option. Beautiful, proper playing cards. Even reading the cards, during a quick inspection, to ensure they were of expected quality, leads to many a laugh."
"I am absolutely thrilled to have received my cards. They are everything I could have hoped for. I can't wait to order the other expansions."
"I keep being drawn back. It's fun to send ships on voyages and expand to find new people. Upgrading shops and ships brings in the funds quicker. Wish we could upgrade the houses too."
"I am not at all happy with having to log in every single time I want to showcase my photography. zFolio has a much better application right now for that one simple issue."
"Its like someone used it already or its starting to dry out.. Theres barely any product in it. I'm dissapointed."
"It works well with my laptop and the sound quality is awesome. My only problem with it is that the headphones are not adjustable."
"the good thing it was cheap product, great for protecting  against viruses, spam. updates are automticly good product, already instal on all 3 computers"
"I find it hard to believe that ""Lesson in Romance"" is Harmony Evan's debut novel. It has exciting plot twists, passionate love scenes, funny moments, and tender heart-breaking relationship advances. I like how the author shows you what is happening from both Cara's and Alex's perspectives and ignites you with the fire from their chemistry together. To me, one of the features that distinguishes this book from other authors is the description of the setting and the atmosphere. I really feel the author truly comprehends the magical (and sometimes blatantly financial) world of music and music composition, as well as the pressing issue of illiteracy, which somehow continues to exist in our first-world country today. This is more than a thrilling romance novel - Harmony Evans gives us a peek into the bright world of music while also showing us a glimpse of how pressing dark issues like illiteracy and gangs persist today. But - man - Alex can 'play my instrument' anytime. Phew!!  I can't wait to read Harmony Evan's next book!"
"I am a dyed n the wool Debbie Macomber fan and I always like her books, especially her Christmas ones."
"I like the Creed family members, always have and very likely always will.  Linda Lael Miller can be depended on for a good story."
"Item is plastic, not chrome.  The silver is a metallic chrome-like finish.  I am not returning the item because I do like it, but feel that the item description is misleading."
"I bought two of these as gifts and niether one them worked.  They both locked my laptop up when i plugged them and music could not be loaded onto them."
"The Kindles (3) i bought are just plain fantastic.  I love my Apple probucts but the whole Naziism of but Itunes stuff sucks.  Ipad has nothing on the my kindles....grab n drop is so nice.  Bye Itunes!"
"I loved this book!  It has amazing characters and an amazing love story.  I am moving onto book two to see what happens.  A must read in my eyes.  I would definitely recommend to others"
"Loved this trilogy!  Once you start you can not stop. Amazing love story,  lots of up and downs but it's worth it in the end!  Love this type of story, even though there it's love of tragedy, love prevails!"
"I just loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  It will make you laugh and make you cry. Enjoy !"
"I loved this book.  Amazing love story.  Keeps you on the edge.Definitely a cliff hanger, but I still loved it."
"I loved the book-if you like romance and sexy love scenes this is a book for you!  A must read!"
"When I received this case I was so excited it fit my kindle very well but the quality is.  Little low well I guess you get what your pay for ."
"Very nice elliptical... EASY to assemble and is sturdy. I have no complaints whatsoever. Very pleased with this machine. *****"
"Simply doesn't work,rash my skin I used it about month and half and no significant results just waist of mony and time"
"I like it better than the sheath that came with the tool. That surprised me. I needed it quickly and it came before I expected it."
"It's a good, solid display piece made of super cheap moldable polymer. You could try to use it as a face mask, but, you'll be disappointed. Came in good time and was undamaged."
"These are a great tool to have on your person at all times. You may not use it for months, but when you need it and it's right there, you'll be super glad you had it.These are higher quality than others I've had. They came in a timely fashion. The packing was a bit primitive,  but didn't affect my opinion of the product. If you're wanting to buy with the intention of selling, or having stocking stuffers/random prizes for campers, or whatnot,  you can buy 100 pc. lots and get much better deals per piece if you buy from another source online. But , if a few are enough, buy here!"
"Strong characters, funny situations. Entertaining."
"I've received many compliments and questions about where I got this shirt, and I have yet to find anything similar in a retail store. It definitely has a unique style with the faux leather panel across the chest. It is probably the most unconventional item in my closet."

"I needed a bike mount for my phone for when I go to unfamiliar places. I saw this and it looked like what I was looking for. It wasn't too expensive either. It was shipped quickly and installation was easy. It easily held my GS4 in all types of cases. I used it for directions so that I don't need to hold my phone or have earphones in to see directions. The only problem is that the phone shook a lot no matter how tight I had the mount. This shaking caused the phone's position to shift constantly. I used it quite frequently. About 4-5 times per week for 1 hour each time. I was riding around, and I hear a slight crack as I'm riding on a slightly bumpy sidewalk. Then I hit a minor bump (barely 1 inch) and the phone-holding part completely separated from the mount. I did have a very protective case on my phone, but if I didn't, my phone would have been destroyed. Honestly I only recommend this product if you are only staying on paved streets."

Another review compared it to Sally's Beauty hair saying it was better and I completely disagree. Wasn't as long as stated and was thin at the bottom. It definitely won't hold up to heat and styling very long. It's going back."

"This movie had the same title as the one I'm looking for but this wasn't it.  Back in the 1980's I saw a Hidden Agenda movie that had no Americans in it and the topic was more IRA related.  The main character was English.  I do not recall his name.  The items offered with this title did not match the subject matter I was looking for.The movie I purchased was good but not what I was looking for."
"Akira is a classic. If I can run at you screaming &amp;#34;TETSUOOOOOO&amp;#34; and you don't start screaming back &amp;#34;KANEDAAAAA&amp;#34; then I don't want to know you exist. The imagery and theming behind this movie influenced countless anime and scifi works to come. Chances are something will feel familiar and you'll realize that you've already seen references. If you haven't seen Akira already, get electricity and GET ON THAT. BREH!"

"The product arrived quickly and the packaging was nice. I have only been using this for a couple of weeks but I have noticed improvement in the way my skin looks and feels. My skin looks brighter and fine lines have shown some improvement. I have a couple of dark spots I hope will fade as I continue to use it. I had been using a different Vitamin C serum I purchased a couple of months before I found this one. It was priced the same but the results were not even close.  I have to say OUI is far superior and their customer service is excellent. I will be buying this product from them again."
"This is the cheapest place to get this product by far :) I decided to try this product to help with my dogs fatty tumors, at the advice of my friend. Gave him 1oz per day. After several weeks, the tumors started to shrink! There was a significant reduction in size. They went from a softball size to around golfball size. Then after a cpl months, the tumors started to grow back. :(  They returned to their original size. I may try the gel in addition to the neutralizer and see if that helps. It was very amazing how they shrunk, even if only for a while."

When sizing them keep this in consideration; measure around your gut, not where you normally wear your pants.Secondly the pant legs are so wide I could hide a case of PBR and still have room.Lastly the inseam is longer than advertised.I am keeping them, but next time I'll probably just go with some rainbow suspenders. They would probably look less ridiculous.For the record I ordered 30x30"

At first it seemed as if it wasn't going to work but after couple tries and changes of outlets it started working. now it works on all of them. over all really cheap charger and it does the same thing as the HP replacement. I spent more than $100 buying directly from HP and the charger burned out exactly after a year. so I kept searching til I found this on amazon, found a lot of other ones as well but I decided to give this one a try. I'm happy I did, No complaints, got it in 3 business days, works great.If they sell a back up battery for HP too I'd buy that too, good customer service over all."

"Not for the overly sensitive. If you get offended then don't bother. If you enjoy a good laugh, do it!! So super funny. I totally enjoyed it. My only issue is that it's short. But hey it's a kid book...hahaha!"
"Another great book by the king. Only 3.5 stars in that this is typical king. I hold his bar a little higher. Very good book. Reminds me of dollens Cadillac."
"this game is so fun I enjoy it sooooooo much and it is so eddicting I can not stop playing it"
"I started reading this and figured it would be pretty much the same as all of the others I've read recently (all of which I ended up loving in one sense or another).  But as I kept reading, I loved this even more.  I had fear throughout that I would end up in tears, and that they wouldn't be sappy happy ones.  Just as I'd predicted, I read the last few pages, tears running down my cheeks.  This is definitely worth reading, especially for someone who not only enjoys a good love story, but also for anyone that believes that miracles can and do happen."
"This book didnt just rehash the &amp;#34;Amityville Horror&amp;#34; but focused on the true horror....the murders themselves and insight on this case. I cant understand why people still think the amityville horror was a true story. read this book and you will not be disappointed as it gives the REAL true story on this tragic event."

"I highly recommend this driver side power non-heated mirror. It fits exactly as the original mirror that came with the Nissan Sentra SL car. I took the silver colored lid off the original mirror from Nissan and slipped it on to this new mirror because it came in black, and it was a perfect fit. Also, I saved about $100 by ordering it from Amazon. I am thrilled!!!"
"Very good"
"I love this DVD, I am a filmmaking student , I will introduce this film for my classmates in the class. So I chose it"
"I just recived this product a bit ago...actually recived it a day earlier then what i was told...which was quite nice!BUT...if you have a white iphone beware...because the pics show it with a black iphone in it so the case is not nearly as dark at the pics show it is. Its quite light. But its very cute and its a good rubber case. I would definetly order this case again but in a different color! Totally worth the price and protects the phone pretty decently :) very satisfiedThey just need to show this with a white iphone as well as black so people dont get the wrong idea :)"
"I really like this...its simple easy and its still compact enough with it being a wallet so that I can keep my cards and stuff in it if need be. One little thing...is that its not quite as snug around my iphone as i thought it would be. But it still holds it nicely! Its not a case for everyday use...in my life at least...i use it when making quick trips to the store...or going out to dinner or something with friends. Worth the price and i would buy it again :)"
"This game is a keeper.I have played it for awhile and never get tired of it. I have it on two devices."
"As are all Nicolas Sparks books it is very hard to put down. This is definetely one of his great books!"
"I have a lot of fun playing this game. It's a wonderful challenge without being to difficult and it's easy to learn."
"This book had me from the beginning, I just couldn't put it down until I finished it, so that means I stayed up all night until finished."

"I was with the 19th TASS Chu Lai and few 16 hours under TIC conditions. At first I thought it was cool but then I saw the ground fire, which changed my attitude. The FAC were a different breed and deserve all the respect. They flew the slow birds and were in constant danger as they were easy targets.I was a Radio Operator call sign Helix Control 66-67."
"The shipping was on time and this is sssooo cute :))I want to buy for different color and it fits perfect .My friends loved this alot when I wear on . She said she will get one too :)Thank you for the cute oxford ^^"
"Works well except after a rain.  Then it works after it dries out a bit. That's all I have to say."
"I use these for dog training and they work best for me. They are loud, clear and  have no pea!"
"Mostly its a piece of junk.  Only works up close and you can hear people coming with the human ear at that range."
"I received this product complimentary in my #vowvoxbox from influenster for testing purposes.  I thought this product had a great scent; the consistency was not too thick, which I find to be very helpful, especially during the 90+ degree days of the summer.  I found that once applied, the moisturizer absorbed quickly into my skin, without leaving behind an oily residue.  I used it once in the a.m., after cleansing my face and before bed, using the same routine (cleanse, moisturize).  Also, a little bit goes a long way with this product, which I am pleased with because that means one jar will last at least half a month."
"Not too hard, but not too easy. Just the right balance. I'll be sad when I get finished with the puzzles supplied."
"Not too sure about this game yet.  It has a solo setting that is timed, but doesn't seem to give you much time to win. If the number called isn't on your card, you have to tap an arrow to get the next number.  There is a &amp;#34;social&amp;#34; setting, but I haven't had anyone else on to compete with. I'll give it a few more days, but may end up deleting it."
"Mostly enjoyable hidden object game where you earn coins to purchase other items to furnish a room.  Don't like the rooms where you have to unscramble the clues to find what you are looking for, or the rooms where you are shown just a silhouette to find the object."
"It's a microphone.  You plug it in and it works very well.  What more can I say?  For the money it is a good buy."
"Drop in replacement that works as expected.  Easy to install and hookup and runs very quiet.  I hope it lasts as long as the original did."
"These run a little small but they worked. I ended up having to buy a skirt to cover up how tight they were around the more private section but otherwise they did the job for an 80's party I threw."
"I got this for an 80's party Im having. The colors arent as bright as in the picture, but it will do the job."
"This book was so great. I actually got into it after falling in love with the movie journey 2. Very interesting. A must read. After reading 20,000 leagues under the sea and journey to the center of the earth I had to read the books because the movie made it seem a whole lot cooler. And the book is awesome"
"This book is just like a spin off of twilight. I had to catch myself cause I actually just sat back and read 4 chapters the night I bought it. This is a great book. Please read it"
"Really love this Bluetooth it's loud snout for me not to have it on my ears. Really love it. Great product"
"This is a great case. It came earlier the the estimated delivery time. And I'm getting great compliments on it. It's one of a kind in my book"
"Smells like fruit.  Mostly coconut.  I like it! a little goes a long way: 1 bottle per gallon.  Next time I&amp;#699;ll try strawberry!"
"There are tons of positive reviews (and negative ones too!) on this blade and this is going to be yet another.  For a really good review on this blade, check out Nutnfancy's review on YouTube.  Just search using Kershaw OSO Sweet. Nutn's will be one of the first ones that comes up.  He's got all the main info on this knife in the description, and gives it a 9/10 rating.  Anyway, take it for what it's worth.Here's my take:The knife was $16 bucks (actually only $11 DOLLARS, + $4.99 shipping via USPS) SHIPPED... TO HAWAII.  It doesn't get much better than that!  I like the blade shape, and it's a good length for EDC. Almost exactly the same length as my Spyderco Tenacious, but a shorter handle.  And LIGHT. I like that A LOT.  I carry a Streamlight ProTac flashlight with my blade in my right front pants pocket, so this Oso Sweet is gonna be great because it won't weigh my pocket down very much.The blade:Steel is 8Cr13MoV.  Decent enough quality for me. (ESPECIALLY in a $16 dollar knife!)Blade length is perfect, again for EDC.SHARP as hell, right out of the box.Hard to deploy right out of the box.  I'm going to oil it a little bit, and try to work it in...but it's a little stiff to open.NO blade play at all, up/down/left/right. Very good there.I wish the liner lock stuck out just a little bit more so it would be easier to unlock. Not a big deal, but that would be nice.Blade is fairly close to centered when closed.  It's not perfectly centered, but almost.  No big deal...(remember...$16 bucks!!!)Handle:Plastic, lightweight...not sure how durable at this point, but again...$16 bucks?!!!I like the ""spiderweb"" texture, it's interesting to me.Wish it had some jimping along the top, but it's not a dealbreaker.Clip:As others have mentioned...it is REALLY strong.  Almost TOO much.  I think the clip is a little short as well.  I like the look of it though, with Kershaw along the side.  Nice looking but a little too much tension.  I can see it ripping up some types of pants fabrics if I'm not careful.Overall:Great EDC blade for this price. It may not be a Benchmark, but for what it IS...it's probably the best quality in a $16 dollar knife I've ever had. I wasn't actually looking for a new blade, but had this one saved in my wishlist.  So when I saw this knife on sale on Amazon...I HAD to get it at this price. And I'm SO GLAD I did!  I would recommend this knife, even if it was $25 bucks.  That's still a good price on this blade. If it's still on sale for $11 plus $4.99 shipping...BUY IT.  Right now I wish I bought TWO.And please...those of you who are comparing this knife to other more expensive, higher quality steel, G-10 Scales, made in the USA, blah-blah-blah, etc etc etc, knives... There is NO COMPARISON. If you want THAT knife...go buy that one. But...pull out any and EVERY other $10-$15 dollar knife, and compare that one to this $16 dollar Kershaw OSO Sweet, and let's see how THAT comparison looks.  This blade will beat out almost EVERYTHING in it's price range.Nuff Said."
"It works...but for some reason it seems like it&amp;#699;s not quite as &amp;#34;billowy&amp;#34; or as &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; as regular fog juice.  I bought this to try it out, and see the difference.  It&amp;#699;s not bad.  But it&amp;#699;s not great either.  Don&amp;#699;t get me wrong...I&amp;#699;m not unhappy at all.  Just giving my review in comparison to a regular juice. I&amp;#699;m not really sure what the ECO is, I haven&amp;#699;t looked it up yet, but if it&amp;#699;s a good product that&amp;#699;s good for the environment...it&amp;#699;s good for me.  I&amp;#699;m going to research what the ECO part of it is, and then make another review.BUT...I&amp;#699;d buy it again, especially if it&amp;#699;s good for the environment."
"Yes I gave it 5 stars.  It&amp;#699;s bright. Not just bright...I mean BRIGHT.  It throws light far!  I was helping to set up a couple of big party tents for an event this past saturday morning...at 4:30AM, and and everyone there had a flashlight or headlamp.  When I turned this little guy on..I was completely blown away at the amount of light it had.  I got a few good comments when it was on the med setting...and when I turned it on HIGH...it blew EVERYONE away that it could even step up a notch! I&amp;#699;ve got regular alkaline AA&amp;#699;s in it now...and it&amp;#699;s STILL really bright.  I&amp;#699;ll be buying lithium AA&amp;#699;s and we&amp;#699;ll see how long those last in comparison and if the brightness is different.  I personally really like the wide beam and how much light it throws.  I like that it&amp;#699;s so slim and light but packs a wallop of light! I also like the length of the light.  It fits nicely in my hand and I can operate it easily with my thumb on the button.  Because I live in Hawaii, it was important to me that this light be waterproof, and built to last. We&amp;#699;re exposed to heavy rain, hot sun, ocean spray and salt water... so I wanted a light that I could accidently drop in a puddle in torrential rain.With that being said, the only thing I wish it had is a side switch/button to change between modes like my other Olight: M20 Tactical Warrior.  BUT...that&amp;#699;s not a deal breaker by any means, I STILL LOVE this light.  I don&amp;#699;t mind twisting the upper bezel to get it to change modes. I&amp;#699;m glad that it stays in the last mode you left it in. I think the lowest setting is a little TOO low.  I don&amp;#699;t imagine when I&amp;#699;d use it.  I keep it on the med setting.  I know there are comparable flashlights that are A LOT more expensive and made in the US... and even less expensive flashlights...but I really liked Olight&amp;#699;s torture test, and how much abuse they can take.  My M20 has been so good to me, and I have had nothing but good experiences with Olight, purchasing this T25 light was an easy choice. The hardest part was choosing between the T20 or the T25.  I picked the T25 because of it&amp;#699;s length.  I think the T20 is a little too short for me personally.So it gets 5 stars from me, and it was well worth the money."
"So I bought this for my T25 with high hopes.  I've been extremely happy with my T25 as well as my M20 Warrior flashlights.  My M20 is mounted to my AR, but the T25 I've been using as a hand held for night &amp;#34;ops&amp;#34; (ok it's not really op's....just night boar hunting!)  The green filter actually works great.  I like it a lot.  But I don't like the FIT of the filter on my T25.  It's on..but comes off VERY easily.  As one of the other reviewers stated, only the very top of the inside of the filter is what holds it to the flashlight. I wish it stayed on a little tighter.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not a bad product overall, as I said the filter part is good.  It's just that I'm afraid I'm going to lose this thing in the bush one night.My fix: I have a roll of 1/2 inch black gaffer's tape that I strapped around the bottom of the filter, and taped it to my T25.  So far it works.  I haven't been in the rain yet...so we'll see.  Another idea I have is to put a rubber band thru the lanyard hole and run that thru the clip, so hopefully if the filter falls off, it's still attached to the light."
"This fits the Trailmaster Limited perfectly.  I live in Hawaii so I need a cover that is medium to heavy duty, that will keep rain (and in turn...RUST) off my smoker.  I&amp;#699;ve seen a number of YouTube videos of smokers that are totally rusted from being left out in the rain.  If you have a Trailmaster Limited, it fits perfectly and it&amp;#699;s priced right.  The Amazon price was actially less than it is at my local Home Depot.  No tax and free shipping.  Can&amp;#699;t go wrong there."
"Ok, so this is the 3rd one I&amp;#699;ve purchased. I own one, and I&amp;#699;ve given two as gifts.Here&amp;#699;s my take... bass is nothing to write home about.  However, this unit is MUCH better than my phone speaker, so when listening to music on my phone...THIS little oontz is better than what I have.  Does it match the sound quality of a Bose or JamBox?  C&amp;#699;mon... let&amp;#699;s be real.  NO.  But then again, I didn&amp;#699;t spend $200 bucks on it either!  And it&amp;#699;s inexpensive enough, that I bought THREE of them, two to give away.  And the teenagers who have the other two...LOVE IT!The one negative I have is that I don&amp;#699;t believe it actually lasts 10 hours on ONE charge. (I think it says that on the manual I got, but I may be mistaken)  I think it&amp;#699;s more like 6-8 hours. Still though... It&amp;#699;s worth $39 bucks.  If you want something that&amp;#699;s better than your iPhone or Android phone speaker... Get this, and buy with confidence.  If you want better bass, and fuller sound reproduction...then buy the Bose.  For me... $39 bucks for something I can throw in my bag and go to the beach with...or give 2 away as gifts...PERFECT!Update:One odd thing... so these two didn&amp;#699;t come with the little carrying bag.  Not a deal breaker, but my nephews both said the bag wasn&amp;#699;t in the box.  Mine came with a nice little felt bag that you&amp;#699;re able to carry all of the cables in, but theirs didn&amp;#699;t.  Like I said, not that big of an issue, if mine hadn&amp;#699;t come with one, they wouldn&amp;#699;t have even noticed but since it did... they brought it up."
"Chris has a great voice and I hope that he keeps making good music .I would recomend this to people that like good muisc."

"I like TV that is interesting and keeps you guessing.I would recomend this program. Hope it gets good ratings."
"didnt work properly had to mess with the cable. but as they say, you get what you pay for. customer service was rude and not reliable. will not buy from these jerks again. refused to give me my full amount of money back. geuss thats why they are poor saps."

"This was a great read and a fast one since it kept my interest. The love story and romance was engaging, and the possibilities when the characters opened their minds and hearts made my heart smile."
"it is good for this price. maybe I am too thin, the costume is too short and fat for me. But I am still very happy when wearing it. and that is enough :)"
"First of all when I received the flat iron I immediately wanted to try it out. Upon turning it on it filled my whole house with a stench of burning plastic. I thought well its brand new maybe it'll go away. It didn't. The smell occurs every time I turn it on.Also I have thin slightly wavy shoulder length hair. It doesn't take much from a flat iron to straighten my hair. However with this useless iron it takes me at least 45 mins to get my hair straight and then about thirty minutes later (after my hair completely cools) it is right back to how it was before I flat ironed it.This iron doesn't get up to 430 degrees I don't care what the description says. It also pulls and yanks out my hair.Just turn away right now. If you would like a good flat iron I replaced this piece of crap with a jilbere porcelain flat iron. Works amazing! And it's not that much more expensive. I suggest looking that one up!Happy shopping!"
"Received game is random case with scratch and actual (what appear to be food) stains on it. Honestly baffled by this, at least clean the disk. Also game doesn't work"
"Wow!! I loved this book as much as the others. When I bought Come Away with Me I couldn't put it down and when I finished it I had to buy the others to read.  This series is the best so far.  Will and Meg have such chemistry together. I like how Will is interested in Meg when she shows him she isn't interested in him in the beginning. Then once he goes to the hospital where Meg works to visit the Children's ward, things start to get interesting. Their relationship has there ups and downs but in the end they fall so in love with each other that you can't help but fall with them.  I like how Kristen Proby writes about the other characters, Luke, Nat, Jules, and Nate in each book. I love reading about this family, keep it going Kristen, the Montgomery men are worth reading about!!"

"Awesome thing to have for trips or even if you are just in an area where there is no outlet or charger. The one bad thing is that you have to take you cover off to charge phone because of the large output port"

"""Live from Mongolia"" by Patricia Sexton is a fun book with a powerful message to embrace your passions and follow your dreams.  Ms. Sexton walks away from a lucrative, although high-pressured career as a Wall Street banker to become an unpaid intern at a Mongolian television station.  As an ex-investment banker I can appreciate and admire this gutty decision.  The author uses her natural reporter's eye to paint a vivid picture of her adventures in Mongolia.  She deftly mixes in history with her personal narrative to educate and entertain the reader.  After returning to NYC, Ms. Sexton briefly returns to Wall Street, but swiftly realizes that she can no longer sell out for money.  The price is too high and there is too much to lose to walk away from her new passion in life.  This book would make a great Christmas present for high school and college students struggling with what to do with their lives.  The lesson is simple.  Throw caution to the wind, follow your heart's desire and give it everything you got."

"Rise of Nations is still my favorite strategy game.  To give a little more detail than the description, Rise of Nations allows the player to take control one of over 20-something different nations and wage war against others through 2,000 years of history spanning several &amp;#34;ages&amp;#34;.  Conquer the world through force, diplomacy, technological advances in campaign mode, or just play quick battles with detailed pre-sets including population limits, starting age, enemy difficulty, dozens of maps, and diplomacy.  Not sure if the online multiplayer is still supported but it's not really necessary to have a great time.  Nevertheless, it's also a fun time."
"Baby girl will play with this for hours!!! Absolute favorite toy until she disembowels it. No mess - just beware the squeaker if the dog was to swallow it..."
"It does it job. Afterall, it is simple bar stock with lapping compound. Have seen same kit in a decent plastic case after purchase. That would have been preferred...."
"its the perfect size to mix those few ingredients for a family size cake1 i'm enjoying it a lot"
"i found this whisk to be just what i needed. it whisks up those few ingredients in no time and its pretty reasonable too"
"It was so exciting. Absolutely stunned by the drama. I could not stop reading it was addictive.Well, James Cavendish is addictive!"
"i liked the plot, couldn't stop reading it. Wasn't as unreal as other similar books, although it had certain similarities with 50 shades."
"Fantastic knife. SHARP. Right out of the box. Lifetime guarantee. I use it as my work knife, (apartment maintenance) and I couldn't be more pleased. Came with a sturdy leather holder. Wouldn't hesitate to buy this again, not that I will likely ever need to..."
"Not bad, very vicious little blade. Came with a few small stains on the blade, which may or may not be a CRKT issue. Doubtful it had to do with the seller. Sheath is a little hard to assemble, and not the best design. I do like the knife though, but not quite what I had hoped for. Still, excellent sharpness and the full tang is nice. Very lite weight also."
"The reason I got into knife collecting. One of the most interesting blades you'll ever see. Good steel, LAWKS system essentially makes it a fixed blade, very sharp right out of the box. Love this knife."
"This is one hell of a knife! Came sharper as a razor out of the box. Very beautiful design as well, with good G10 grips. If you need a tough knife, this is a can't-miss."
"Good knife, just way too big for a pocket knife. The handle is HUGE. LAWKS system is solid; definitely no play in the blade. Good knife overall, but not good for pocket carry. Came with extra clip, which is always nice. For 20 bucks, not a bad buy. Ill keep it in my truck."
"quality, excellent, superb, exemplary, superior, ultimate, beyond, fancy, resplendent.Frasier is the greatest show of all time.This product worked."
"This is one HECK of a knife. It has excellent gimping, feels great in my medium sized hands, superb deployment and the steel is sharper than a surgical scalpel. Zero Tolerance is great knife company and these knives are easily on par with Spyderco and Benchmade."
"nice little knife. very sleek, well oiled, sharp design. Sarenmu makes a good product. For the price, a very good value."
"This is my 8th Invicta watch, Very nice Watch to use for business or casual attire. Love the design and classy look! Worth every penny,"
"A great mix of characters and the flashback points get you engaged. Zombies and Superheroes is always a great mix and Clines makes a awesome story. My only complaint is that it ended too quickly."
"It was a great purchase and a great price. It is helping me a lot with my recovery. L. G."

"I really wanted to stop using Quicken Essentials.  I was a Quicken 2007 user and as many of you know that came to an end with the Intel chip.  I liked the ability to track investments and other features and Essentials is a really dumbed down version.  With iBank 5 you view your investments using reports.  Awkward in my opinion.  It does a nice job of bringing in ALL my financial info, something that Essentials doesn't do.  I'm updating over 15 accounts.  That said, it takes forever to do this process in iBank.  If you want this to be automatic, prepare to pay for a yearly subscription to IGG Software's Direct Access ($40) or monthly ($5) on top of the $60 you shelled out for the iBank 5 program.  This should be free and part of the program in my opinion.  You can download files from banks and upload them for free but this takes too much time.  The user can't change many view options.  You're stuck with a check book view, 2 lines and taking up way to much screen.  Save your money."
"this is simply THE moka pot. it works perfectly, does the job efficiently, and most of all, is easy of maintenance. light and seemingly durable (remember, though, it's aluminium, not steel!)."
"I loved it! I didn't know what to expect and I'm still thinking &amp;#34;wait, what?&amp;#34;  I identify with so many aspects of this book and i found Tom so likeable even though if you met him in real life that would be debatable. So much more I could say but in a nutshell: congratulations and very well done."
"my son has been watching this non stop since we rented it from the library. thought I must buy it for him. Now we have it to enjoy every Christmas. thank you for the perfect condition and the super speedy delivery"
"I love rick steves. I have never step foot out of the us but his optimistic approach to travel as well as his low stress attitude make this show a joy to watch. I am so happy to own this collection  and such a deal :)"
"excellent. Thank you Levi's are my favorite jeans. comfortable and flattering. couldn't be more happy with this purchase. would recommend to anyone who wants comfortable jeans that look like a million bucks"
"I cant complain because I have worn this every evening since its arrival. However I think I should note that it is not as soft as expected and the color was very very off. I ordered the rust color and it is pictured a very nice dark rusty color. The robe I got was more of a light rust (looked like it had been washed 100 times or more like a primrose. Despite this I really do love and will not return it. The quality is great and I feel I will have it for years to come"
"I love this book because it feels like I am in the book with Alex and Connor I am excited for the next book."
"This book was awesome. It took me  two weeks to read  the wide awake princess because I could not take my eyes off the book"
"At first this was a good purchase I felt but as I continued to use this product (only a few months old) the sound becomes more and more muffled.  You can't really hear any of the sounds at all.  In order to get that muffled sound out you have to turn down the volume very low to where you can't really hear anything.  I am very upset with this product.  I really was hoping that it would work better."
"This book was a great book. I read it in a couple of hours. I couldn't put it down. Trust me u won't regret buying it. I can't wait for the sequel!!!"
"They are always giving away good books for free. If they say leave your email to receive it in the next few minutes it's coming to your email. They always promote their up and coming books and include a little sample that keeps you on edge until that day. I'm your # 1 Fan!!! I have the gold and silver edition. They were giving 10 away and I was able to be one of them."
"The first number of games has an ad displayed after the deal. In order to get to the game you must go home then tap on Solitare again. This is very annoying."
"MAYBE this would work for the range, but I would never carry this for any reason. The first time that I used it the ball bearing that sits on top of the spring fell out and it no longer stays opened or closed... Its a piece of junk. I have used other speedloaders and own several now, but i would never buy another HKS and never another from Amazon, to many knock-off products lately."
"I got this for a cheap and easy way to heat up water while camping with my kids. I didnt put much faith in it because of the price. It did take quite a while to ship but at this price you can not beat it. I have not used it very hard yet, thats why i am giving it 4 stars, will update it after some serious use. Case is flimsy, but what can you expect?"
"If this is all that you can afford then go for it, otherwise at least buy a Nebo, or a box-store flashlight because this is junk and it will frustrate you."
"No patent number on lock, wrong roll pin, no T marks,,, its NOT A MIDWEST INDUSTRIES MOUNT.Just charged me $80 for a $30 knock off.. It is going backWay to many pirated goods on Amazon now, going to shop directly with manufacturers and authorized dealers from now on."
"No way to adjust the reticle brightness, is ok in low light but in sunlight it is so bright that it washes out the target and leaves ghost images on your retina,, not good for outdoors during the day, might be ok for home defense, but with no on-off switch your battery might be dead when you hear something go bump in the night.. I would skip it."
"Put this on my Mosin M44, it leaves a small gap between the grip and the stock but its tolerable, especially for the money. Easy install, it helps to drill a small pilot hole and to use a screwdriver, dont use a power tool or you can strip out the hole or crack your stock."
"This went on easy and is touch as nails. My kids could destroy an anvil with a rubber hammer and they cant manage to tear this up. They did break the screen on one nabi but this screen protector is holding the broken pieces together and they are still able to use the nabi.Once you start getting decent screen protectors for your electronics you will see the value in them."
"I have to give it a 5 star rating because I only paid $39.99 delivered for it. Really the only thing that they could have improved on is the zipper pulls. I fixed that by tying my own with 550 cord (paracord), and they look great, learn how to on youtube if you dont know already.The material is maybe 600D, could be a little thicker especially if your going to load down the large outside pocket. Speaking of pockets its got more than enough of them to keep your stuff organized. I especially like the main compartment dividers and that one of them has a padded compartment for a laptop, touchpad, whatever.I wouldnt have paid full price for it, but if I really had to have it and did pay a hundred or more I wouldnt have felt cheated. At fourty buck delivered it was an incredible deal. I bought one for myself and one to give away. Buy it, you cant go wrong with this bag."
"It does its job so well I have dropped my phone and it was fine. I love my ballistic case."
"I just had a great desktop I build but I had no NIC(Network Interface Card) installed and they can get pricey so I'm glad I bought this. It worked perfectly and it's a  cheap solution. It's easy to install and use. I highly recommend it."
"I found this book thrilling from beginning to end. Cannot wait to read the rest of her books and others suggested at end."
"I liked the information given on why we should or should not consume certain fats, etc.  Dr. Wythe not only gave reasons about topics he also went into detail.  That was my most favorite part of his book.  It would have been nice if the charts were in the book rather than have to go online to retrieve them--that is the only thing I did not like about his book--not having the charts to refer to as I read the book.  I am trying some of the recommendations and menus given--bot not all.  Furthermore, I would recommend this book to anyone intereseted in knowing what they should and should not do to lose weight."
"I really enjoyed this book. It seemed a little bit short. I would recommend this book to everyone. I would have like it to be longer. It had an abrupt ending."
"I really enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes good reading.  I don't like swearing and cussing in the books I read.  This book passes my type of reading."
"I didn't appreciate the language. There should be away of knowing the type of language before you purchase. I like clean language. Wouldn't recommend this to my friends. I will stick with authors I know. Jthompson"
"Outfit arrived very promptly but was very disappointed in the lame' cat appique. To me it made the outfit look cheap. Cute outfit if the applique was't that Gold Lame' Stuff. It rjuined it for me.I gave this a 2 star rating because of the applique and the fact that the return date was only 10 days from date of receipt. My fault I guess for not really looking at the outfit when it 1st arrived."
"They are comfortable shoes and can really go with anything thaty why I ordered three pairs. In three different colors so many people ask where they came from."
"Hot hot hot! Congrats Carmen, can't wait for book no. 2!! Fantastic job great writing leaving us wanting much more!"
"very good part.  easy install with factory look.  would purchase again and would tell friends about this product and it was shipped quickly but no charge"
"GREAT LIGHTS.  I PUT THEM ON A PONTOON BOAT.  THEY ARE VERY BRIGHT"
"I was very happy to find this watch for my husband. He works in construction and the real expensive watches don't work for him. He likes this one and if he has an accident with it we can replace it without spending a fortune! He liked it so much I ordered a second one. Thanks for being there."
"Great Shoes!  Exelene Quality!  They feel like a glove! They came with individual bags and a cleaning cloth! As always, fast service."
"One of the most sweet books I've ever read and I hope more to come from the author. Great job."
"At first I didn't think that this would be as accurate as it said. It just seemed like a fun little app but all the times I've used it its been pretty accurate. =)"
"the only problem is that it take forever for someone else to play. Also not evertone is as smart as i am :)"
"Bought this to keep my 2 year old from running down the driveway into the street. So far its been great! Was not difficult to install even having to install one end into cement. Would recommend to others."
"The graphics for the Blu ray version are astounding in my opinion any movie made by Spielberg is a movie worth watching for the tech they had back then they did a lot of good work the dinosaurs look astounding and realistic the animatronics are fantastic whenever the t rex is in a scene it has power and feel to it and will have any child gripping his chair with white knuckles the soundtrack is amazing and beautiful it has the large feeling that was mandatory for a movie like this I am going to say that in my opinion Jurassic Park is the best movie ever."
"I think that the second book is better than the 1st one. The plot is exposed and the characters of heros are described."
"It was my first time getting one and i have to say it works wonderfully its helping me with my drawings majorly"
"like it, worth what i payed for. i digged the color too went along well with my black electric violin."
"Bought this Item in June 2013. The first time i used it, it was working pretty good except that i noticed for a fact that the pedometer didnt work at all. THEN i noticed that after 15-20min of using it the machine felt &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; per say didnt quite gave me a challenge so then i noticed these markings next to the hydrolics and decided to see if that was the cause of the problem and no it didnt fix anything. I tried the machine a couple more times before i actually gave up on it and after a 2 weeks this hook that locks the stepper with the machine broke off which made the machine useless after that. Want my opinion dont buy it save your money for something better. I'm actually going to throw mines away."
"Honestly i didnt like it. If youre a busy person who constantly checks her phone for messages or maybe just to look at the time . this product is NOT for you. You would constantly need to be fliping the protector off and in busy moments that gets really frustrating. Just my point of view."
"The case fits good, but does not stand up to good it is very flimsy when you try to sit it up."
"These are great sturdy straws.  I don't notice a metallic taste when using them. They're not the best for smoothies, but perfect for drinks.  I'd definitely purchase cleaning brushes as well."
"I purchased these to clean my stainless steel drinking straws.  The smallest fits tightly enough to wash the regular drinking straws and the widest ones fit well enough to clean my wide plastic smoothie straws.  They don't feel super sturdy as the metal bends some, but my stainless steel drinking straws are bent and it aids in cleaning around the curve.  I figure they'll last at least a year if not longer if I'm careful and are definitely worth the purchase."
"Since these rugs are reversible, there is no sticky backing and are slippery on the bathroom floor.  They're well constructed, but are very thick.  I don't know that they are going to dry out after use."
"What tremendous insight from the hardest working reporter in all the WORLD.  His experience and know-how is unparalleled and his unique ability to penetrate to the heart of all subjects is inspiring.  A MUST READ!!!!!!"
"I works perfectly. Better than I expected!I record all of my songs and it records like a professional one!!!"
"Sound so good an look real pretty sitting next to my other instruments. I wrote a song with my guitar and added the bongos to jazz it up and its perfect"
"This product was a really good deal for the quality (super sharp clean cut with a large and small hole). I've always had problems with sharpeners but this one hasn't failed me yet!"
"These screen protectors were perfect for my iPhone 5! Everything lined up nicely and it was really easy to apply. These are probably the best screen protectors I used so far."
"Gorgeous color, however runs big in areas and super tight in the arm area. I'm 5'4 and 130 lbs but the arms on my elbow were beyond tight. Cute but wish I didn't get it due to the fit."
"What a bad design. With wet hands and a moving toddler there is no easy way to use this as you have to try and grip the side or bottom. They should have included a handle. Plus, the rubber that is supposed to form around the child's head when you poor is too stiff and water just gets in their eyes anyways. Lastly. when trying to use the sprinkler function unless you poor really slowly the water just runs over the lip. Not much good to say about what should be such a simple product."
"While the book is compellingly entertaining from the start to the finish. It never really hits home on the issues it raises at the beginning. A disillusioned corporate sellout taking on the powers behind the world's biggest conspiracies should deliver so much more than this short piece did.Nonetheless, if youre after a strange, hilariously entertaining and at points depraved quickie, Eggman is your man."
"Well... I regret reading this book now. Because now I probably have to wait way to long for the sequel! That's just mean! I want it! I want it now!*Ahem* I guess you could say that I liked this book. No actually I didn't like it. I loved it! It was everything I hoped it to be and more! So So So SOOOOO AWESOME!The story starts almost right after the first book and the characters I fell in love with (some more than I should) or grew to hate so much (*cough*Celeste*cough*) are still here and I'm sooo happy! In this book we learn more about the history of the land through Diaries from Gregory Illea and we see a bit of a darker side of it. We get to know the King and Queen more in this book, which was awesome. I love Queen Amberly, she's so nice! But I hate the King. I really do. Almost as much as I hate Celeste, that *peeeeep*. Bleh.America is still awesome, even though maybe a little more emotional in this one. I get that I was too. I was so torn and I am just reading the book. If I were America, I would be crying all the time. But she is still true to herself and never forgets were she comes from and she isn't afraid to fight for what she thinks is right. And I'm glad she has support from some people in the palace. Now why is she so torn? Guys of course...Maxon... Sigh. My emotions were scrambled up good in this book, and that's mainly because of him. First I still love him, than I don't like him so much, than I do, than I hate him, and in the end I loved him again. Yeesh... I mean... I get that he needs to find a wife, but if he really loves America, like he says, why kissing those other girls? Okay yeah, sometimes America is to blaim for that one to because she pushes him away constantly (something I don't understand by the way... I would never push him away), but come on Maxon... Kissing Celeste? Seriously? If I could I would kick you right in your royal parts. But I can't stay mad at him for long, so...And then there's Aspen. Yeah he's a douchebag but at least he is a one-woman kind of guy and he fights for America. Something I admire. And it's romantic... So you see why America is so torn? I certainly am... But I still think I'm team Maxon.Oh and I love her dad! He made me cry quite a bit in this book with those letters he wrote to America. Wish I had a dad like that.And Marlee... I'm soooo not going to talk about her. I'll cry again.So yeah, this was awesome. I loved it. I want the sequel."
"Oh my god... This book was incredible. A truly compelling story with fascinating creatures, realistic characters and a mind-blowing romance. And really the only thing that I didn't like was the big info dumps you get sometimes but I'm willing to look past that just for Ink. Sigh. My Ink.Normally this is the part where I give a short summary of the story but with this book I can't do that without telling you the whole thing and make it one giant spoiler. So I'm going to skip that part just to talk about the book itself. First off all, great writing. Dawn managed to suck me in right from the first page and she didn't let me go until the book was finished. Even now, an hour after finishing it, I'm still in the story with my head. It was so fascinating and wonderful. I love this book. But like I said, I got some big info dumps and while it was all very interesting and I wanted to know more the first time, but after a few of those dumps, I was kinda like... ""Hmm. Okay. So when am I going to get more of Ink and Joy?""Ink and Joy. God, I love those two. They were so compelling and realistic and just awesome. Their relationship was a bit bumpy at the beginning, no wonder if you see how it started. Joy gets sucked into his world without even realizing what is going on just because of a mistake Ink made. And nobody else can see him so that makes it all the more complicated. But you feel the tension between them and after a while, I felt tense too every time there was a scene were they were so close to the romance-part. I waited long for the real romancy stuff to kick in and when it did... I felt like I was melting inside with the tension and everything. I constantly felt like I was about to faint when Ink and Joy were together. I felt lightheaded and compelled and it took my breath away every single time.I loved Joy. She handled all this in a way that I can relate too. And she has some serious family stuff to deal with next to all that mysterious stuff. She was nice to read about and she's a fun main-character. And Ink. God... He was so compelling and I had a strange connection with him. Weird to say, but I did. He was such an amazing character and it was so interesting to see him learning to feel like a human and I felt for him. It wasn't hard to like him. Same with his sister, Inq and Joy's friend Monica. And her dad. He's such a great dad.And then the end. The last 40 something pages. Ooooh my god I was on the edge of my seat screaming and getting heart attacks and asthma and everything. And again, Ink and Joy... Swoon, Sigh, Faint, Die. I still feel tense.Now this is a book where I wouldn't have minded if there was insta-love. I would've understood it 100% just because of Ink. But I loved the tension and everything. I loved the feels I got from this book. So I recommend it to everyone. This is an amazing book. It really is."
"So... good vampires, bad vampires, soulmates, witches,... Haven't heard that before... I expected it to be bad, honestly. It didn't seem all that original with the vampire-loves-human-thing, but I am so glad that this book wasn't what I expected for once. Because this was a really good book. Wait... What am I saying? It's not good. Not at all. IT'S AWESOME!Yeah you saw that right. This is an awesome book. And you know what? It actually turned out to be pretty damn original. I love the vampires in this book and the whole soulmate-thing. Throw in a witch and your settled for a good time reading this book. The writing is also great. I mean, seriously. Ashley has a way with words and when I read this book she kept me guessing until the end. I loved the mysteries and unanswered questions that hooked me to the story. Good job Ashley!I love Amelia. She's awesome. Yeah, she had a hard life and she had a lot to deal with but she's also a stubborn, strong young woman and she doesn't like to be controlled. (Unlike some other characters in vampire-books... *cough*) She fights the bond even though it may hurt her and I like that about her. And in the end, she learns why her life was as s***ty as it was. So yeah, great main character: CHECK!Of course I loved Mitchel and Angelle and Eric and Luke and... All of them. The good guys were great and the bad guys were great. It's all great. Awesome awesome fantastic!I will read the next books in the series as soon as I've finished the other R2R-books, ARC's,... that are screaming at me from my TBR-mountain. (Yes mountain. Not a list, not a pile, a mountain.) ""Shut up! I'll read you as soon as I can, okay? Yeesh..."" Books these days..."
"I got through this book pretty quick and it was pretty good. It has the right amount of action mixed with romance. But something didn't really wow me. The writing was also good, so that's not the issue. I didn't really connect with the characters and I don't know why because I actually liked them. Hmm... I'm so torn! I wanted to like this book so much because it seemed so great and it is pretty good, but I guess something just didn't connect me to the novel. Weird. Maybe this isn't really my type of book.If you love this genre, I really recommend it! It's a great book and fans of the genre will love it. I'm just not a big fan of action and stuff. :P Anyways, since this isn't a bad novel it deserves 3 stars!"
"Surah and Charlie are the main characters here and they live in the world from The Alexa Montgomery Saga (which I really recommend by the way) and their story is set after the events from those books. That is just one thing that makes this book awesome. My expectations were really high for this one. H.D. did an amazing job on Alexa's story and I didn't think she could live up to that. I hoped for it, but I didn't think she would. And she didn't let me down. This book is beyond awesome.At first, Surah reminded me of Jasmine (you know, from Aladdin). She was a princess that didn't want to be a princess anymore with a huge tiger as a pet and best friend and she falls in love with a common boy. So I guess Charlie is kind of like Aladdin too. But Jasmine didn't have lavender hair and eyes and cool magic powers and she wasn't hundreds of years old. Surah is one kickass heroine. She can kick some as but at the same time, she struggles with the doubts within herself. Will she be what her father expects her to be? Or will she go her own way?Charlie was so cute and sweet! He has been in love with Surah for years. (Centuries actually.) He even wrote a song for her! Gosh, I want my own Charlie. *swoon*Do I even have to tell you how awesome Samson is? No. You know he is, even if you haven't read the book yet.I don't like Michael, he's an ass and for some reason I don't like Theo either. I just have a bad feeling about that guy.This story doesn't have a slow start. H.D.'s books never really have. She doesn't wait to start the action, she just does it. I love her so much. She is such an incredible writer and an amazing storyteller. She has a way with words that I can't describe. Every time I finish a book, I just sit in my chair for a moment. Speechless.On of the best things of this book? The romance. There is no insta-love here! Not at all. Charlie and Surah have been in love with each other for centuries (even though they have a hard time admitting that). I wouldn't exactly call that insta-love, would you? They are so sweet together and when Charlie sang that song to Surah, the hopeless romantic in me rejoiced.So long story short, this book is great. The world, the characters, the story. It is everything I wanted and more. Much more. Thank you H.D. for yet another amazing book. And hurry up on the sequel, please?"
"Jep, 3 stars. That's right. That's a pretty high rating for an angel book coming from me. But then again, this is not an ordinary angel book. And still I missed something in it. I think I, as always, expected more.So this is the story of Rosa. She is a hunter, a pretty good one actually. I liked her. She was a cool main character. I liked Jason and I liked the two of them together. Now, I don't exactly know what I missed in this book... Maybe I wanted a little more action? Maybe it's the end that disappointed me? I don't know. I only know that there was something missing in this book. The writing was okay. Pretty good, but not great either. The book overall was pretty average. Maybe it just isn't my thing. If you're a fan of angel books, you'll most likely like this book too. If not, you might not like this one, but then again, this is just my opinion."
"3.5 stars!Okay, I liked this story! I didn't really love it, but I liked it! And The Devil's Tattoo has got to be the coolest bandname ever. Seriously.Zoe Granger started playing guitar ever her heart was broken into a million pieces. And music has been her escape ever since. Then her best friend Dee suggest they start a band and everything goes quick after that. They call themselves The Devil's Tattoo and after releasing their first EP, it's on top of the sharts in no time. Contracts, photo shoots, interviews,... Everything has changed in such a short amount of time. Then they're asked to tour with the hot indie band The Stabs. Will is the bass player of that band and he only has eyes for Zoe, but Zoe doesn't trust guys that easy and she doesn't want her heart broken again. But Will is determined. This tour is either going to be a highway to hell or a stairway to heaven.I liked the story. It's really cool! I love music and this is pretty realistic. Things can go very quick very sudden and I liked that! The writing was good too, although it was a bit fast in the beginning and I didn't quite understand the situation between Will and Zoe because of that. It seemed like insta-love, but it wasn't. It just seemed that way because of the fact that we skip through a couple of months in the first few chapters. But it got better once they started the tour and even though I liked those two together, I kind of wanted Zoe to fall for her best friend because they were so funny together! Their conversations are hilarious and they seem like a married couple after 30 years of marriage. Seriously cool. The whole band is that way. It's like a family and I love that!I liked the characters. Zoe is cool and I get where she comes from. And I adore Dee, he's just awesome. I really liked all of them and I'm happy that I got to know them!If you love books about bands and music and friendship and all that, you'll probably like this one too. So try it out! Maybe it's something for you!"
"My first thought after finishing this book was: `Wow, this is a comic in book form.' And that's not a bad thing. Absolutely not. I love comics with superheroes and all that stuff. And I read this pretty quick. Got through it in less than 3 hours.This book is about Jim, a teenage boy with super powers. He moonlights as a Super Bounty Hunter under the name Mohawk and he's also known as Kid Sensation. He got into the trials of the Academy, a place where all teen with powers go to see if they can become a superhero. And because of some super ass he didn't get a chance to enter even though he was qualified.I enjoyed this book because I love all things superhero (Marvel, DC Comics, ... that sort of stuff. And elements. Let' s not forget those). Yeah, I'm a geek. But it was not really that special for me. It had a few flaws, which brought the book down a lot. It was a bit confusing with the flashbacks too. The writing was okay but there were some typos. I didn't have to think that much while reading and sometimes that's not a bad thing. But when there was a flashback, that changed and I was confused because I didn't immediately got the fact that it's a flashback. I do like the cover, it gives the book the whole comic book vibe I got when I finished it.I liked the characters, but there were cliches. I don't mind a few, but in this book, there were quite a lot of them. Overall this is a good book to read when I'm lazy and just want to put my mind off things and have a good time. It's that sort of book. And there's nothing wrong with that."
"Actual rating: 3,5 starsThe Grave Winner is Lindsey's first book and yes, I noticed that sometimes in this book, but I always take that into consideration when I read because everyone makes beginners mistakes. So I tried not to pay to much attention to those. But overall this was a good debut. It was funny (hilarious at times), creepy, mysterious and just a fun read. I definitely had a good time reading it. And I'm still itchy by the way Lindsey. Nice thing you did there. Lol.I loved Leigh, she was very witty and I was really laughing out loud at times. And sarcastic. That was very relatable because my humor is usually very sarcastic to. I loved Jo and Sarah, even though Sarah was a little creepy at times... I liked Tram and Cal and all the other characters.This really is a good ghost story and a perfect book to read around Halloween (other times too, but it really reminded me of a book for Halloween, so...) Oh and I love the cover, fits the story very nice."
"1.5 starsIf you've been reading my reviews for a while now, you know angel books can be a hit or a miss for me. This was not a hit, unfortunately. Though the blurb and the cover make it look and sound like a great book, it wasn't for me. Not at all.I'm not going to waste anytime giving a short summary of the book. This book was so frustrating and those were the longest 200 pages ever. It didn't seem to end and while that is a good thing with some books, it wasn't for this one. I couldn't wait for it to end. The writing was... not good. Not even okay. This book needs a good editor. Some things just sounded ridiculous. And I didn't feel anything throughout the book. Part of that was probably because of the characters, which I'll explain in a minute. The book was a bit boring too. Nothing really happened until the second half of the book and by then it already lost my interest. Some of the action scenes weren't that bad, but still. It took a whole lot more to make me love the book. Or even like it.The events in this book take place over just a few days and despite that the romance in this book is insta-love. Sigh. I'm starting to hate it. With a passion. Seriously. Especially in this book. Again, the characters. Okay, let's just get straight to it.I was never so frustrated by characters before. Not even Bella from Twilight. I'm serious. Even though her name is Emma Wise, she certainly isn't wise or smart. And no depth at all. The book starts out when they're bringing her in the hospital after a horrible car crash in which her parents died. It's a miracle she even survived. The next day, they tell her she's moving to Alaska the next day to some aunt. You'd think that she'd mourn the loss of her parents, but noooo. She's angry because she has to leave her friends and stuff behind. And the next day, Kade comes to pick her up. She's instantly in love with him. Again, her parents just died two days ago and she thinks about the boy and how hot he is? -Sigh- Then they leave for alaska and on the plane Kade tells her she'll be homeschooled and that makes her angry again because that's not fair and she can't spend her senior year being homeschooled. And blah blah blah. No emotions. At all.Then there are the best friends. One of the things her friend asks is: What happened to your cell? At that point, I was screaming to my e-reader. Your best friend just miraculously survived a deadly car crash. What the hell do you think happened to her cell phone? Ugh.Is it normal in the US that people who miraculously survived a deadly car crash can leave the hospital and go on a plane the next day? I don't know that but it sounds pretty stupid.There have never been so much caps in my notes before. So yeah, I was frustrated a lot reading this book and I am so so SO happy I finished it because I never thought I would. So I'm sorry, but I can't say that I recommend this book to anyone. I guess if you love angel books, you might as well give it a try because I want to know if there is anyone who shares my opinion. Sigh."
"3.5 starsI liked this book! :) As you may or may not know, I have a weakness for books/movies about people with elemental powers, so this one belongs on that list too. It wasn't the best ever and sometimes the romance between Ryan and Natalie seemed a bit... rushed. It almost is one of those instant-love thingies you often read in books nowadays. And I'm not really a fan of that. But overall this was a fun book and I liked it. I really did. And I would read the sequel because I want to know what happens next.ARC courtesy of the author.

"Well, Heather... You've done it again. This was one hell of a book. Mind-blowing, all-consuming, can't-look-away-even-if-I-tried, breathtaking, heart-pounding,... Words just aren't enough to describe what I think of this book. It was all that and more. Especially the romance. Well... I expected it actually. Having read all but one of H.D. Gordon's books, I knew it would be awesome. And it sure was. Damn.Falling Stars starts right where Shooting Stars left off. Now I can't tell too much about it because of spoilers, so I'll just say that Surah and Charlie are in for a breathtaking romance and a whole lot of trouble. This series is starting to prove itself to be just as epic as the Alexa Montgomery Saga was.Just as in all the other books, the writing was awesome. Heather has a way of pulling me into a story and never letting me go. Not even for a second. I was right there with Surah and Charlie and even Samson. I felt like I was a part of their journey. And what a journey it was. Just the right amount of action and the romance... I'll say it again... Damn. My heart stopped several times over the course of this book only to pound a hundred times faster when it started back up again. And it literally made me gasp at some points. Not just the romance, but the whole book. I love how I'm pulled into each and every book Heather wrote and feel so many things. And I loved the fact that we got some chapters from Samson's Point of view. He is without a doubt the most awesome pet animal.I think it's safe to say that Surah is one of the most awesome characters ever. She's no spoiled princess that needs a knight in shining armor to help her when she's in trouble. Surah can handle herself, and how. She can seriously kick some ass. And I love for that. The most awesome princess ever. (With the most awesome pet ever.) And Charlie... Charlie. I can't think of him without getting a big fat smile on my face and a deep sigh. Though he, too, can kick serious ass, he's also very sweet and caring and just... perfect in my eyes. I love him. And it's pretty obvious I love Samson too. But I hate Michael and actually... I hate Theo too. Just don't like him.One last thing before I end this review... What is up with that ending Heather? Seriously??? Are you kidding me? I'm sure somewhere in the world this is a form of torture. Just... Just give me the next book okay? Like... Yesterday.Fans of H.D. Gordon will love this book. And people who haven't read anything from her yet... Well I suggest you better get started. Read the Alexa Montgomery Saga first. It's not necessary but you'll understand some things in these series better when you do. If you love fantasy and an amazing romance, I highly recommend Heather's books!"
"2.5 starsAlthough this book started strong and had an emotional moment towards to end, most of the time I was just bored. Most books in this genre are basically the same, but it&amp;#8217;s the way it&amp;#8217;s executed that matters. And I&amp;#8217;m really sorry that I have to say this, but this one was just not that good for me personally.Ember&amp;#8217;s world comes crashing down on her when she learns her father has died in Afghanistan. Her mother becomes a zombie and she&amp;#8217;s the one that has to keep everything together. And than her jerk of a boyfriend, Riley becomes the most hated person for me in this book and the only one Ember can find comfort in is Josh. It&amp;#8217;s a pretty standard story, but it felt so long and I was so bored through most of it. The beginning was so good. The first few chapters had me in tears, but when Josh came along, I lost that connection. In the end is a moment that was very emotional and I had tears in my eyes from it, but for the rest I just didn&amp;#8217;t care. And I think the problem for me is with the characters.Ember is not a great character, but she&amp;#8217;s okay. She has to take care of her brother and sister and mom after her father&amp;#8217;s dead. And she&amp;#8217;s okay. But her mom. In the first half of the book she&amp;#8217;s practically a zombie. She does nothing but sleep and she doesn&amp;#8217;t care anymore. I get it, she&amp;#8217;s sad and I&amp;#8217;ve been there, but she has responsibilities! She has kids to take care of! Ember shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to change her whole life just because her mom doesn&amp;#8217;t want to do anything anymore! And Ember&amp;#8217;s grandmother comes to help, but she doesn&amp;#8217;t do much either. April is&amp;#8230; I don&amp;#8217;t know. Just okay I guess. She goes off the rails for a bit but that&amp;#8217;s it. Her little brother Gus is the one I cared about the most. In the beginning of the book, the first chapter, Ember has to tell him their father died. This is a bit from that moment.&amp;#8220;Daddy isn&amp;#8217;t coming home, Gus.&amp;#8221;Little blue eyes filled with tears, and his lower lip began to quiver. &amp;#8220;Did the bad guys get him?&amp;#8221;It broke my heart! I felt so sad for that little guy! But he was the only one I really felt something for. Josh was also okay. He&amp;#8217;s exactly what I expected him to be. He&amp;#8217;s Gus&amp;#8217; hockey coach and he and Ember went to the same school for a while years ago. The romance between him and Ember is just&amp;#8230; weird. It started weird and I didn&amp;#8217;t feel a connection to them so I think that&amp;#8217;s why the book was so boring to me. And then you have Riley and Kayla. Ember&amp;#8217;s boyfriend and best friend. They&amp;#8217;re stupid. He&amp;#8217;s an ass and a dick. And he&amp;#8217;s pathetic. And Kayla&amp;#8217;s a bitch. Why? Well, it&amp;#8217;s not really a spoiler because it happens in the beginning, but I&amp;#8217;ll hide it anyway. -SPOILER- Riley doesn&amp;#8217;t show up at the funeral and a weeks after it he has a party and Ember goes to surprise him, (Josh was so kind to give her a ride) and there she finds him sleeping with Kayla. Like actual sex. And she finds out they&amp;#8217;ve been doing it for a year. The worst thing about it, is that Ember and Riley had been together for three years and they had their whole life planned out. And Riley wanted to wait until they were married before they had sex. She didn&amp;#8217;t want to, he did. And he has the words excuses for it. And he comes begging for her forgiveness throughout most of the book and I just wanted to hit him so hard. And the night she finds all that out, is also the night she just starts everything with Josh. Which is why it&amp;#8217;s weird. Her dad just died, she just broke up with her cheating boyfriend after three years and then she immediately wants to have sex with him. That&amp;#8217;s just weird. -END SPOILER-In the end it just didn&amp;#8217;t do it for me. I was bored most of the time and except for a few emotional moments involving Ember&amp;#8217;s dad, I didn&amp;#8217;t really feel anything. I would recommend it to fans of the genre. Maybe you&amp;#8217;ll love it! I hope you do! So give it a shot!"
"This book was so good! I can't wait for the next one! Such a cliffhanger and a great read! Love!"
"Are you tired of your life? Do you do things that don't bring any meaning in to your life? Are you so busy that you have never thought of these questions before? Do you own a Ferrari? You can spend couple of hours reading this book and might find the answers to your questions or you can keep on rushing and realize these things by yourself on the last day of your life!Robin Sharma is really a great story teller. The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is a book full of wisdom, advises and lessons about life wrapped in a beautiful story of human transformation and finding a meaning in life. I liked this book, because everything is explained in a simple story way. The main line of the book is about the lawyer who had all the success and lots of money but still lost the meaning and passion in life. Author tells us simple principles which most people forget by rushing over their lives. He reminds us what it really means to live and enjoy everyday blessings. All the book consists of many insights and advises presented in a ear-catching manner.Most people these days rush to make careers, earn money and does other &amp;#34;need to do&amp;#34; things don't even realizing that they are quitting on their real dreams and passions in life. Most people are just doing things not even realizing that they are caught in a closed circuit and really don't go anywhere. Most people are not happy with their lives and those things they are doing are not bringing them any joy. Most people are trying their best for their family, but forgetting the most important - to spend time with the family. This book might be the answer to the question, why are they not happy yet. Happiness is a state of mind that consists of many small blessings in life and most people are just rushing for many things that don't make their lives any more happy and meaningful.  This book might open your eyes and make you see life through a different angle.As hearing some people talking about this book I also noticed one dangerous thing. And that thing is money topic. For some people it might seem that money is not an important thing, but it really is and I don't believe that Robin wants to justify poverty. Money is a tool, to make your life easier and get things you want and you don't need to misunderstand the attitude that money becomes everything in life. Believe me, if you don't have money, happiness is a lot more difficult state to understand. Even the book is called The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, so you need to have that Ferrari at first in order to be able to sell it. This book is not a permission to make excuses why you are not rich or have not enough money. It just gives you lessons on how to be happy and live a meaningful life.So what car do you drive and which car would you really like to drive?!"
"Most people would say that love is very important in their life and relationship, but how many people really know what love is? Most people don't even have any idea how to love themselves and they already try to love others. Most people are trained how to love by their parents, surroundings and most people don't even realize that the real intimacy of two souls starts in a much different place and proceeds in a much different way!I believe that discovering yourself should be the main task in any person's life! And Paulo Coelho is a master at writing great novels on this topic. It's his second book that I've got a chance to read and I am really very happy that I did so. As I loved The Alchemist, I loved this book even more, but I still think that you should read The Alchemist first!This book caught my attention from the start and I couldn't wait to see what will happen going further through the pages. Every page of the book got my attention until the book was finished. Author touches many interesting themes in this book like love, marriage, fame, obsession, transformation, loss, discovery and journey into yourself. I was really impressed on author's point of view about love in this book. This book even could be read as an amazing and dramatic love story with a happy ending. It could also be read as a discovery of yourself, transformation of human soul. Or it could be read as everything mentioned above. That's the beauty of this story, it is not just a nice love story, but it's also a very deep and philosophical analysis of human behavior and soul.The main line of the book is about the main character who is looking for his lost wife. The story starts from him being arrested for suspicion of being related to his wife's disappearance. The rest of the book is a journey of a great search for his wife. It just a very short description of the book, but everything is more complicated. It's not just a journey to find his wife, it's a journey to discover the real himself as well. The journey into realizing real love, attraction and real intimacy of two souls.I would greatly encourage everyone to read this book. It doesn't matter if you are single, married, divorced or living together for 20 boring (or maybe exciting) years. I believe, that if you read this book with open heart, you will find a lot of spices to make your life and relationship more wonderful than you could have imagined before.So, what is your Zahir?"
"This book is for everyone chasing their dreams. It's about amazing will, persistence, love and finally great success. Chris Gardner is the man who became millionaire from scratch. He experienced dark and cold nights, homelessness and many more struggles but finally made it to a very successful person. Here, in this book, he is sharing his experience and gives us 44 lessons in life, which can lead us to great success despite of where we are right now!It's the same author who wrote the book ""The Pursuit Of Happyness"". I haven't read that book, but saw the movie based on it. I believe many of you did and if not, I greatly recommend you to do so. I loved the movie, so when I saw this book I had no doubts I should read it. I wasn't wrong, this book is really impressive and it really gives you simple but very powerful lessons for life. Many people struggle in life having no clue where to start and Start Where You Are would be a great choice to start with.Chris covers everything, starting from the circumstances where everybody are at the moment then going on to the past experiences, mastery, simple everyday steps, spirituality and finally to the lessons of really happy life.Most of the lessons in similar or different words I got from other books I've read before. What I liked the most about this book is that all the necessary lessons are really clearly distinguished in one book. Everything is explained in simple words and thoughts. Moreover, this book is not about finances and money. Chris does say that money is important in life, but he talks about it just as a result of happy life. So in this book you can find everything what can be called a really happy life.Do you have any other lessons of happy life? Share with others!"
"Genetics is nothing to blame on! If your weight shows numbers that you don't like, it's your job to reduce them. Your body is a very serious part of your life and you should treat it accordingly. Sex? Well, we all believe that we know everything, but a little more knowledge about 15 minute woman orgasm would be a great deal, don't you think so?!Timothy Ferriss is really a great author and a person who likes to analyze and experience things and later on present the conclusions to us. I haven't read his bestseller The 4-Hour Workweek yet, but when reading The 4-Hour Body you can feel that author experienced everything, what he writes about, himself. That's very interesting, because all the advices are based on experiments, experiences, tests and numbers. Timothy loves numbers and tests and I believe that's great, because most things and progresses should be measured and most of them are measured by numbers. What you need is to know what those tests and numbers mean and how to interpret them and Timothy explains everything in his book.This book is about what I would call self-performance, what includes losing fat, improving sex life, getting better sleep and seeking for other improvements in physical abilities. You should never forget that human consists of body, mind and heart (or soul) and all of these areas should be trained equally in a period of life! So this book is mostly about body, though I believe that if you are improving one area of your humanization, at certain degree the other areas are improving as well.There are many books written on dieting, exercising, building muscles, losing fat, having better sex and sleep  and so on. I believe all of them provide certain information on a subject they are written. It's not just another book on similar subjects. What I love about it the most is that Timothy tries to explain most processes happening in/to the body in an easy to understand way why you should do that. Another excellent thing is that all above mentioned topics and many more are covered in one book! Moreover, he doesn't say that you should change your personality completely to lose weight or to improve your abilities. He doesn't suggest any radical changes in your daily eating or living habits, he simply suggests what I would call an improvement. There is no easy or hard way to lose fat or improve your other body abilities. The are only few things that should be done in order to achieve your goals. And this book provides you with one of the methods. You might like it or not, but it works! Everything depends just on you. Reading the book is just 10% of the work, the rest 90% is your part in putting that knowledge in to action!I believe The 4-Hour Body will provide you with experienced information on many facilities of your physical being. It's worth reading, but just if you are going to take an action afterwards!So, do you think your body deserved at least 4 hours of excellent treatment?"
"Ever wondered why some things become so popular and others, even better, just vanish? Probably everybody who has an access to the computer on this planet saw PSY video Gangnam style and wondered how it's possible that an unknown musician became so very well known and popular in all over the world so quickly? Well, me too, and after reading this Malcolm's book I've got my answers.After reading one of Malcolm's books' called Outliers I found another called The Tipping Point. I liked his first book, so I was pretty sure that this one is going to be very interesting as well. I wasn't wrong. The book is really great because of author's style and ability to put a lot of examples and experiments into the material. That's what makes his works a little different from others what I've been recently reading.The Tipping Point tries to explain why some things (products, fashions, behavior, etc.) become like viruses and spread in amazing speed and volume and why others don't. Even it might look like an accident, it's not, everything has a logical and analytically explanation. This means that everything might be planed and done in a controlled manner. The tipping point is the point, when everything changes and becomes unstoppable viral.According to Malcolm, there are three main factors that play the main role in reaching tipping point and creating a viral effect and he explains them separately in a very understandable way. Author analyzes many cases based on viral impact what leads us to more deep understanding about the cases and the factors. After reading this book it's easier to understand how many commercials are done or marketing companies work. Not all of them are doing this successfully, but some are. It's not enough to know how to do viral effect, but it's still a good start to know that it's possible to do in a controlled manner. It's not fortune anymore, it's just some methods that are already analyzed and being implemented.Moreover, this knowledge can help in a lot of good things, because sometimes bad behavior becomes viral and the only way to stop it effectively is to know how everything works. Knowing that it's possible to spread another virus, which can neutralize the first one or simply not to let bad behavior reach tipping point and become viral.I can't wait to implement The Tipping Point knowledge into my business.Any viral thoughts:)?"
"Have you ever been cheated or tricked? Have you ever put so much trust in somebody but eventually it turned out that he/she lied to you? Do you like the feeling of being fooled? I believe you don't!This book is about lies. Before I started to read it I couldn't think that it's possible to write whole book on such topic, but I found out that there are many more books about lies. That surprised me in the beginning, but getting deeper into the pages I realized that it's really a very wide and important topic in our lives. I thought that I never lie, but it turned out that I do, just mostly all of my lies fall into the category of acceptable lies. You will find many interesting information like classification of lies and liars, the accuracy of polygraph, biggest lies in history and many more.There are things that I liked and disliked in this book. The good thing about reading Paul's book is that I really learned a lot of new things and information. Before reading it I just knew that people lie, now I know a lot more about psychology and science of lie. Yes, you can really call it science! I don't mean that I learned everything written in the book, but I can see a bigger picture on this topic now. Another thing that I liked is examples about real historical events. They really made reading more interesting. One more thing that I paid attention to is that author don't claim things, he just says his opinion, results of the experiments and facts beside. That makes it more real, than just to know someone's opinion and take it for absolute truth.What I missed in this book is more pictures of human expressions with different emotions. There are some, but I think it would be more interesting to see more emotions and more different people feeling the same emotion. Reading this book felt like it is more adapted to catch criminals lying. I've missed more examples and information on business lies.I understand, this book is dedicated to see the big image on lie topic. It's not a learning tutorial. So probably my dislikes are not very countable. Anyway, it's a great book on quite an interesting topic. If you are interested in body language, mentalism or seeking the truth, you should read this book.What's your opinion on lying?"
"It's sick.It's creepy.It's disgusting.It's unethical.It's psycho.It's mentally ill.It's pervert.All of these epithets might suit to describe this book. I think some people might not even read it fully.The author, Chuck Palahniuk, can really write intriguing and creepy plots for the stories. I'm not too much into novel, but as I liked ""Fight Club"", written by the same author, I decided to read this book as well. I can say, Chuck really surprised me with this book. I didn't expect it to be so sick. Of course it depends on the attitude, of how sick you see it, but even for me thinking to have a wide attitude, the story was pervert. And I don't mean pervert in a sexual way, I mean pervert in mind way.The story basically concentrates on few young people having everything in their lives. What I liked the most, that the author shows what is happening in their heads, but this is fully revealed only in the end of the book. One of the main quotes of the book is: ""Everything we want is what we are trained to want"". And only reading this book fully you can see to what sick thoughts, actions and consequences it could a damaged mind bring to.If you think you can imagine all freaky-pervert show, you should really read this one!"
"I wish I have read this book 10 or even 5 years earlier. Principles told in this book is taken from long time ago and they still have a big value on these days. Now I can see exactly why i didn't make or had money at some times in my life, I think you will see too.The Richest Man in Babylon is written in a story telling style, that makes this book very easy to read and very easy to understand. In my mind some principles told shouldn't be taken straight, some of them you should adapt to nowadays. World seems to change, but the rules of money making and having still are the same.I encourage you to read this book, practice principles and I believe your finances will get much much better."
"Most people wonder why certain people are successful and others are not, even though all of them are trying hard. I bet you wondered that many times as well? There is no any magic or mystery! There are certain habits that successful and effective people have and others don't. And you are able to know all of them in this one amazing book.This book was released 25 year ago and I can't believe that so many people still don't know those essential 7 habits of effectiveness and success. Anyway, it's still very great to have such book at home where you can find very valuable information about how to become highly effective in your life. And I believe many people seek that knowledge, but many might not know where to get the correct one. This book will uncover 7 essential habits for every one of you to become highly effective and successful!I've read this book twice and am really impressed with the information Stephen presents us. He believes that to become highly effective person in life you need to master 7 habits. Habits - because everything we are used to do is a habit, but not all our habits help us in life. In the beginning the author describes what a habit is and why it is important to develop them if you want to have a meaningful and successful life. That means that if you have some useless habits you will have to change them to useful ones if you want to live a better life.Latter on Covey tells what those 7 habits are. He explains what it means to be dependent, independent and what it means to be interdependent and which habit makes you reach those levels. I was really amazed by the simplicity of the information. It's very easy to start using it in everyday life, still to master those 7 habits you will need efforts, but there is only one way to become effective and successful in life.I highly recommend you to read this book if you are not as effective and successful as you want to be. Even if you think that you are successful enough I believe this book will help you to reach even higher. After reading The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People you will see which areas needs to be improved and there are other great literature on improving any of those fields and then everything is up to you!Do you have any other advises for the effectiveness?"
"Richard Branson - one of the most brilliant entrepreneurs in today world. He managed to create very successful businesses in many areas like music, airways, space trips, trains, mobile operators and many more by establishing Virgin company.

Richard is one of my most inspiring personalities and this book is exactly what you need to start making your dreams come true.Screw It, Let's Do It covers everything you need to make successful business and enjoy the processes all the way. I've read almost all of Richard's books and even though I didn't get any more knowledge of his life journey in this book, it's still a very good reading to summarize everything I've read in his previous books. It's short, it's simple, it's interesting to read and it has everything you need to start dream building and believing in your even the most crazy ideas.The book is called under the most favorite Richard's expression and it represents the action mode. One of the things that brought Branson to billionaires is action, and Screw It, Let's Do It explains it all. I remember times in my life when I was delaying things and that didn't bring anything good. If I have told myself &amp;#34;Screw it, let's do it&amp;#34; I believe many things would have turned out much better. Richard doesn't say that uncalculated risk is a good thing, but he says that if the risk is measured the the action should be brought in immediately. And he proves that by his achievements!What do you think? Do you delay things and regret about it later?"
"One of 2 my favorite movies. One of movies' classics masterpieces! I can still remember watching this movie almost 20 years ago, when it appeared on a big screens. Since then I watched Braveheart more than 10 times and every time watching I still get the same feeling as it was the first time. What made me such a huge impression? The simple answer would be - everything. The movie is really done brilliantly. Having in mind that it is almost 20 years old and it's impossible to compare it to today movies, but still this movie can compete with majority of the movies being made today. My second favorite movie is Avatar and I can say that Braveheart is the Avatar in those days.The story line is quite simple, but the implementation of it is astonishing. Mel Gibson did a great job combining all the components together to make Braveheart. The movie has everything: romance, freedom, fight, betrayal, love, will, persistence, idea, legacy and many more elements of life. It's impossible to describe this movie in any review. The only way to understand it is to watch it yourself. I believe, that there won't be anybody left with no feeling after this movie!"
"How good can you accomplish a task assigned to you? Ever wondered why some people simply get things done and the majority are just making themselves busy by looking for reasons not to do something? I'm sure you can find many answers to those questions by reading this short story!A Message To Garcia is a very short story written more than 100 years ago. The main purpose of it is to make you understand why there are so little people on this earth who can really accomplish the task. Most people can start or do something in some manner, but just the very few can really be trusted to finish the job without looking for excuses. The most beautiful thing about it is that everyone can choose by themselves to be that person. You don't need any native born skills or features. Actually you don't need anything extraordinary, just the right attitude which you choose by yourself! This book doesn't teach you anything, it just tries to make you think and choose your attitude.The story is relevant these days probably even more than it was 100 years ago, when it was written. Most people say that they want to get something first and only then they will do their best. I don't believe them. I saw many people, who get what they've asked for, but never do their best and probably never will. I believe that if you do your best, you will always be rewarded and I've proved that many times in my life.One of my principles in life is always to do my best whatever I do, and if I don't want or don't feel like doing my best, then I just quit that activity as fast as I can and start something where I can do my best. By reading this short story I realized that this principle was always very important despite the century people are living in. I really recommend you to read this book, not because you will be able to understand why so many people can't be trusted on tasks, but to change your own attitude and get things done immediately!Can you deliver a message to Garcia? Or will you just start questioning: why? who? where? ..?"

"Astonishing, breath-taking, mind-blowing story about the orphan who changed the world. I have to admit that this book was one of the thickest books I've ever read in my life. And in addition to that it was one of the most stunning book's I've ever read in my life.This book is biography of one of the most brilliant minds ever lived on earth. He is Steve Jobs. Everyone knows iPhone, iPad, iPod and many other devices created by Apple Inc. So in this book you can find all the life story of the man who played the main role in creating and developing those amazing technologies and the company itself. And this story isn't simple.I love this book because it's so involving and inspiring. I couldn't put it down since I first took it in my hands. Of course, I haven't read this book in one sip, but until I was finished I could think only about what's next. Another thing that fascinates me a lot, is that in this book there are a lot of dreams, struggles, challenges and victories. Jobs himself was a very difficult, but interesting personality. Some people hate him, some love, some do both, but there is none who don't have any of these feelings for him. His vision was huge, his dreams were unrealistic. Despite all of that, he made everything to make them come true.I greatly encourage you to read this book. If you have big dreams, huge visions, wish to succeed - Steve Jobs biography is a must read for you."
"You have to serve for the people - people who buy your products, people who work with you, people who you work for. Howard Behar is the man who made Starbucks the biggest coffee shops network in the world and now he shares his knowledge and experience with us.There is nothing much new or different from any other business success literature in this book. Howard shares his life journey while developing Starbucks into the biggest coffee chain in the world. He shares ten principles, which made his fortune. All those principles are pretty much the same as many successful people have. What I found different in this book is that Howard writes it from the perspective of people. Mostly he concentrates on all the people who make the business like customers, colleagues and employees. Author points out how important it is to listen to people around and act on other people's needs.It's Not About the Coffee made me to start looking more deep into people, analyze what they want and find a way to help them in what they need. It was a good reminder of the success principles as well, and mostly it helped me to realize how important people around you are. The book showed me that it's people who do the business. It's important to have a good product, but it's also very important to have and develop good team."
"Even though I admire Richard Branson very much, after reading this book I admire this person even more. Great man who changes the world and great book that can change your mindset and attitude towards the world. Richard is one of my teachers (through the books), and he really makes a big difference in my mind when reading all the experience this great man can provide me with. I believe, he can be a leader for many of you too!I love the way Richard Branson looks to the world and to the businesses. He is really very inspiring personality, who really has a lot of influence to my life. Business Striped Bare is not the first Richard's book I've got to read, I read almost all of his books and even had a chance to meet him. Since I've started to be interested in Richard my hunger to meet him started to grow. Now I have another dream, and it is to start some great project (business) with this amazing person and work with him together.This book really blew my mind. It's full of priceless advises which comes from experience of creating one of the biggest brands in the world - Virgin. It really opened my eyes to see more global things and to think more global. The book is distinguished into couple big chapters where Richard explains the most important parts of the business like right people, brand, trust and commitments, failures and learning from them, innovations, leadership and social responsibility. This last chapter really got my attention. I really love how Richard looks to the world from social spectrum. Even though some people might not agree with me, but this man is really changing the world into the better place. All the projects he describes in the book are really of great value (and I don't mean value in money). All the innovations Richard is trying to develop are so amazing that it really will change the face of the world in couple of years. That's where my mind stops to look at small things and tries to see big opportunities and really valuable (not just in money) things. We all can do something but after reading and understanding some of Richard's thoughts it becomes so strange to care about just any worthless thing.One of the things that really inspired me a lot was the board of old and very respectable people from the entire world. For those who have never heard of this, it's a group of people who meet to discuss the global problems of the world and none of them is politician or has any other interest except really big experience in life and a wish to make world a better place. This really made me to dream one day to be one of those people.Considering all above I can say that Business Striped Bare is a very strong book. I really recommend it to everyone who really are in business and want their business to grow big. Richard managed to create such an amazing empire and he really has so many advises which could be used to be successful. Epilogue of this book is even stronger and for the end of this review I would like to share one quote: ""It's possible to choose different ways in this life, and it's extremely important to choose the right one. And like it's not enough, it's not good choice to choose nothing, because such attitude to life really ensures failure"".So, tell me, what way in life do you choose?"

"Magic, mystery, illusion, tension, love and a beautiful story line make this movie really worth watching! I watched this film some time ago, but still can remember as one of the most interesting movies. Probably one of the things that made me love this film is the idea about mystery or in other words about illusionist. That kind of thing always was interesting to me. Moreover, this movie kept the tension and intrigue till the end. The most interesting part was that the main trick, the main illusion was going in a different way that a spectator could think of. I don't want to uncover the plot here, because it will be more interesting to watch it for yourself. I greatly recommend The Illusionist for everyone who likes mysteries and tangled plots."
"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen! Why? Because this movie has everything what you need for a spectacular view. Actors are not superstars, but it's the least important aspect in movie if you have everything else in it's places. The acting is great, special effects are superb, filming and directing has nothing more to add to. The story line is not new or something what you have never heard before in different interpretations. What I love is that even the story is simple, but the presentation and implementation of it is made the best way I could imagine!James Cameron is the director of this movie, and what I love about him is that he has an incredible ability to make masterpieces while many other directors can just make something. One of the most admirable things is that this movie, Avatar, changed the course of movies industry. James Cameron showed everyone that movies can be watched in 3D. He didn't invented 3D technology and I know that. Steve Jobs didn't invented many things too. What makes these 2 men similar and what makes me admire them and their works is the ability to make great masterpieces and change the course of history!I greatly recommend this movie to everyone!"
"Good reading about starting and developing business. I think this book really can serve you as a guide if you want to start your own business but don't know where and how to start. It covers important aspects like targeting your group, getting traffic, gathering information, selling, upselling and what it is very important - loving and relating to your customers. Daryl also talks about the importance of complains and how to handle them. What I really got from this book is that being the best in you sphere is not everything, being the best for your customers is everything.It's simple, easy readable and understandable and if you want to start you own business it's an excellent guide to use!"

"This model doesn't have the PS button on it so it makes it hard to use, and is impossible to use as the only controller as the PS button is heavily used. If only needing it as a secondary controller, it should work well enough."
"Great fit anyone that loves the stig, however the ones on the poster are not in the show. They are still really funny though."
"Great for a little kid. It allows them to build it, and then have a cute you to play with that they feel better about since they made it."
"It could use a stronger hanger and a better way to hold the hanger in place. If you have very heavy jewelry or a ton of it, might not be a good choice."
"Great case, but be weary of the corners, the have potential to crack and break or time with use. However, customer service is great and can get you a new one if that is the case. Love the color choices."
"Fits the phone perfectly, and protects it very well. The only thing I wish was better was the covering of the top and bottom of the phone, they are left exposed so potential to get dinged if not careful."
"We received different colors as shown above...bright orange with blue stitching, light blue with bright orange stitching and dark blue. They fit my 9 year old perfectly. He weighs about 66 pounds and around 48 inch tall. I got him size mediums and the fit is perfect. The material is a little thin, but he loves them. I will definitely buy these again."

"Brings back lots of memories!! I have known almost every answer!! Just stuck on a few, but with the help of friends, I get back on track quickly!"
"The previous reviewer didn't understand how this device is used. Though, I can't fault him too bad since it doesn't come with instructions. You are supposed to completely unscrew the top-cap bolt, and underneath is a larger bolt that expands the inner plug. Once you have the inner plug pressing against the inside diameter of the steerer tube, you can screw the top-cap in to actually preload the headset tension.On a metal steerer tube, you can then remove the whole thing if you wish, to save weight. On a carbon steerer, it is recommended to leave it in, so that you have something to counter the crushing force of the stem.Anyway, $8 shipped for a reusable plug that can set any material stem is definitely worth 5 stars."
"The right arm broke off within 20 minutes of having them.  I was not rough with them and they were not dropped.  The arm just.... Literally fell off.  So frustrating to pay over 100 dollars for these cheap china-made pieces of crap, wait for so long to get them, then they fall apart within 20 minutes when I'm going on vacation the next day.  Might as well get a five dollar pair from the gas station, they last longer.  I'd give it zero stars if I could."
"This is a great and equiped plasma cutter, works as well as an industrial plasma cutter, I just tried to cut a 1/2 "" sheet and it did it so easy, I suggest to anyone to buythis item if are looking for cheap prices and quality."

"I bought this gun because I had never seen a revolver air soft gun. Its very cheap but the quality of  the gun is worth a lot more. The aim is a little off. you have to aim a couple inches down. But Its a $50 gun, cant be perfect. I love and am buying another for my brother!"
"After reading the five books in the series, Richard Meier shows that the quality of modern architecture is the work of architectural space. The design from the inside out. So said Le Corbusier. Recommended every book of the collection for anyone who loves good architecture."
"great case for the $.My Daughter loves it.&amp; fits phone perfect.also arived ahead of time.also gives phone extra grip in your hand."
"Surprised at how cute and sturdy these were even though they are lightweight and collapsable.  They look wonderful and hold the cat and dog food so that it is more readily accesible.  Fits perfectly into the cubby storage organizer we bought.  Very satisfied."
"very nice, sturdy units that can be arranged in a number of ways to fit your storage needs.  This looks great on our washer/dryer and it looks so tidy and organized in there now!  Not too hard to put together. Only problem is we were sent smaller sections that I think were supposed to be for the backs, but were too small to fit."
"We have 3 girls in one bedroom and affording 3 matching bedding sets can be a daunting financial task!  However, these were extremely reasonable, and look very cute in the girls room.  No problems with them although they are not the very highest quality.  They are really great for the price."
"We were shopping for a light for a beautiful picture we'd gotten for Christmas, and were surprised at how expensive they were!  Then we came across this one and it was really reasonably priced, so we bought it.  It was shipped very quickly and turned out to be easy to install, high quality, looks great, and works perfectly to light up our picture.  Very satisfied."
"We were very impressed at the quality of this bedding.  It's heavy enough to keep you wam, but light enough not to suffocate you and cause you to overheat at night.  The pattern is gorgeous and the quality unsurpassed.  Great price too.  We are very satisfied."
"Menu selection is not intuitive.  Display is hard to see.For this price download device should be included.  That ability would increase functionality.Chest strap should have on off switch so you don't have to detach battery after each use.  This would mean one less thing to lose."
"First space heater I've ever owned.  But it does everything as advertised.  We have corner storage room that is very drafty - this knocks the chill off in 15 minutes."
"I wish I could get high quality jerky like this in the local store, and in larger quantities.  A tin of jerky would be great."
"I remember really liking this movie when it first came out and I thought I'd buy it and see what I thought of it now...I'm not the least bit disappointed!"
"Its an enjoyable read. I liked the cutaway views and history. Though the Gulf War was pretty much one sided when it came down, I still found it informative on the mindset U.S. tank crews had on the Iraqi armored forces, and was surprised on how little training the Iraqis received, that its no wonder the Coalition won."
"Daughter is 2 1/2 yrs old and it came natural on driving it. She has hrs of play time with it.  Its great.  I have no complaints on this."

"I have now been using the Haan SI-70 for about 6 months.  I love it. It meets my expectations.  I bought it after reviewing and reading reviews on a number of machines. Consumer Reports had listed an earlier version as their top pick but mentioned several negative issues such as a weak handle.  As soon as I put this machine together, it was as though they had read the same article and gone back to the drawing board and made the necessary corrections.  The only issue that will never be solved is having a long enough cord.  Really not an issue of importance to me and easily resolved with a longer extension cord or a smaller house.1. I would recommend using mineral free water just as you should in your cloths iron.2. Try following the directions.  The directions are important.  Don't, for example, place the pad on the machine as it warms up. They give you a rubber pad to place the machine on as it warms up. You are not trying to work with a wet pad but a pad though which the steam can flow. It is all in the directions and my wife has proven that that does not necessarily mean people follow them.3.  There is a learning curve with this and any other steamer.  It feels as though you are moving a lot more slowly which is true. I followed the directions and take about a four foot square and slowly move the steamer over a path once, move over and go over a second area and then pass over the 1st area a second time.  That removes the tough dirt. The key is not to rush and change the pads when they get wet. Again, it is all in their directions. Ultimately, I find this considerably faster and more satisfying than mopping in the traditional manner.4.  I believe that rugs should be vacuumed first and then again after use of the steamer, again in the directions.  Remember, it kills the mites and bacteria that live in your rugs.5.  I also found that being able to remove the steamer and use it on my bedding  worked great. It is not a fast process but once a month is not that bad. Again, dust mites and bacteria can be destroyed.6.  For the price, the Haan is a great purchase."
"SOUNDS AMAZING! AND SO EASY TO PUT INTO ANY OTHER DEVICE! WAY MORE CONVENIENT AND CHEAPER THAN ANY OTHER WAY :)"
"It's not fitting as I expected.Skirt is too flare.The top is too big.It's for different type of body."
"It is exactly what it says it is. These silver pieces are very very small, about the size of a dime. They weigh 3.1 grams... which is totally not worth the price one must pay to get one. They are cute however and great gift for young collectors."
"Great mouse for web browsing, not too fond of side scrolling mouse features. Great for most internet and pc gaming, any other general laptop tasks. I have small hands, this works great for me. Only major flaw, after a couple months of use... the scroll wheel becomes loose. Doesnt really affect anything unless you like to rest your finger there (gaming) then it tends to wobble up and down. Great scroll capabilities, dont really need a mousepad for it. Minimal crevices for gunk to get into. Reciever neatly tucks into battery compartment."
"Beautiful mint state 1964 Washington quarter with great detail, can even read print in the reflection of the coin. Minor defects, nicks, or dents but still a fantastic coin."
"this case is sooo cute! i love it so much. if you like protecting cases though, this isnt for you. i gave it a four star because when i got it the lace was already kind of peeling off. it will be fine though because i will just switch it out alot so i have it longer :)"
"The oil helps keep everything working smoothly. Haven't had any issues with anything sticking. Would recommend this to other people"
"Perfect match for my Dell computer--great price, too!  I am very happy with this purchase. I would order this again."
"It works well to get rid of dry skin.  I would buy it again.  It is worth the money. Thanks."
"The storyline is incredibly unusual, the acting superb with great good-guys, great bad guys, and wonderfully twisted plots that really question, do you really know people you know?"
"My 4 year old daughter saw this castle in the store and wanted it so badly. She absolutely loves Sofia. But upon reading these reviews I am extremely disappointed and will not be purchasing this for her. Something made by a brand as big as Mattel and for the amount of money this item costs you'd think that it would be better build. Made with stronger materials. A huge waste of money to anyone who buys this and disappointment to the children that want it or already have it."
"Grim story like the book.  I enjoyed the film very much.  Peter Jackson and the rest of the production crew did a fine job again.  Can't wait to see the death of smug."
"I'm not totally sure what I was expecting but very quickly found the story to be uninventive and extremely predictable which made it very boring."
"This text book arrived in a timely manner and I love that it was affordable. It's a lab manual and it had some writing in it (the first two labs were partially filled out). Other than that, it appears the rest of the manual will work out well for me."
"So much better than my old phone. So far I am loving this phone. I just wish there were better accessories available for it."
"This item is a gift for my mum who collects salt &amp; pepper shakers, loved it, havent seen anything like this before. I'm sure she will love it. Postage was quicker than I expected as well which was great."
"This jacket is so comfortable that I would love to have a Snuggie made from it.  It is very warm, but also very soft.  The length is perfect ... fingertip length for me so it keeps me warm without being too bulky.  It is cut a little small across the chest, but the arms are long enough which is a perennial issue for me as I am tall."
"it seems to be a bit tall but it won't be a problem. Check the size in a shop if you can..."
"Don't get me wrong, I really love Black Veil Brides. The music was fantastic on this album. The extra songs were worth it. But as far as the Legion of Black video goes, I was very disappointed.It's just one long music video.No dialogue at all besides the dialogue that comes in the songs already.The story was hard to follow. It's not even a story really.If you want the extra songs, just buy them online. It's not worth your money to buy the video."
"So the reason I ordered these was because it shows the stock picture of the Xbox battery packs. What I got was a cheap plastic knock of that was damaged in shipment."
"the worst costume I've seen. The mask is horrible ... only cover the face. better buy a mask in other store. The shirt is made &amp;#8203;&amp;#8203;of a very bad material and the hat is like a farmer's and is not real, is the same material as the mask .... Totally disappointing this costume."
"there is not like looks in the internet picture.  The seams are not well finish.  fabric lycra costume is not thick or strong as seen in the image of the Internet."
"I really enjoyed learning more about the brave 300. These warriors were something else, extremely tough and honorable. A very interesting read!!"
"really nice quality shirt and I love the decal. I also bought one for my brother-in-law who servers over seas"
"Having bought this buggy as an entry level product with a view to getting back in to buggy racing then it was just what I was after. You can run it virtually stock in many clubs and this means it's down to your driving as to whether you win. It's great flying over jumps and better than the slash in this respect. However, you are well advised to buy the wheelie bar as under full throttle it wheelies virtually every time, which you may think is fun, and it is to start with but when you fire the power down hard coming out of a tight turn then it's just what you don't want. They are around $11-12 on amazon and are what I would class as an essential purchase. Buying a set of bearings will help increase the speed and more importantly the run time, and I'd recommend fitting a set as your second upgrade. Both of these are normally accepted mods but if you are planning on going racing check your clubs class rules.Battery life? 8-12 mins with the standard battery and then 8 hours for a recharge is not much fun, so budget for a larger capacity Nimh battery and a fast charger, the first will increase your run time, the second will charge it back up in around 45 mins, much more fun for you and /or your kids.You can even fit a Lipo 2S but will need a matching charger, combined this could cost you $150+. I would therefore suggest a 5000Mah Nimh on amazon at under $50 and a fast charger at $30-40 will be a much better bet for most people. You can purchase an 8 cell hump pack which will also increase the Rustlers top speed to over 40mph with the extra gear fitted. Note though that to fit an 8 cell pack you will need to fit the 'Battery expander pack' - a bargain at under $6.I would therefore say the rustler gives great fun in the back yard or on the racetrack at a very low price, but budget for an extra battery, fast charger and wheelie bar as they are all essential. The bearings are a good 'nice to have' option."
"I find this book very interesting right from the start. Fell in love with the story...I can relate to the story.. I love this book."
"The Hobbit (or There and back again) is a fantasy novel written by author J.R.R. Tolkien. The novel focuses on the life of a hobbit, a small humanoid creature with hairy feet, named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a young Hobbit, who lives a quiet life, up until an old wizard named Gandalf the Grey makes an unexpected visit, which brings a multitude of guests (specifically Dwarves). The Dwarves employ a reluctant Bilbo Baggins as a burglar on their trip, as Hobbits are told to be extremely light on their feet. The rest of the book follows Bilbo on his journey with the Dwarves, and Gandalf on a quest to reclaim the mountain (the Dwarves&amp;#8217; home) from a fire dragon, called Smaug, and explains how Bilbo came into the company of a powerful ring.There were several things that I enjoyed in this this novel. The first thing that I took liking to was the style in which this novel was written. There was a very enjoyable sense of calmness, pacing when this book was written, and it shows in the novel. There is a wealth of content, which is quality, and forces the reader to continue reading page after page. Another few things about the book that I enjoyed were the introduction, and development of the characters. In the beginning of the book Bilbo seemed to be a self-concerned, cowardly, stubborn, and timid Hobbit. Slowly, but steadily, Bilbo became a strong, independent, confident, and open-minded Hobbit due to the company, of the Dwarves and Gandalf. The Dwarves, were introduced in the beginning of the book as ignorant, uncouth, haughty, complacent, and self-forcing, and even a little mean spirited. Towards the end of the book, they became friendly, likeable, and cordial characters, while maintaining the rough essence of a warrior. Bilbo&amp;#8217;s development as a character was enjoyable to observe, and correlated strongly with the Dwarves, something to the effect of dominoes. One change, or action by a character changed, or effected a character in another way. There was really only one thing that I didn&amp;#8217;t enjoy in the novel, or thought could have been better. This thing was the way that some things were explained. Trying to explain some of the subject matter of this novel, while in Old English is no easy task, but the simple solution would&amp;#8217;ve been to write using less sophisticated language, so that the reader would have an easier time comprehending what was at hand. Other than that, this was the only thing that I didn&amp;#8217;t enjoy in the novel.Aside from the perplexing language choice used in this novel, I loved everything about this novel. J.R.R. Tolkien was clearly, thinking critically while developing, and writing this novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, and questing. J.R.R. Tolkien has another book (The Desolation of Smaug) that is a sequel to The Hobbit, which I most certainly plan on obtaining, and reading, because I loved The Hobbit, and would read it over again several times, if I had the time."

"I'm not sure why anyone would be complaining about the fitment.. I have a 5 year old pair of Oakley's and these things fit better than ones from Oakley..

"I first saw these shoes in royal blue at Nordstroms, fell in love but was nervous to spend that much on shoes. Wanted to avoid an impulse buy I may regret later. I have thought about these shoes for over a year, saw them on amazon and my husband encouraged me to buy them. I am a 7 1/2 and got an 8 just in case these ran small like many designer shoes do.They arrived in the designer box with all of the material to ensure they shipped in perfect condition. Picture does not do justice, they are spectacular. They are a bit difficult to put on because of the tiny buckle and the holes in the strap were not quite wide enough for the pointy thing in the buckle, I forced it in and it was fine. The size 8 I ordered fit my 7 1/2 feet perfectly. The shoes look like jewelry and so versatile they work for business and evening.I did an all day event in Manhattan in these shoes and was surprised my feet were not overly sore like they usually are after 12 hours or so. There is a bit of a cushion for the ball of your foot, if I had foot petals in these I bet I would not have been sore at all. Going to dinner or an event on your feet for a few hours is extremely doable in these and they look fabulous, lots of compliments from men and women. I highly recommend them, just buy one half size bigger than you are."
"Fernando Rodriguez @fernrod had the privilege of listening to Peter Kageyama in an interactive workshop sponsored by Leon County, the City of Tallahassee, Village Square and Knight Creative Communities Institute (KCCI). Fernando Rodriguez @fernrod would like to share his insights of the event:Love is a worn-out word. I couldn't count how many times I've heard somebody say, ""I love my triple grande caramel macchiato"" or my wife ask me ""Don't you love how these jeans fit me?"" For those reasons, I was skeptical when I opened the email that read Register to Attend the For the Love of Cities: Tallahassee + Leon County Workshop. I was invited to attend this interactive workshop sponsored by Leon County, the City of Tallahassee, Village Square and Knight Creative Communities Institute (KCCI). The guest speaker was author Peter Kageyama, who has spoken all over the world about bottom up community development and the amazing people that are making change happen.The day of the workshop finally came. As I entered the FSU Alumni Association, I could see a heterogeneous group of men, women, senior citizens and college students, Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics and even members of the LBGT community. At my table were other unofficial ""city-makers,"" creative people with a passion for their hometown that want to make it a better place to live and identify ideas that help make things happen.Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, Peter addressed a captive audience saying, ""A mutual love affair between people and their place is one of the most powerful influences in our lives, yet rarely thought of in terms of a relationship"" as images of museums, playgrounds, bike paths, pedestrian walks and monumental works of art, were projected on the screen.I was familiar with most of these places. I had recently taken my family to New Orleans and visited the National World War II Museum. I have strolled down the pedestrian walk at Times Square and admired Cloud Gate, one of the monumental works of art at Chicago's Millennium Park. Nothing was new, except the term he coined to describe them: love letters from the city.Peter focused our attention to the center of the table. There were easel papers, Post-it-notes, pencils and colored markers. He asked each participant to write what we loved about Tallahassee on a Post-it note, come up to the microphone and share it with everyone. This is when his true gift was revealed: the ability to move people to action.After a few minutes, most of the room eagerly started to make their way to the microphone. One after another, each person filled the room with a sense of pride that I had not felt before. They were saying, ""I love Tallahassee's bike trails,"" ""I love our canopy roads,"" ""I love Tallahassee Community College"" and the anticipated ""I love the Seminoles!!!""Peter gave us two more assignments: to come up with a design for a Tallahassee t-shirt and to create a new (or revive an old) city ritual or tradition. Again, a long line of volunteers stepped up to the mic and share their ""50 Shades of Trees"" and ""Talla-Happy"" t-shirt designs, among others.The ritual or tradition ideas generated by attendees were as creative. ""Let's bring back the hot air balloon festival"" and ""We suggest closing Tennessee St. and break Bosnia's world record of 1,521 couples dancing in the streets. This would certainly give another meaning to the expression: Tennessee Waltz."" The audience was energized!That day I learned two valuable lessons. When we consider the emotional connection we have with our cities, we open up new possibilities in community, social and economic development, and love is not a worn-out word after all."

"I work for the Department of Corrections and anything brought into the system has to be in a clear see through bag.  The straps on this bag are long enough to throw over my shoulder.  Large enough for all my nursing equipment."

"I ordered the Sun Power like in the description and I received &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;. It was way too light of a shade for my skin tone and that's not what I wanted. I called Eileen at the house of beauty and she said she did not have that shade. She refunded my money but if your interested in the sun power she does not have it. Truly disappointed because I really wanted the Sun power not the natural."
"I love this lotion! It is by far my fav!!! You must purchase this lotion! &amp; its a great deal. At Malibu its 160$"
"I thought these pair of earrings would be adorable to put up in your cartilage. I thought they were going to be a little bigger than what they are. They are pretty little, but I still think they are cute."
"I had watched this show back in the early 70's. I am glad I was able to get the Mega set.  It brought back some good memories and Gabrielle Drake was just plain hot as Lt Ellis."
"directions were written in japanese or chinese, whatever, I could not read them. too bad the packaging was ripped so no return."
"I've had this screen protector on for at least a week or two now, and I really have no complaints. My brother put it on for me, but he didn't have trouble with bubbles and the screen protector hasn't peeled or anything yet. It's working really well, and I'm very satisfied. Love that there are 3 screen protectors, they'll last a while."
"Love the book, I am a giant Bond fan so I was super excited to get this book to see where and how it all started. Definitely a good read for any Bond fan."
"Who could possibly NOT love this movie. Great classic even better on blu ray. Highly recommend for any fan of Van Damme, Lundgren, or action movies in general."
"Great movie, with great music and fairly good acting all things considered. And even better on blu ray. I wish they would make a movie of Return to Labyrinth. I could die happy then."
"Great cult movie. Great Corman movie. Fairly great blu ray. Considering when it was made and the budget, it looks really good on blu ray. Now I can watch through all four Death Race films in one sitting."
"I love this single. Love Is Only A Feeling is one of my favorite Darkness songs. But it took soooo long to get here haha."
"Great show, great season. It's interesting how much Spock changed from the beginning of this season to the later Spock we all know and love. He started out kind of smug and showing a little emotion. Just shows you how much of a progressive show this was."
"Fairly good series if you can handle quite a bit of teen drama. I bought this for my brother for his birthday (He's 21... yeah...) But I'm very pleased with the set. Regardless of how I may feel about the series on a good or bad day, the set is well put together and well endowed with extras which is always nice."
"Great game. I loved the original and this one does a great job of mixing the original with new style graphics, gameplay and plot devices. Very nice. And multiplayer is still the best feature of the game."
"As far as today's thriller/horror genre goes, I am fed up with watered down PG-13 movies that try to distract us from lack of gore with an overproduced plot and mediocre special effects. And I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Daniel Craig and his beautiful wife Rachel Weisz, and because I was interested to see the movie they met while making. And even though I think the above of the newer thriller/horror genre, I can tell you that is not the case with this movie. Very good movie and well acted and fun to watch. Recommend."
"Great set. I got it for my mother for a Christmas present and she looooves it. I was very pleased."
"To anyone who has ever played The Settlers of Catan, you probably already have a decent understanding of how intense a game can be (especially when resources are tight). The extension (in my opinion) is even more fun to play than the standard 3-4 player game. I highly recommend this game set to anyone who is looking for an addicting board game."
"This song gets me motivated to do anything, and tell people to get the **** out of my way!Thank you!"
"If you want the bass that rattles your head and face plus good mids and treble, dont waste your time more. I have 30 audiophile and basshead headphones. I can say, this is the best basshead headphones with no doubt followed by monster inspiration and sony Pulse Elite. People that comlain about the highs and mids havnt heard other headphones. You can not get better with so significant bass. Also remeber that this in a closed back headhphone. IMO this is the best you can get with maximum base and ok mids and treble. There no better option. There are better headphones for mids and highs but bass falls short on them like AKGs 702 or AD M50. Only thins is beware of sound leakage."
"We are an older group and remember the dance moves. The body takes a bit longer to remember them.Great workout and fun."

"Our young daughter was delighted with this toy as soon as she started playing with it. This has to be the best value toy I have picked up so far for her."
"Daniel Mason is a character that leaves you conflicted between feelings of sympathy, shock and pity. Campbell weaves a gripping tale that draws you in for more as you feel you are right there with the protagonist soaking in the sights and sounds, experiencing the frantic energy of the streets, enjoying time spent with lovers and living as a foreigner both fascinated and alienated by new surroundings.An original story with many layers, Typhoon Season leaves you breathless and revaulating everyday sensory experiences."
"Just what we needed when we needed it!  Well researched.  Realistic.  Honest.  Hopeful.  Something both parties in a Long Distance Relationship should read."

"Last summer i cut my hair really short this product made my hair grow inches longer now my hair is down to my neck i can wear it in a full ponytail the bottle is almost gone i will purchase this again"
"Without a doubt, if you are thinking about purchasing these lights just do it, you won't be disappointed. Keep in mind the lights are packaged with a flush mount box that is needed.  These lights are not designed to mount to a standard in wall outlet box.I bought two of them for our front deck/carport area as they offered the utilitarian design and flush mount installation that I was looking for."
"I like it very much and for the price yes please. I can change it every time I need a new one."
"Nice shoes they fit nice, at the beginning a lil tight but then they start adjusting to your feet form. I like them a lot l have it a four star bc the heel is ok not great I would've be perfect if the heel had a stronger support."
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Mom.  She never knew she looked so good wearing the color red."
"I love it and i lost 10lbs the first two in half weeks doing almost everyday and if you love to dance then this is great for you.....  I love to get down to these dance moves too, easy to learn if you no how to dance and if you no what you are doing too...."
"I fell in love with this series right from the beginning - the Men are hot and sexy and the ladies are loveable - BUT this book - WOW!!! all I can say is WOW!! Jarod is beyond hot and Sexy and Ce Ce - well you just can't help but love and admire her!  Wendy hit it out of the ball park with this book.  From the moment I read the first line to the very end of the book I was captivated and intrigued.  I was torn because I couldn't wait to find out what direction the book was taking but sad that it had to end.  You fall so easily into the book - totally worth the read !!!"
"Firstly, the power supply transformer was a dud.  Checked with multimeter, no output.  Obtained a replacement power supply, and the router responded as expected when power was supplied, but my computer (Toshiba Satellite running Windows 7 Professional) did not recognize it.  Followed Cradlepoint instructions to configure, router ceased responding and locked up on first window.  No response at all after that.Fortunately, Amazon's return service worked exactly as advertised.  Unit was returned without a hitch."

"This was the fourth battery I had to try and after two months it is working great. Lasts a long time. At first the computer wouldn't tell me how much battery power I had left and would suddenly shut down, but then it recently started telling me I have 10% so I don't have to worry about an improper shutdown. Happy this product is working well. Company also was very helpful by sending emails to let me know that if I had any problems they were there to help. Response was very quick."

"Amazing book. There's nothing false about it. I wish I could meet these dudes.Everything these guys did is remarkable and none of them should have been convicted of anything."
"Since I live in FL, when this hoof polish was delivered, it was extremely hot.  When I went to open it for the very first time, it sprayed out everywhere like a shaken can of soda pop.  It is very hard to remove from my skin, even with the fingernail polish remover I used. It stained my clothes permanently."
"We all think we do not have the time...for worship, for prayer, or just to study God's word. I know that I do a lot in my day, but once I evaluated what I did and how long it took, I realized I DID have time"
"A different take on crosswords and jumbles, it is something that I am enjoying while waiting for the bus or plane"
"Every time you need to get some item to hire a person it takes a lot of energy. You may get one quick,but it is so seldom. Sometimes it may take you several full sets of energy and you still don't get the item. I got sick of it. Not fun anymore"
"Rick Polad did another awesome job on his second book in the series. Rick's descriptive writing style makes you feel like you are there with Spencer as it happens. I enjoyed both books so far, But I have to say that this one was my favorite. On to book three! :)"
"I wanted to get a color that wasn't pink, since that is what the majority of my Gelish collection is. I though a bright purple would be cool. Color doesn't look purple at all."
"It's a cute color, I like it.. Like the other reviewers said, the color looks kind of like a mermaid tail."
"We bought this painting to hang in our bedroom. Overall we are happy with the quality of it. The colors of the water are slightly different as there is no purply/greyish/blue on the sides of the water, but none the less, it's still very pretty."
"200 glass screens for 20 bucks. You really can't go wrong with that price. Good quality and fast shipping!"
"I received this item by the date they had provided me. This is the cases I needed but it's a tad to small and I can't use all the pieces, I only have the rubber cover on it and it's still small it covers enough of the phone but still hands off the sides, I give two stars for fast shopping and the item is what it says but I think it was made for a different phone."
"I have always had problems with my weight and eating healthy. Lately I have been looking for a more efficient way to get the vitamins I need without all the hassle. That when I came across juicing. I had wanted to do this for a while but I never really knew how. That&amp;#8217;s why I love this book. I taught me everything I needed to know about juicing. It makes it so much easier than it would have been. This book not only teaches you how to juice, it also teaches you what to juice. I taught me what ingredients to use to get the most nutritional value. Because of this book I&amp;#8217;m now a juicer and I&amp;#8217;ll never go back."
"The 5:2 Diet cookbook is a very wise choice for someone who is always busy. I hate diets because they never work, that&amp;#8217;s why I loved how this cookbook explained to me what a diet is supposed to be. After reading that I was eager and ready to learn. This cookbook provides very delicious recipes that can be made effortlessly. That&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s ideal for someone who is always busy. Anyone can prefect these meals. This diet plan takes dedication and commitment. You defiantly have to stick with it to see results."
"This cook book drew me in because it gives extensive details about diets. Most cook books only give you recipes but this cook book explains to you what a diet really is. It also teaches you about diseases that being overweight can cause. It taught me what foods were good and bad for me. It also taught me how to save money with this new diet. This was really helpful to me. The recipes in this book were very easy to make."
"I love this case so much. It fits my phone perfectly, and it is so beautiful"
"Cute"
"Was very happy with the product, I was so happy that it could be shipped out right away. My son loved his costume for Halloween, would definitely recommend this to any parent"
"I like the way it looks, its multifunctional. I haven't used it yet though. I like the wallet phone case combo"
"i think it is a good product for someone who want to play some new techniques.The provided SDK can do lots of things that is suitable for not only research or developing."
"Being able to charge my Kindle without a USB port is just what I needed. I am happy that Amazon made it so easy to get this item."
"""After the Cure"" seemed like a totally different story from ""The Cure"" - different characters, different place with a thread of the first story in it.  I never even found out who was in the hooded robe in the closing scene of the last book. Isn't that what sequels are for? To continue the original story and explain? The grammar and punctuation weren't very good either. I really think they need a new editor, or at least a proofreader!"
"Not much people can really pin point what really happen during reincarnation (by memory at least), however this book showed a unique approach. Whether it's true or not, the plots of the characters here give me some fresh points of view. It triggers some questions within me, what if that's what happens in this real world ? Each different plots were presented in such a natural way, gloomy or happy ending. The gloomy ones left me feeling relieved, that such tragedy in the character was finally ended. The good ones left me with the soothing feeling, that kept me going through all the circle of the chapters."
"A compra se realizou de modo a me dar satisfao completa.  O rel&amp;oacute;gio parece ser artigo bem mais caro pois causa boa presena.  Estou muito satisfeito e vou recomend-lo aos meus amigos."
"More like an Ingmar Bergman film than a BBC detective story.  Multi layered character studies. Wrenching and tortured relationships and some of the the most graphic and beautiful  cinematography I've ever seen in a crime series.Plot twists. Tortured relationships and a driven detective make this, in my opinion, one of the best TV productions I have ever had the pleasure to warch."
"Translation is slightly annoying but funny. I would recommend it I  you want  an rpg. There I  a game quite similar to this  called zenonia 3 and 4 are free with it."
"Reminds me of ff8 card battles. I love final fantasy 8 my favorite part is the card game so i definitely love this game."
"Very nice"
"It's a good portable device and you can easily carry it with the case given. It have a decent design and battery life. But have less supported apps."
"This purse was a birthday gift from my husband he may my day I totally love it the color the quality of it and the space I highly recommend it if you like big purses!"
"I put it on left it on till it was all dry.Then got into the shower and washed it off with warm water after I towel dried my skin was so smooth.You can tell it washed away old dead skin cells.It's great!  Thank You Debbie"
"We bought this for our school camera. Always love transcend products! This one is no exception...will definitely purchase similar products again inthe future!"
"I thought they would be a bit bigger, and they are kinda hard to use. But great assortment. but only one size so I would recamend like small nails."
"They are good but fall off after like 4 hours, so don't were them to somewere you are at all day."
"The wig was pretty good it fit descent and looks pretty close to the real hair I would recommend it ."
"This is the fourth KINDLE device I have purchased. Started with the original and have just kept updating. I have passed the older devices to family and yes they all still work. On the rare occasion that I've needed customer or technical support it's been handled very well by Amazon.Guess I qualify as a dedicated and loyal KINDLE user. Several friends have purchased KINDLES after using mine and finding out what they can do and how easy they are to use."
"I have been on zeal for 4 months.  Love what the product has done for me.  My blood pressure has gone down along with some of my weight.  I have stayed full all morning and not snack as much.  I love ordering from amazon because it come to my door."
"its not as bright as the one that comes with the nzxt phantom but its not dim either so yeah. im not much of a geek when it comes to the guts of a pc but i was able to finger it out in about 45 minutes. im disappointed that i couldnt connect it to the other 200mm fan at the top to turn on the leds with the same button in the rear of the case but it comes with its own switch and i fairly certain i can set it up the way i want if i tear apart the pc further than i did just to install it. but its no biggy im sure you techies can do some crazy s*** setup with the fan."
"fits my tf700t well has many uses and positions which is cool for the price and all port are open so you can charge it, use the camera, insert sd cards, press volume and power buttons even with the case on so yeah.....questions...."
"its been about 2 weeks now and my tf700t is doing good with the new armorsuit.  The application process is a bit scary cuz u gotta put all this liquid on your tablet before applying the screen protector.  oh and you gotta wait 24 hrs to use the tablet after application wtf is that i gotta wait 24 hrs to see if all this liquid didnt kill my tablet??? nah son!!!  its cool i guess cuz you can take it off and re apply it and it does look good after a few days of setting in. but liquid and tech dont mix and for that it looses a star. if you want to buy this youll be happy with it after the scary process of applying it."
"Bought these for my daughter. She took them off just long enough to tell me they were the best sound she has had from her mp3 player."
"The adult recipient was very appreciative of the gift and the opportunity to expand his reading library.  It was nice to have a gift card to print out and present.  Thanks for the availability!"

"I had severe lower back pain starting at 10 weeks of pregnancy. I see both a chiropractor and a physical therapist because of the extreme pain. They both suggested this pillow. At first a was not interested, but I am so glad I invested in it!!! I can now sleep at night without the fear of feeling like my back is going to break. I am now 6 months pregnant. This pillow did not magically cure me, but it does make me more comfortable! I love it!"
"I enjoyed this boxed set very much. The only thing I dislike about any book is narration. I like to hear and feel what the characters have to say or are feeling,I other than that I really enjoyed the change if pace from other romanc books...this series had scandal death and so on in it. Another favorite author!!"
"These are toHe best rollers for quic curls, traveling and no fuss. I couldn't believe the flexibility. Toooo cool"

"just ordered the 22"" premium 2 hose hookah (ocean blue), everything was great, shipping came right on time, everything looks great, then on the 2nd day, we decided to clean the hookah, and all of a sudden it shattered on us. I am unable to locate a number to contact for the supplier and am not sure what to do, not happy with the fact that the product shattered on us, i hope a refund or they can replace this for us."

"The folks sent me 2 cartridgesThe 2 nd one heated up so I must have another issue. They were helpful as they sent me the 2nd one free of charge!"
"This author was very intent, clear and gave some insight for the answers, but to also reflect on at the same time.  I felt he really had the reader in his heart and mind doing his very best to clarify as much as he possibly could in this context.  I would read more by this author because of the dedication that seemed to come across to share his faith and knowledge and to help me as a reader to gain some of those same things."

"I really enjoyed reading this book but the Ira chapters in the middle of the story were difficult to read through.  The love Luke has for Sophia is darling and overall, I hope this story is a movie some day :)"
"Download wouldn't work; on the otherhand, the agent who arranged forcompensation did a fantastic job. To be ... &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; ... I've been a Steam/Valvecustomer for years and the download did work. The game just wouldn't play.I could not find direct contact with them except thru forums (useless attempt)to get a refund or credit.I finally purchased the disk from a local store and even then the game wouldnot play until I changed some of the codes imbedded in the game. Now, this ison PC; I spent over $100 for a game that is less fun than Skyrim and that forcedme to modify it in order to play it."
"The tank fits as expected . I dont have a flat tummy and im short so I bought a large . It doesn't fit too snug . The XL  would have been a much lower cut ."

"The toy is great, but there is no place to store the cards. If they would make the plastic part just a little bigger, then you could store the cards and the buttons inside so nothing gets lost and the cards don't get bent."
"Bought for my 18 mo old. He is a little young for it, but my friend's almost 3yo went right for it and played with it for a long time...and that was the last time the drill worked properly. It only lasted for ONE playtime! I have an older Fischer Price drill that I got second hand and it is still working. The insides of the ALEX drill must be the cheapest plastic they could find. This could be a really great toy if they would provide a drill that would stand up to the age group that it was built for. Hey ALEX.... can you send me a new- better drill??"

"This little outfit is so cute.  I bought it for my 2yrs. old g'granddaughter and it fits perfectly.  She is adorable in it."
"This movement holder is exactly as described and does a good job. The only complaint I have is on smaller movements, the pins tend to limit your access to the movement. They get in the way a bit, but it's mainly a minor irritation, not a debilitating problem."

"A few good calm songs, a few good hard rock songs that truly kick ass. Think that the world &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; in &amp;#34;Pop Evil must really be in capital letter. The rest of the album is not bad but nothing more."
"A large type of music in this album. Singer's voice song's like C. Bennington from linkin park. Sometimes accoustic, folk, alternative, hard rock or Nu Metal, but always on it.AS what I think they deserved to be more popular."

Also they come with an echo reduction cord that you have to have in your controller all the time and is super annoying. Last thing is that the cords are a mile long and always in the way. Do yourself a favor pay more to get a better wireless set."

"I have problems with my hands and these work great and feel good cutting.  I would recommend this to any one with hand problems."
"It's not what I thought it was,  It's way to small and got broke trying to put the plastic holders back on the base."

"This is great to start with the thread is in good quantity,  But the scissors are hard to work with."

"Fast, able to handle gaming and engineering solid models. I purchased this on my newest PC build with intent for high end gaming with occasional SolidWorks use in Nov 2012.Pros:1. Easy install2. Looks awesome (my PC has a clear section on the case. These help the ""why is that not in outer space"" impressive appearance)3. Very fast4. Never been able to max it out yet (even with highly graphics modded Skyrim.)5. Still expandable to 32 if your running extensive video and higher level Windows 7 or 8Cons:1. Still a bit price heavy, but I got them Black Friday so no issue for me."
"I rated this 5 stars due to the fact that I had had a larger size Kong before and it was able to stand up to my Huskys' play.  This was a dog that could destroy anything within 5 minutes.  Except his Kong toy.  I got the puppy Kong for my american eskimo/husky puppy and she loves it!  Keeps her occupied for hours.  The only problem I have now is keeping the cat from stealing it and hiding it.  She loves it too!  My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that they don't give you a choice of colors.  My dog is a female, and although I'm not sure how well dogs can tell colors, I would prefer that I was given a pink one instead of blue.  Minor complaint, I know.  Otherwise this far exceeds any other toy she has."
"Great show. One of the best on TV. My wife and I have seen the entire series and love every season."

"This bag is perfect for my many travels this summer with my little toddler! I search online tillI found this bag; the size is great and its very stylish. However, there it is labeled as &amp;#34;CA prop 65.&amp;#34;I've never purchased anything with this label. The state of California has proved that this productcontains chemicals that cause cancer and fertility issues along with birth defects. Being that I am 7 weekspregnant and plan to use this purse daily, I've decided to return it. Other than that It was perfect for me.Makes me wonder what else should or has this label on it?"

"This has been a really good case for me. The stand works great for me. I havent had any problems with the magnet being to strong, everything has worked great for me. I know there are cheaper cases out there but I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. If your willing to invest hundreds in a tablet then you might as well pay a little more for a case that will actually last and protect it. I love it. It has done everything you would need in a case."

"I bought the tortoise gt sunglasses and after having them for a few weeks, I am very disappointed. At opening, I was very excited because they looked great and the metal piece holding the lenses seemed reliable. I noticed some lines across some parts of the plastic frame, but I didn't think much about them. In less than two weeks, one of the legs of the frame broke off! I didn't even apply much pressure. I placed it on top of my head, and while I lifted it off, it just fell apart. I wanted these to be sunglasses I didn't have to be worried about breaking but something that could hold up during the summer. These weren't it."
"I enjoyed the variety of characters, and the natural progression of the story.Kept me entertained from start to finish."
"It's simple and made cheap, the tablet slips out of the adjustable grips sometimes so I don't trust it all the time. It is what it is and it's better than nothing at all."

"This is a great cd for singing along, dancing all over the house, or cleaning to the music!  What uplifting songs and melodies and rhythms.  Also, for those of us older folk who liked music from the rock and roll era and groups like mamas and papas and peter, paul, and mary."

It would stop leaking at the nozzle occasionally but continually leaked at the house connection.  It finally started leaking so bad at the nozzle that I lost pressure.  I finally threw it out and bought a different hose."
"Bought this for my girlfriend because it was on sale at the time, and she adores it. She loves the Garnet in the shape of a heart, and says the size surprised her,but loves how small it is,giving it a subtle feel to it,even with how complex the design is around the heart. She's worn it every day ever since. Came in undamaged and even sooner than the expected date. Overall a great purchase."

"It's not the pretty blue in the picture and it's a tight fit. I guess I got what I paid for."

"These tapers were perfect size and not cheap looking at all. Very fashionable and I would definetly buy from this seller again. Too bad I got too small of a mm. I got 12 mm when I should have gotten 14 mm."

"Satisfied in its aspects , but its memory is not that much good...browsing with pointer is diffcalt and slow,that is not ok"
"its very thin and light weight. but the colors are vibrant. perfect for indoor hanging. if you buy it hoping to put it on your truck or fly it on a staff outside then you'll most likely rate it much different. it is clearly not meant for that. but a great product for the price."
"i just got this light today in the mail. its very bright which i thought it wasnt going to be so thats a plus. it seems heavy duty, i bought am extention cord ahead of time and im glad i did cause the cord it coiled very tight and probably wont reach very far. other than that only time will tell. ill give an update soon once i have been on a few jobs with it and once it rains heavy on it and everything. the only reason i put 4 stars is because when its plugged in and you turn your car on it automatically turns on to the first of 7 unique patterns so you have to push the button 7 times to turn it off. other than that its a great buy so far. i know it will light up the area at night because of how bright it is in the day time. bye for now."
"I would have given this 0 stars but it wouldn't let me.  This was not as advertised and it was certainly not new."
"The reflective tape was exactly what I was looking to make minor alterations to the shimmer of my lures, excellent"
"I've been using this product since the mid 1990's. It is without a doubt the best way to keep lips exfoliated from dry patches and chapping. Be sure to use the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; generously and let it dry completely. The more you use, and the drier it gets, the better the result. Also make sure your lips are dry and free of balm before applying the mask. When you're sure it's completely dry, rub it off with one or two VERY DRY fingertips until you have removed as much as possible. Then you can rinse the remaining product off and follow up with the balm or any other lip moisturizer. I like to follow it with a lip plumper like Lip Fusion or Buxom. The balm included with the product is fine for immediate moisturizing after the mask, but but I would give it alone only 3 stars."
"My S100 really uses more battery power than my last camera, so I got an extra battery. Wish I had got a couple. The price and quality of these batteries are really good."
