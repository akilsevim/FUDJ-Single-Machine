Sue (Zoo, as her buddy calls her) tells a sometimes upsetting, always heartening story of how she comes to know an elderly man who survived more than a life's worth of hurts, yet maintained his spirit and spark throughout. The story is written in a somewhat disjointed manner, jumping from era/scene to a completely different era/scene, but that matches the story b/c it mirrors how she came to know more about this friend. The information he shared was piecemeal, out of time, snippets that she had to piece together bit by bit. Worth the read for sure.
I like the case however, it fits loosely and the tablet is moving around alot...otherwise it's an excellent piece for the price.  I would recommend it  however, you should get the specifications correct..
Nothing special here. It feels good in my hand, does the job it is intended for,  holds an edge well, and doesn't flex when you score wood.
This adaptor is a great tool to have and is extremely affordable. My only suggestion is that it need to be water proof!!! It shorts out after washing my ride!!
nice but a little big on me im 5'1 and weigh 110 other than that it looks nice i like it
I have read over 60 zombie novels including zombie fallout, a new world, the remaining, and surviving the dead. I would have to say i enjoyed this one every bit as much as those. In fact in some ways more because this was not another series, it actually had and ending. I spent a long time scrolling thru ebooks looking for and new zombie read and honestly didn't expect much out of this book but was happy enough with it to write the first review i have ever done. As far as the mistakes or grammar problems, i was enjoying the story to much to really notice any. GREAT story cant wait for the next one.
It really does happen that children are abused this way. It did take me a who l e to read this because the details of what he suffered were hard to swallow but. It is something that society needs to have their eyes open to.
This definitely wakes up the engine. It does make a bit more power but what it really changes is the engine sound.  It's much louder and sounds mean. The intake is a bit pricey but its much better than getting just a filter.
Really enjoyed reading this book. Started reading for the first book to this one and I can wait to see what happens in book 4.
It arrived too late, not very useful, unless you use two at a timenot some think i would recommend
does the job thoroughly. good for the price, in store this is a 30$ or more grinder. good buy, i like that the smart crusher logo is just a sticker and can removed very easily so you're left with a basic sleek grinder,
This short story was cute and funny! It doesn't have anything to do with Devereux so if you are expecting that then you will be disappointed. If you really love this series like I do then you should definately read this shorty story as well. Just don't try to read this without reading the other books that came before it or you will definatley not get it. I recommend reading them all for sure!
Collection of stories and historical perspective from the beginnings at West Point.Good conversation starter.Wish there was an iBooks version to accompany the Print version
Works good.  I was able to hear conversation and it lessened the noise from semi auto hand gun noise.  I have not used it with rifle yet.
This keyboard is a great buy.  It is lightweight and the spacing of the keys make it comfortable to type on.  I initially had a problem getting it to connect to my iPad, then I realized I was not doing it correctly.  It works great and I would recommend it to anyone.
It's been a great buy for us. The wholes are on the smaller side that's why I gave it a 4 star but overall it's a very handy tool to have in the kitchen. After cleaning the peppers with corer I fill the pan with peppers then the peppers with a piping bag. Quick and easy.
I keep these units in my bag, car etc... Great backups to have on hand  They fit perfectly into life case and are of good quality
I'm 5'10\ 174 curvy and I have a big butt and thighs. Brought a small/medium the only problem is my butt hangs out the bottom. I have spanks so it won't be a problem but if you're tall like me and have curves do the bigger size. But if you have a small waist do the small/medium. The material is nice as far as costumes go. Its soft, stretchy material. I also brought the leg avenue crop gloves, very nice and the whip thats in the pic. Love it tho!
Very interesting.. An historic and present view of world megatrends with focus on their geographical position and potential conflictsI have not finished reading..
Absolutely love this case for the durability and peace of mind. it is a little bulky though....makes it hard to get in and out of your pocket
RAPIDO EN LLEGAR Y FACIL INSTALACION, BARATO Y GENERA MAS RENDIMIENTO DEL AUTO EN CONDICIONES DE CALIENTE O CON EL MOTOR CALIENTE
I honestly love this bouncer, my feet can tell you otherwise... It definetly will not flop over because of the wide base. I've tripped many times with the base of it since it really sticks out. Other than some jammed toes, my daughter really seems to enjoy it, I would recommend buying! It's easy to assemble and the material can be quickly removed for a wash.
good.. but  my daughter hates it. T^TI didn't know what to do&#12619;&#12619; &#12622;&#12622; &#12636;&#12636;Thank you very much.
This game is played just like the real game of dominos, unlike some digital copies that change things to make it easier. I like that.
My three year old is addicted to this game. He loves it and plays every chance he gets. I don't like the blood, considering his age, but apparently it's not to hard. Though he has spent a few hours on one level.
Regular DSlite. Came with what was described. Took a while for it start a game and was dusty. God bless canned air. Stylus falls out from time to time since it's not the original.
I was involved as a provider of one of the helicopter services and pilot that participated in the rescue and nominated both pilots for the Helicopter Association International Robert E.Trimble Memorial Award.
I think this is a solid watch.  I have bought a few watches in the past few years to diversify my business wear, and this watch is by far my favorite for any black band or gold watch that I have.  The blue accents the gold real well and it wears nicely.  It is certainly a conversation piece.
I bought this so we wouldn't keep breaking our Corelle dinner plates. We usually make our bacon in the microwave, it's a lot faster and easier. I use paper towels with this, two on the bottom and one on top, just like I always do. I like it but I don't think it does anything special. It is very easy to clean, with the paper towels it hardly even gets greasy. I will use it for a few months and update again.
My two labs live these balls and they are more durable than using actual tennis balls. I know the price is higher than people would like but to be able to use one ball and have it last s a great thing.
Filled with suspense lovely love story
Product came in a box, well wrapped up. 2 of the heads for body provided were a bit rusty.otherwise the machine works fine n the suction so far is pretty decent. Wish they supplied more cotton pads. I used it twice a wk, each time my face feels smooth after. Especially helpful for the oil seeds under eyes.
I like this shirt- however I was expecting a lighter weight material (probably my own fault for not reading the description throughly though!) This is a medium weight cotton material.I really like it though- the fit is loose and the quality is excellent. Just to note the pink logo- writing is shimmery! Again not what I was expecting, but I like it! Under Armour is always a great choice
This was a pretty good side-present for Christmas. My friend had been wanting one for a while so I got him one.
If the SF series we watch these days would leave this much for the audience to wonder, not to tell them everything that will happen in the cliche storyline in the pilot already, then I would say the good science-fiction is what we watch. &#34;After&#34; does just that, leave parts of the plot to the viewer and in the same time makes the show much more suspenseful and much more interesting than it would be if the same old cliche storyline is served over and over again.Acting in the first half of the pilot is great, further in the pilot some things are slightly illogical, (they all born on the same date ended on the same parking lot?) but in general this is very good pilot which by atmosphere reminds on the first (and so far the best) season of &#34;Walking dead&#34;. I would really like for the series to continue so that we can see what's hidden and what is that screenwriters left for us to discover.Recommend to all, but mostly to CW and SyFy screenwriters, because this is how you make an SF series and not that corn stuff we watch on those networks.
I was highly impressed how this product helped to seal loose glitter to a bedroom wall that I painted on for my daughter's bedroom.  It was a little clumpier than I was hoping but still finished with a cool design
The estimated arrival date was a couple weeks out but it came early took about a week..Very easy install and looks and feels great.Good product great price worth the wait.
I really enjoyed this book. It was very full and answered a lot of my questions about yellow fangs past. May be the best book yet.Sincerely,Leapordstar of Stormclan
I am a huge warriors fan and have read almost every book. i really thought it would be longer. still, a good book, and erin hunter has failed to dissapoint me yet again. Sincerely, Leapordstar, leader of Stormclan
The case is very cute and stylish. I would prefer that the entire case were hard, but oh well. For the price- I'm happy!
I always wear medium but I bought this one in Large and it just fits. Great colour to wear in spreing or summer. Love it
I didn`t realize it has 3/4 sleeves but it fits fine, it looks heavier in the picture than what it really is. I like it
is good. cheap and cut out of the screen protectors is nice and it fit just right and i like it!!!!
I have been using the keyboard for about 3 months. It has been as sturdy as the first time. Typing on the ipad mini is now so much better! One dislike is the fact that the keyboard does not work when we have to log in to a wifi network at a hotel. When a pop up screen appears for me to key in the passcode, I cannot seem to type uding the ZAGG. I have to open a document, type in what I need to, then copy and paste it on the pop up screen. Another issue is that the play or pause buttons cannot be used on spotify.Otherwise, I think its a great typing tool to have. Thanks!
It's pretty good, I haven't read the newest book in the series though. I have been playing video games more than reading but this was a pretty good buy.
whenever I paint my nails I put this on as a top coat, and in about 10 minutes my nails are perfectly dry. I love that they become really solid, because I hate walking around trying not to touch anything in fear of messing my nails up. the one thing I will say is it does make my nail polish peel, it wont chip, but if you get nervous and play with your nails, I wouldn't recommend this for you.
Easy to learn and use. I wish I had used this years ago. Keeps track of everything I buy. Love it!
It ok the size is good and it was like we see. The material is good, i recommand this short
When I got this hot, I saw a beautiful hot. But, the hot just a little small. Anyway, the hot is good.
The poker games are fun but very addictive game  that is very tough to beat the computer on any hand you win and try to double your small prize  ..... it will beat you 19 times out of 20 and you will lose all you just worked so hard to gain.  Very low on my list to keep you wanting to return for more ....... come on guys , these are only points ..... not money.
i used it only one time and it doesn't work any more. i used it properly with care but it...
Axe works great.  The saw is sharp but the angle of the handle is similar to a cooking knife, so you get tired if you need to cut a few pieces greater 6&#34; would work a little better handle and blade were slightly angled.
I am pleased with the brew, but not enthused.  I have had better for the price, but its ok. Thats it
because it works well, but i don't like the fact that you have to hold it upside down to read it like a normal book.yes i would recommend it .
workes great very easy to set up,there is nothing to dislike about it,yes i would recommend this to a friend.
Good dvd that shows in the life of a 40 year old Elton. Not about music really just life on the Made in England tour. Decent if you're a fan.
They work on my car because my Rouge is silver so it blends. But since it only sticks on the front and can see the original color right behind it. It is overpriced but the cheapest i found.
I just received this case in the mail today. I ordered it monday and got it by Thursday and it had to ship from california to maine. The feeling of the case is very sturdy. It is a well build case and feels great in the hand. This case is great if you looking to prevent your phone from scratches and are looking for a stylish case but with minimal protect to show off the beauty of your iphone. The back of the case is see through so you can see the apple logo. It is not white on the back as the picture shows. The devise when faced downwards on a smooth surface does not touch the surface but it would be a good idea to get a screen protector as there is very little room from the case to the screen. The only reason i gave it 4/5 is because i feel the case is a little over priced and the picture does show a white backing. I purchased it for $15 dollars when i feel it should have been more like $10 but still definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a good case with minimal protection.
I loved this case, it just looks nice and clean and well put together. It's not bulky and keeps your phone nice and thin, not slippery. Cut out openings are very precise, didn't have any trouble getting my S-pen out or using the camera. I was so heartbroken when I had to give it away, though. I have a Zagg screen protector on my Note II and after having this case on my phone for about 30 minutes my Zagg started lifting and bubbling on one corner. The inside of the case is a little too sharp to have a screen protector. I still blame the Zagg though, I feel it doesn't sit well on the screen (it extends to the edges too much). I really loved this case but, because the Zagg was a $30 purchase, I had to go with another case. If you don't have a screen protector that doesn't extend too far to the edges of your screen then you should be fine. I'm just sad I couldn't use it.
I enjoyed this book ..... A little sudden ending but over all a good read. I suggest silver ties as well by this author really great read and man some HOT bdsm in it !
If u liked fifty shades and brie's submissive training center you will love getting in on the world of DOMZ.com in this series. The story line is heart felt and the scene's are hot !
this app was very challenging yet interesting wjen my friends and i partook in playing this app. i love this app
saves  your phone  screen and is a great piece for the money.  a great buy for your smart phone. get it.
Compared to the original pens I had many years ago when the pens and black paper first came out, these pens are not as bright nor as opaque.  The original ones were much more opaque and the colors were brighter with a lot more contrast..
Certainly an enlightening book. Gladwell's writing certainly suits his purpose, and after you finish the book you'll have a new perspective on &#34;great&#34; people.
I am very glad I read this book recommend it to anyone else who have not read it.Very entertaining read.
The sweater shows and displays what it actually is. I enjoy it and I believe it was worth the money.
Good reason to read a book and never put it down. I was really enthralled b  the book.David O.
This was labled for children, but I'm a senior citizen and I enjoyed it very much.  The pictures are very pretty, the sound very good, and the variety of birds excellent.  I learned a number of bird calls I did not know before.
It's pretty except where the seams come together...and they look rough...course for the price it's not worth returning but I'm not thrilled with it...
The game is awesome but it asks you for an update and then you can't play till Yuri get the update, but there is no update.
Needed for my cabinets, fits great and definitely gives me more space. Now I would like to buy a few more!!
I like to enjoy Auction and fine good pice on ebay. I have to sit down and look for somebody bids me..
Liked the product worked great, but the thing I didnt like was that 3 of the 4 pins didn't actually bring 4 pins it brought 3 but even without it the fans worked great and ships very fast. Great product for good price
I have the first book in paper back and the second one on the kindle  and I love to read them over and over again!
I don't leave a lot of reviews but this app has been out a while an d deserves a review. When you get a free app it is hit or miss.  This is a great story. Read in a clear voice. Interactive part is basic, touch the animal and it swims away, giving the child the chance to count each before it zooms off the page. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the page after the interactive animals it simply says &quot;2 Seahorses!&quot; for example but there are no seahorses.. I would have liked to have seen the animals too. Teaching your child anything involves a lot of repetition. Giving them another chance to count would've reinforced the number counted better.  But all in all, most free books are not always this well done. Thank you for giving us a great book.
Amazing story! I would recommend this book to everyone.  I couldn't put it down.  I am impatient for book 2!  The characters are given with enough detail to draw you into their lives and have you rooting for them, or hating them. Gave 4stars because of all the errors, when you have to try to decipher what is being said it slows the pace and flow of the story.
I have played a lot of these games. I enjoy spending time with my kids trying to figure out the harder ones. Getting it as the faotd makes it even better.
Definitely a fun book. Great humor and sarcasm and just a pinch of sass. This book has got some serious laughs out of me!!
Works fine but hard to install. Should have choices on the oil pressure, as 100 psi is far to high for a lot of machines. I had to order an electric temp gauge to make it easier to install.
These are extremely tasty, but do melt very very quickly. I pop 3-4 at a time, and it's only a few seconds before they are gone. I enjoy the taste at least for a moment.
good bottle have had it just a few weeks
But I was able to make it work. Sturdy plastic, decent lock. I do wish that the hinges were a bit stronger but no bad.
I luv the mommy wigs I have numerous  colors ,they run out of #1fast in the beauty shops.so I order this color online,this my second one from here ,,only reason it's not a 5 because of the way it shrinks when you wash it
Have not got a chance to ride long with these. But they were easy to install (used small amount of dish soap), and when I sat on the bike and just played with throttle, it was a lot more padding and felt comfortable. We will see how they hold up to this weekend after a few hours of riding.
I bought this bag specifically for using on a motorcycle, will see how it holds up. There is no padding on the actual strap of the sling, but I can easy add some if needed. It will hold my water bottle and some small items and snacks while out for a ride.
Good story if you like this one you need to see Double ImpactMy friends and I all want to be locked in the bathroom with JCVD NOW!!!
I wanted a &#34;nicer&#34; jacket for winter and came across this one. The price was awesome so I gave it a try. Its a little snug but def not unbearable. Im pretty sure it fits the way its suppose to. It came on time looks great and is acually pretty warm.
Great purchase for the right price!!!! I am a huge SAINTS fan and this was just perfect, especially after losing my last necklace.
It helps with drawing. It really does! My friend had this app and now she can't stop drawing. The only downer is the priced dragons are the best dragons.
I am in sales so I am always on the move. This backpack/ briefcase is terrific. I have storage for my laptop, ipad, and much more. This product is very well thought out. I would definately recommend it to anyone considering it.
Pretty good.
I recommend this product because I have a dog that has very dry skin and she sheds quite excessively. After using this product, my dog's skin and fur was very soft and her shedding was reduced. The product does not lather up well and it's quite greasy, but it helps my dog's skin and fur stay soft.
I like this emergency solar/hand crank charge latern, it's not big, but for it's size it gives out a good light source for emergency light situations, and your kids will love it for camping.  Good Buy For The Money $14.95 S/H Included !
My husband has diabetes and a size 13 foot but the diabetic socks are so loose. He looks for socks that aren't too tight around the ankle. I had bought Hanes that were thicker in the foot but they also ended up tighter on the ankle.  He seems to like these just fine. I will most likely buy them again.
Used these for deep sea fishing in cabo Mexico found the lenses to be very flimsy but the glare was greatly reduced for the price they are great not worried about dropping them or anything like that
DID NOT EVEN SEND A BUFFING PAD WITH POLISHER TOO USE?NOTHING???? SO WHEN YOU SELL THIS PRODUCT YOU SHOULD AT LEAT HAVE SOME KIND OF BUFFING ATTACHMENT SO YOU CAN AT LEAST TRY OUT THE POLISHER?
The pad is something that we need to get use to it, but design, speed, and anything else, are very good.I recommend this laptop.
Since I am going to China in two months, i needed a map that is accurate as possible and easy to read. This map has shown me how to get by in Hong Kong. I am so well please to have this map. I do recommend this to any one who is going to China. So have some fun in Hong Kong but do bring this map with you.
This book is so easy to read and down to earth. Yet supernatural. I absolutely loved this book. I am already putting what I learned into practice. I am beginning to see in the Spirit. Moving forward in the Spirit , amen.
This is a starter for me.I've lived and worked offshore since the early '90s and I'm teaching myself navigation.This will wind up in my emergency kit on my dinghy along with my flares,EPIRB,water,nutrition bars and a bottle of Scotch.Thank you.
A great read for anyone who enjoys Courtroom/Legal stories.  Loved it so much that I'm now reading 'Silent Witness' and will happily read the full series
My case came super fast. It's super cute but not protective. Some of the glitter is coming off but I can't tell by looking at it. I like it.
It is very lovely. I love the saying.  Lovely to look at . Also a birthday present. Which was liked allot.
I have really enjoyed these books and it is nice to get an inside look at the &#34;start&#34; of everything!
This is great book from Ms. Handler. I love her sense of humor and creative writing style. There are a lot of great stories and mental images. Very funny too!
These sheets are nice and not too bad for the price.They are soft but not as soft as I would like.Color is great!
these little monkeys were a hit at my daughters babyshower,  I made them into a centere piece for the tables and each guest was able to take one home.  I placed sand in the bottom of a 4&#34; glass then poured wax on top of the sand and placed the little mokey in the melted wax so he will stay still.  then a accented the glass with a yellow ribbon to go with his banana.  Everyone loved them!
Very interesting, good book! Definitely would recommend it. Even though it is an adult book I would recommend it for teens also.
I bought this charger for my gba sp and at first I was extremely disappointed, but after messing with the charger a bit I got it to work. All I had to do was use a small screwdriver to pop up the little metal pieces at the end of the cord so they would connect with the sp. So now it works like a charm.
i like the look and the magnet closure...but of course its already lost a rhinestone!  i get compliments on it!
I love this product! It is absolutely perfect for what i use it for. But there are some minor problems but are barely noticeable if you're like me.The only problems I've encountered is a buzz in the left earphone but when i'm playing COD there is a lot of action and is not noticeable until the action dies down or until i'm in the pre-game lobby.The only other problem is when i go at-least 15 feet away from the receiver it cuts in and out of connection but again barely noticeable if you're actually playing the game.But overall i give this headset a 4 because of its pros.
The pictures are cute, but the numbers on the calander  are so small,you have to get very close to it to see it.
Great shoe, just like the rest of the Zigs I've purchased. I just wish they had a little more arch support. but overall, I love them!
This product smelled nice and manly. However, the scent didn't last very long. Most car freshners don't, so it isn't much different from the others.
These are simple black acrylic tapers; they came in time but not in the correct color. They actually came in clear. I didn't mind but just beware of inconsistency!
It's ok I mean I have seen better and some of the puzzles r hard. I'm just commenting for the free hint so yeah.
This was exactly what I expected. Large size and quality plastic. I wish the lid snapped closed rather than just layed on, but otherwise I am very happy with this purchase.
Great value. Upgrade to steel drive shafts, plastic ones broke after 3 batteries. Not even running lipo. 2wd slash is fast and powerful. ESC is not waterproof and has no mounting pegs. Overall great combo.
I buy one of these items every couple of months. It gets the job done. However, I wish it was a little better. but based on the price, I cannot complain.
delivery is so fast, good!!!I went road trip with this!!!but no protect film for lenses and screen...i thought the film was in package....
Enjoyable reading.  Faith and family are uplifted in this story and life's tragedies and heartache turn to joy in the end.
Good reading, enjoyable. I enjoyed reading about the clothes and culture of the period. A romantic, sweet, and uplifting tale.
This book is interestingI really like it because it's kind of like diary of a wimpy kid. Great bookBye
I love how this show feels in the footbed and the impact cushion of the sole construction, but the shoe was way too big in my usual size and is very fashionable. Unfortunately their are none left to order in a smaller size.
This book was an easy read, has three 30-week training schedules to choose from, and has good descriptions and explanations.
I liked it because it kept me interested to keep reading it.  yes I would recommend it to someone else.
I choose 4 stars because I thought this was a good book. There was always something going on and the emotions in this book really stood out. Everything came together so it all made sense and makes it a easy choice to read the second book. So much goes on that it doesn't get boring, every chapter holds a different problem.
I have been taking this for a month now and I have noticed a significant change in my appetite patterns after starting to take 2 pills daily. Also energy levels have increased. So far so good.
I'm happy with this purchase. The coconut oil is very light, and not very dense and greasy as other brands. Also the smell is very subtle. My problem with other coconut oils were the smell was too strong.So yea this is good for both cooking or personal use on the body.
Yes came in good quality and unused. So far the battery has lasted a long time. I'd buy definitely buy more!
I really enjoy the cake pan i like that it doesnt stick to the pan. The only negative thing about the pan that i didnt like was my cakes came out really big if you want a smaller round cake i suggest using a little battee in the pan.
This book was a travel adventure without ever leaving the sofa.  So many things that make a book a good read are in this one.  Travel, adventure, history, whimsy, biographical, bit of comedy.  I have been to many of the places covered in this book and really enjoyed the revisit.  Definitely looking forward to the next adventure!!!!
I love this, one because of the price and two how well it seems to work. My only problems is that the buttons aren't like those on BMW main manufacture key fobs. They tend to stick a little bit...but all in all I am happy with it =)
Series which seems to have really good intricate details with quite a bit plot, even has few laughs as the series progress!! so far loving it!
the first book took me by surprise and it really had alot to offer in the story and also the romance part.The second book had little less of plotline and more of the romance part. Could have done better in both sections together.I am guessing there is a third addition to this series, and hoping she would pick up on the plot better.But overall good one read book.
i gave it 4 start because series is still very good but starting to get confusing. Also dont really like olivia with the dark hair looks like a wig
This case looks exactly like it does online.  It's pretty and fits perfectly.  The only downside is that the case doesn't cover the screen.
Beats Wireless have great sound quality. On top of that they are very light and thus great to use in the gym/outdoors etc.They seem a bit less durable than what I would expect for this price but other from that they're great.
I love this it works perfectly and actaully has a good sound quality to it and its super static like past one's I have bought. I gave this 4 stars though because the remote doesnt work but maybe that because I have a ipod, who knows.
Just started game so, really don't have much to say yet but, so far I like it. I think it's a really cute game to play for all ages. :-)
This was a rich story full of love, pain, loss, new beginnings and characters who made my heart swell with emotion.  Seeing the love between Ben and Tim grow was a joy and I loved the way Jason gained a family.  Jay Bell proved that family is where your heart feels at home.
This is a great coming-of-age story with Sam learning who to trust and who is genuine.  I love the way Perie Wolford writes and the sarcasm he tosses in!  Exactly as a teenager would do.  I'm impatiently awaiting his next books in the series.
Jase does his best to free Mark to love someone else, but even being half a world away, Mark never let's him go.  DADT is gone, and good riddance!
This is a cute story of two regular guys who correct some misperceptions and fall in love.  At first I thought it was going to be a twist on 'The Gift of the Magi' but it turned out even better!
This Book Unwinds Itself Like No Other Book I've Ever Read... It At First Is A Little confusing but Then It Gets A Little Better To Understand.. It Ends Up Being A Really Good Book
I liked very much the presentation of this product. The protective film is not easy to install but the instructive video on youtube is very handy. When just aplyed it gives a kind of microgranular texture to the display but this dissapears in the next days. I do have, however, one negative oppinion. Since I ordered the full body protective skin, there are several films to aply but not enough instalation solution. Just one small cilinder spray is included. My advise: when buying the full skin please include at least 2 or 3 cilinders of installation solution.
Unfortunately it does not fully protect the phone should it drop. It is flush with the phone instead of being higher all around.
Very short skirt!!  Use a Pettiskirt extension to help with the length.  It is polyester so it is not great quality but it is a very nice costume.  Make sure you get the matching wig.
The case is thin and does not add too much bulk to the phone.  It does not cover the top nor the bottom of the phone.  There is no cover for the glass either.  It does provide a very nice holster.  When the phone is not in the holster, the holster is hardly noticeable. It does offer a kickstand that is not even apparent unless you are looking for it.  I have not used this feature but the design of it is very impressive.
This is a helpful book which shows the contrast between the Isa the messiah of Islam and Jesus of Nazareth.  You may be surprised to see the similarities initially, but as the book progresses, you will see that they are two very different people who cannot be reconciled.  One is a man who never died and was not God the Son.  The other is God the Son, who died on the cross for our sins.  These are helpful concepts.
This compact hub is neat and functions well.  I have been pleased with its performance.  It is immediately sensed; no problems with its use.Robert Patton
I like it for the kitchen sink just to use for small stuff or making tea etc... Other than that its just a plain one or two filter media.but culligan so far is better than some of its competitors at use vs price. You can get water testing supplies and test your results to see over time how they perform.
Good tasting chewing gun that lasts a good while, but be warned this gum will become one of the most stickiest gum to get off your fingers once completed.
Used in a hyundai sonata 2012 and work well with the factory projector lamps to make an almost HID appearance and keep brightness to see ahead. The filiment alignment and glass tinting done by PIAA are way better than the cheaper china $25 ones by FAR!!
Very good company that makes carabiners. I use this mostly as a keychain organizer but if needed it works great at holding me with room to spare.
Made of nice thick solid metal and nice welds and overall appearance and function. Works well in what i'm using it for which is hanging a somewhat heavy metal birdfeeder.
Good little frame for the price on Amazon, and has the option on back for sitting on a desk or hanging.
Pretty good peanuts, not too salty and not too oily. Overall a somewhat hard crunchy peanut that has a unique flavor and roast to it.
These hepa filters work great for kenmore vacuum we have. They were a good price here on Amazon and we replace them regularly due to allergies.
Very good tire and rim cleaner. It cleans tires and rims with hardly any scrubbing, none if reasonably light dust. For years i used a dollar store cleaner made by quick stuff inc but that was discontinued as company went OOB. This is good if you can get Eagle One AtoZ at a good price, this is the only cleaner by eagle one I like or would use. Have used it on chrome and aluminum rims with no issues of acidity or tire markings.
A gift for my niece who loves horses. You can tell up close it is made of resin but is a well done resin as far as the relief of carving. Holds a fair amount of rings or necklaces etc.
Used it to fill a tahoe and a small car, both works well and the pump doesn't even drag at all. Nicely built pump compressor, recommend this over the cheaper plastic ones.
It's recycled so that is great, the pens last a long time and really good to write with. Not sure if ink is recycled but its an overall good pen.
Not a real fan of Rihanna, but she does have a few hits or songs i like. This song with Mikky Ekko is really nice and has a good beat or rhythm to it. She sings very well on this.
Is ok and has good smell to it. Keeps skin somewhat hydrated, not sure yet on the sea minerals in it and its effects but will keep using and see how it goes. I like Dove for bodywash that or irish spring and dial gold
These gloves fit good and allow you to use your phone with them on. Made of fleece it keeps your hands ok warm, i prefer warmer but these are just normal gloves.
Have had this for months in use even through the past cold winter misery we had in the south and still works. Takes good pictures and battery life is longer than that of some other brands. I wrote to moultrie because of worry of cold temps and operation range and the info they gave me said it would work and it did, the rayovac batteries i had in it didn't die as well! overall for low budget this worked good.
This cable works very nicely and transfers with no issues, the long length is good for making runs or just to use at home.
I like it, easy to install and each has 100watt bulbs you can direct in three directions. Only thing that is kind of annoying is the foam gasket that suppose to help against the wall. I think they should have made that into the part itself to begin with, but hey its made in China. Overall finish is nice and metal, will hold up good. Sensor is adjustable from the outside which is nice as some other lights you have to adjust from the inside.
Easy to connect and setup, it works well for a electronic doorbell. The range we have it is about 4 feet so long distances i'm not sure about. Has many tunes to choose from which would come in handy on holidays etc. For the price it's not too bad.
Very comfortable plushy pillow, when it arrived it contained some letter and business card from the company about who they are and what they believe their product should be, which in my book is a really good thing to do. States is veteran owned which is a plus and made in the u.s.a. another plus. The only thing i wish it had was a zipper on it so i could take just a little of the stuffing out, i like a flat pillow.
Works good, simple design and easily fits in a backpack or portable container. It comes in a bag with all the needed supplies.
only faulty thing is the bracket, it is realllyyyyyy hard to take off the watch besides that i liked it.
I sure am glad i bought this game! :-) It's a great game, that puts your thinking skills to the test
Good energy product for cycling, it saves a lot of space, you can carry them in your pocket, its great.
perfect fit for galaxy note,  but when heated from sun it became so loose and you can not adjust it to the angle you want.
Purchased this case for my son, great case, heavy duty and cheap. Will reorder in the future.Cases are way cheaper than store purchase
Je suis tres satisfait de mon subwoofer , livraison rapide et de qualit&eacute; et un bon service de votre part, merci!
I ordered this on a rush for an expo that I decided to do at the last minute.  It arrived quickly and was absolutely perfect for the expo.  The only way it could have been better is if I had laundered out the fold lines and silk screened my logo on the front.  Plenty of time to do that before the next one.
it was a little short for my taste but otherwise the dress was just fine, I ended up giving it to my niece
bigger than i expected but will keep it anyway.
Lives up to its description. Settings are a little confusing for a first time user. Other than that I liked it.
I will be completely honest... chapter 1 really lost me. I was not into the idea of a teenage love story, so I put the book away and decided not to read it. A few days later I saw a YouTube video of Teri telling her story about writing the book and where the story is headed. (YouTube link here [...] The video made me very curious, so I picked the book back up and dove right into chapter 2. From there I read chapters 2-14 without hardly breathing, I was so excited! I absolutely loved where the book went, and I am ecstatic anticipating the next books! Good job Teri!
This game is ok. Do not like the graphics quite as much as alot of these types of games but it is fun to play. The graphics are good and ot works well
This book was fast  to read. Nice simple story lines. Would read it again. Wasn't much of a surprise but a nice simple story.
I chose this rating because it doesn't work quite as well on the kindle but still works pretty good and I really like having several fun games to play on one app. These games are a little better than a lot of the apps I have for the kindle.
great graphics.. loads fast. no problems until i unlocked the 4th level game. wont unlock even w wi-fi connection..  ??? otherwise, awesome game!!!
I had this about 2 years ago and came to amazon and found it its been a while so the gloss has a new application but i still love it i will be ordering more
I like my product...I wasn't to pleased with the strong smell when I opened it but I washed it and wore it and it's serving it's purpose..
This book was not as good as past works in the Artemis Fowl series however it is still great read
1 They are a lot smaller than I expected. 2 I can buy these pillows at wal greens and big lots for 5 to 10 dollars. When I saw the commercial it looked like something never made before but its the same stuff they use in those cheap pillows at the drugstore. So I was a little disappointed but it's OK. The seller was great!!!! Everything I wrote about that was a problem was my own mistake the seller wrote the dimensions and I expected something without doing my own homework. I am saving her/him the seller and I will be doing business with her/him again
MY PARENTS LOVED THEM. ENJOYED THAT THEY COULD BE WORN ON HAND BUT ALSO WEAR AROUND THEIR NECK. BEAUTIFUL AND WORTH THE PRICE.
the car now works fine, just I as expected, it fit perfectly and solve the starting problem and iddle issues
If you liked candy crush, you'll love this game even more. The best part is that it's free. I definitely do not regret downloading this app!
VERY GOOD SHOE, THE COLORS ARE CUTE AND WIFE BECAME VERY MU AGREE WITH THEM.SHE FEELS VERY COMFORTABLE TO WALK
For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]Laurel is fifteen years old. She is not an ordinary teenager. She eats only fruits and vegetables and drinks Sprite. Since she was a child, she was home schooled on her family land near Orick, California, but when her parents decide to move to Crescent City, she has, for the first time in her life, to go to public school. Her first days at Del Norte High School are difficult, but soon she meets David, the handsome and sweet science nerd and Chelsea. But a hump starts to grow on her back. At first she thinks it's a pimple, her first!, but it grows day by day, becoming difficult to hide. She soon discovers that a flower grows on her back. That's when Laurel is embedded in a tale of magic, intrigue, love and danger where she meets Tamani, a faery, and other evil creatures.Although the start was a bit slow, I could not stop reading from about the fiftieth page. I don't know exactly what happened or what changed, but it gets better. I started and finished it the same night. The idea behind the book is very original. I admit not having read many books about fairies, but the concept seemed pretty original to me. I look forward to learn more about Avalon and fairies in the next novels because we didn't learn a lot in this one.I loved, loved, LOVED Tamani. I think he's the reason why I loved this book so much. His dialogues made me laugh every time and his relationship with Laurel is so much more exciting and intense than the relationship of Laurel and the other guy, I loved every of their scenes when they were together! Their romance was charming. And I loved the end! For those who read the book, you may know why!Something I didn't like was how some characters reacted. The first scene I can think of is when Laurel tells David about her blossom. I found his reaction completely unreal. How could someone be so calm when learning something this strange...Still, it's a novel I recommend. It's an easy, light read, perfect for people who are looking for an entertaining book! I can't wait to read Spells! The book cover is really simple yet cute. After reading it, I can say the wings formed with flower petals fit the story perfectly.
Enjoyable books.  You wish for a hero you find in each of these books and dream of being the lucky girl involved. I will be looking for more books from this author.
The game left so much room for a back story.  This series fills it in nicely.  A great read so far.
It does its job!!will buy another one for my highs..always loved old school brands... Beats anyother amp I have bought
Its good for a quickie. A Wiccan woman is hired to help a werewolf find his mate to insure his pack's future. But she's closer than either one of them realize. I want to find longer books from Hanson I like her writing style.
A Great Read! Someone needs to make this into a movie: Magyver mixed with Mission Impossible! Very difficult to put down once you start.
Good story and leaves the story open for a sequel. This will make a rival to the Hobbit, but has heaps of character commentry and social comment.
After reading the sample of Absorbed I had to find out what the deal was with the overly passive woman Violet and her secretly abusive boyfriend Mick. Everyone loves \life is more fun when he's around\ Mick, however, behind closed doors he's a jerk. But when Violet receives a beautiful gift from a secret admirer, things change for everybody. A straightforward and good horror story.
I liked how the layout of the pouches were. They held all my tools that I need. I hate making many trips to the truck so I carry everything in my pouches so that part was great. Also, the suspenders didn't hinder my overhead reach much compared to other suspenders that I've tried. Being an electrician I often do work off ladders, having arm movement is a must so that was nice.  The biggest problem I had was that I wore the belt a week and it started fraying around the metal gromits. At first I just took a lighter and melted the nylon but it soon became too much of a problem for being a new belt.
Some are a little hard but its a really good game. I am glad some are hard though because i like a challenge.
Great suction from such a small cannister!  Really gets up cat litter from rugs!  Easy to manuveur around furniture and also good on bare floors
My granddaughter choose the &#34;Paris Theme&#34; for her bedroom. she likes the modern look more than the &#34;old fashioned&#34; as she called it.I have to steer away from &#34;to much Eiffel Tower&#34; as she wants more variety than just that. Amazon has a better variety than say Hobby Lobby which tends to cater to a younger girls, you know pink, sparkly...that sort of thing is just not Destiny anymore.
I love that I can sit anywhere in the room and still charge my ipad. It was a good deal.
It was exactly what I thought it would be. I ordered it for my husband and it has survived him. That is really saying something because he is rough.
i would recommend this book  i did like it but i know that another book will b e in the making after reading this one .
Overall well written, sometimes Koontz is hit or miss, this  time he hit.  The Odd Thomas series has been enjoyable, look forward to the next one.
I have purchased an airbrush from harbor freights it was ok while it lasted. I have asked people around and did my own research on certain airbrush products. The ones most airbrush artist use is &#34;iwata&#34; or so I have seen. I am just beginning so I know others have their own perks, but by far this is the best I have held and used and now I am starting off seeing the true difference in my art work. Really like this product
These small soaps look like they really came from the seashore.  They are so attractive in my soap dish, that I hope no one ever uses them!
I have learned so much from the studie of making pasta.  This book is one of the bibles.  Thank you.
Very cute charm necklace set, picked it up for me and my sis. I felt a bit worried after reading the reviews that the chain itself was a bit flimsy, but as long as you're not running a marathon or doing construction work in it, it should be fine. Even then, I still recommend getting a new chain for it, just in case. The charms themselves are high-quality and very pretty! My sister loves hers and I've been wearing mine everywhere. Product also arrived much earlier than expected, thanks! If you're a Miku fan who likes things like this, or even just someone looking for a cute set of necklaces, I'd recommend!
I have 3 small dogs, so it is a little challenging trying to work with them together; however, this is the first training program we've tried that is working.  We have definitely seen an improvement and will continue to use it to reach our goal of having dogs we can take anywhere and know they will behave well.
It's more pretty for the white touch and feels comfortable and light. But the actual color is a little darker than that showed
Gave this to my 12 Yr. old For his 12th Birthday. He Loves it! Good Buy for the money.I would Recommend this product For this age group any time.
Fun game for my kids they enjoy doing the battles and trying to build up their defence with each other's help
It is really worth reading book. I'll recommend it for all interested in Baltic countries. Gives you a comprehensive insight into the history of Baltic states.&#8203;
I found this book a very interesting read.  It took a different slant on the zombie profile, which was refreshing.  The characters were energetic, intelligent, and likable.  A thoroughly enjoyable read.
The pages flew by in this page turner.  Jack stumbles onto a Big case that involves child kidnapping.  It leads to nowhere you would have thought.  Great plot, excellent characters, and moving situations.
A top investigator comes to Ireland to start training newbies to become CSI.  On her first investigation, she finds signs that several crimes have been perpetrated by a sadistic and brutal serial killer and linked them together.  Of course, the police chief doesn't agree with her methods.  This book was a fast read, with a big twist, good plot and great characterisations.
A very informative and helpful guide to what needs to be changed to make the US system of government today more answerable to the people
I recently bought this for myself but my daughter Beautiful color I like it but when she saw this she just had to have it so I gave it to her and she was eager to watch Netflix to play games in the music videos At times is a little complicated for her to Navigate but she likes it But I would definitely be buying her an iPad mini Since it's more educational Over all a great buy
i like because is fit nice. I love it. I will order more and i recommend for any one who like to be comfit.
Loved the trilogy - kept me in love.  I'm a true romantic and loved their story. Totally loved it. Yes
Was a little skeptical, especially for the price, but it works just like the name brand! Just soak in water and all sorts of marks disappear. The only thing that would make it better is a scrubber pad on one side for stubborn marks. Will definitely purchase again!
This is a nice start to a new series.  I am looking forward to the next installment!My only complaint would be the same as other &#34;1st&#34; books in series, lots of background to set the stage for the series.  Though I guess I would complain if there wasn't enough!  Good read!
When I started this series, I wasn't so sure I would finish it.  A little slow at the start but takes off quickly.  Very interesting plot development, characters are complex and lovable.  I found myself searching for more by this author.  Definitely worth the price.  If you enjoy the zombie genre you will thoroughly enjoy each of these books.
This game is alot of fun, keeps you interested in playing.  I am glad I Saw this game to download on my Kindle.
I dislike the loading time of This program, Compared to Sony Vegas Pro, it is very slow to startup. I do like that it has a green screen that comes with it. Overall it is a Great product. Please do consider buying.
I ordered 120 of these lights. Only 2 of 120 did not work, but my fiance managed to fix them both.There were 4 batteries that didn't work as well.I didn't receive any extra batteries in my order like the description stated. Otherwise, I'm happy with the lights.I also tested one out last night submerged in water.I put it in at 8pm, this morning when I left for work at 7am, it was still working fine
Jeannette Walls portrays her story in a humorous way that touches you & makes you believe in hope & that anyone can get through anything to reach their goals.
Loved the message and we always love the videos with a positive girl message :) You can't go wrong with Veggie Tales!
i don't think it's a 5star product. the fog lifter is 5 star I prefer columbian  over a blend, but they have done a good job of blending
If you are a fan of Elizabeth II this book is definitely a must read. It's quite informative, but not judgemental. The only objection I had was to much focus on politics and queen's relationship with her prime ministers and far to little information about her family and other aspects of her life.
I think this game is fun. I also like this sort of game. If you enjoy hidden objects games you will like this.
Item as described. Fast shipment. Color was a little dull in comaprison with the picture but I am over all happy with this otter box cover.
This hook is really pricey but it does what it supposed to.Gladiator has a cheaper bike hook to hang vertically, but i still prefer this horizontal bike hook.
The board, bank notes and cards are very nicely decorated with the Yellow submarine film's characters/scenes. The only thing I don't like much is that &#34;houses&#34; and &#34;hotels&#34; are named &#34;friends&#34; and &#34;submarines&#34; but the plastic figures are still the same classic houses and hotels. It would have been great if &#34;submarines&#34; were actually yellow submarines.
.It's a fun game to play and its what I look for in a hidden object game. It's the best I've played in a while
I was searching for a good zoom lense, I narrowed down my search to 70-300mm and 55-250mm IS II. I did lota reasearch and selected 55-250mm IS IIIS II specificaly coz as the name suggest IS &#34;image stabilization&#34; and I needed it badly since I was not a pro then but after 6 months of use, I say this is the one that I needed. Yes the price, It is resonable for an IS II and I didn't have plans of spending more, otherwise I would have gone for 70-300mm IS.
I received it at my FPO AP address right on time, which was a surprise, usually mail runs late, which also means if I was at a regular shipping address it would have come early. I was impressed by that, now I am just waiting to see if they trim off that last little bit of fat I want off.
Ordered mine about a week after two of my friends, and got mine before them! this is a good buy. nice hat, and you have room on the front to customize it!
got it in the mail faster than I expected and it came out really cute! love the color and still have it intact and all. Looks great on my phone and I have dropped it a couple of times and its still on there (:
This case is good. I have enjoyed it very much. The quaility is awesome and easy to use. Thank you. :)
I purchased this for my brother's PC after his other charger broke, and he says that it fits into his computer and works well.  So, it is what it claims to be.
I liked this book because it was different. Very descriptive, exciting, and I hated having it to end. I would like to read more books from this author.
The shirt is Thin so you need to wear a tank top under it. It fits on the smaller side of the scale but i also like my shirts a little lose. Overall I am happy with it.
My only suggestion is to work on getting rid of the dark fuzzy shadowing at the bottom of the screen.
It does a decent job of removing 85% of the hair from the root, but the rest just gets cut down really short, I have seen the hair come back slower and thinner as it should. And I am using it in conjunction with the Kalo Hair Inhibitor treatment. I have reviewed that product as well for those of you whom may be interested.
A classic and too clear economic book. I completly recommend this book and the rest of Austrian Economie's books. Lius
It's a fun way to kill time. If you run out of game boosters I just go to the Plano room. You can refill and not make any purchases. It's great.
I loved these earrings but they ended up breaking for no apparent reason I couldn't fix them. I had just gotten them. but I would recommend to anyone who likes them they look just like the picture and they came a couple days after I ordered them.
The case has proven to be very effective and somewhat stylish I will be ordering my future accessories this way from now on
Great for 4 year old just a little bit smaller then what i thought it would be but still great
We have viewed many lighthouses on the east coast and have collected a few. But this one was for a special friend thatwe had traveled with and just lost her husband.  A special memories, so to speak.
The only reason I didn't give a five was because it gave the impression that Hank was only married once. From what I understand he was married a second time and I feel it was an insult to his second wife that she was not included in this movie. I understand it gave a better ending the way it was done, but when watching a so called true to life story, that is what I want it to be; not just another of those Hollywood jerks changing things the way they want. Still I had seen this movie two times before and wanted it in my collection along with Jerry, Elvis, Holly, Richie, Cold miner's daughter and others.
Movie wanted as a whim...happy I did. Was an unexpected pleasure. Guy Pearce and the young girl were wonderful together.
it's good, but it's not for everyone. the game has some annoying dubbing, granted they are just as annoying in japanese as well, o well that is what we get for asking dual audio, the english version always turns out shit.
Sunday morning lounging and drive music if i have ever heard it. Makes me wonder why it never became popular in the States. A true British invasion of dreamy attitude and super sounds
My daughter loves this learning tool and fits nicely with the ABA Therapy we are also doing. Both family and therapists find the Cash Register easy to use and very life-like.We especially like the credit card processing facility on the register.Only one thing I would suggest is to please add the ability to change the Currency type to the Australian Dollar for example.  That would make it perfect.
This game is ok, I wish this game was a little bit more entertaining.This game is perfect to fall asleep.
After more than a month of use, the Infrared units are holding up great. The Beam is very powerful and can be reflected off things across the room and then come back and hit the eye. The wire supplied wasnt bad either, but the splicing connectors, even though they are of genius design, end up cutting the wire too much and losing connection. I ended up replacing all the existing wire and splicing the new units in the old fashioned way with just a twist and some electrical tape. Other than that, works fine.
This is a really great knife, as long as you know a good, experienced knife sharpener.Pros -This is a really solid knife all around, great handle, great balance and feel, not too heavy not too light, and comes with a nice sheath. Feels very durable and is very comforting to have while in the backyard at night.Cons -This knife came to me not as sharp as i would expect from Ka-Bar. It's sharp enough for daily use, but it aint cuttin no arm hair. Real deal knives are supposed to be able to shave hair. I will be taking this to a good sharpener as soon as i find one. Had to take a star off for this.
This is a good beanie, but it has a few things that could be better. The shape of the beanie is a little cone-ish. It could also be a little thicker to protect from wind and cold. Other than that, the fabric is nice feeling and well stitched, no loose threads so far. It is also very comfortable once you get it situated, and also stays in place alot better than most beanies if you have long hair.
This light is one of the best USB lights ive owned. I play PC Games in a dark garage at night, and the Red light is perfect for illuminating the laptop keyboard and whatever else i need to see. The 3 light levels are cool, but the button feels a bit loose and wobbly, but so far has taken all my punishment. The neck is very bendable and twistable and seems to not want to twist at the connection base of the the USB plug, wich is good so the internal cord wont twist up and snap. Overall a great product and the ONLY Red LED USB Light you'll find out right now.
I think it is enough for you using is very easy and also cleaning. it is worth for this prize
This was a very good read. It kept thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading the book. I hope that part 2 is even better.I recommended this book to a couple of very close friends.
This movie was made with feeling and i liked how school friends ended up as lover and the fact that people thought that u can be gay from drinking the water was funny
reading it you can give it no less then 5 star.stop running to find what's in you heartand being to live.
Really cute phone case, but very difficult to get off of my phone. Still cute and I'm glad I bought it
I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer of the right breast -- second time around for me after being cancer free for 16+ years.  A lot of great changes have taken place since my first surgery (1997), a lumpectomy and lymphnode excision followed by radiation; e.g. sentinel node biopsy (made standard of practice 1 yr. following my surgery); Oncontype DX test.  Through Dr. Love's Breast Book, I learned about the advancements made since 1997, and learned about the pros and cons of aromatase inihibitors.  One big change since my first cancer in 1997, is that chemotherapy is not always the adjuvant treatment of choice depending on the type of cancer.  I learned from Dr. Love's book that because I am estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and the fact that I am negative for HER-2/neu, my cancer would not benefit from chemotherapy.  This was confirmed by my doctors.  For these reasons and others, I have opted for a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  I have been informed that I will be admitted for only 23 hrs. following surgery, not the &#34;few days&#34; admission stated in the book.  That is the only thing in my experience I have found different from that presented in the book.  I found the book very beneficial in that it made me a more informed patient and therefore able to communicate better with my medical team.
This is an awesome series whether or not you're an anime fan. I used to watch this show back when it was on Cartoon Network (back when that channel had more shows I actually wanted to watch). If you're already starting to get into anime, this series is a can't miss.
The cards I got were pretty well what I expected. All of them were in excellent shape. I loved that there were some cards that came from cereal box specials and others like that. It's a good buy for a kid or someone starting a collection. The only thing I have a problem with is that they didn't actually come in a card box.
These were very comfy, but run big and wide and therefor tend to slip at the heel. I returned them as the slip factor was a problem for me. Would make great house shoes, slippers etc.
I wear these in Maine and often in deep snow, to hike and to take my boys sledding, clamming on the mud flats etc. they were very stiff and a little tight fitting out of the box, but after a few wearings they have proven to be very comfortable and warm. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that despite the cinch top, snow does come into the top of the boots. The top is fabric and snow makes it droop down and eventually gets your socks wet. This is only a problem if you are walking in snow over a foot deep. I solved that problem by wearing them under my pants in deep snow.
These are not lingerie, they are simple, comfortable stay put undies. Very thin. They do the job. I would not recommend putting them in the dryer.
when buying items (electronics) it is well worth the protection plan offered (square trade) is there to back up the product! if the event, i have any product issue.
I like these sandals but the strap is a little tight around the toe.  It may be because I wore them for the first time while out walking for a long day in DC.  They are super cute and overall comfortable.  I think if the leather stretches a little, I will be fine.  The sole is a little rubbery but it doesn't take away from the sandal.
Gave a good picture of how poor this area of the country was and how tied to the coal mines the people were.  The characters were interesting, had some flair. It was a good, enjoyable book.
its good i couldnt get free and it is also soft on the wrists i like it a lot :3
My only negative is that it moves so slow. The purchasing of the items and then having to wait so long for completion. I really like that it offers opportunity to earn the coins, so many games only offer the purchase of them, so that is a big plus. So if you make any improvements based on reviews I hope to see faster turn around on the game. :)
I have been adamant about losing at least 40 pounds since the start of the new year. I saw the details for this and thought that it could help me to start losing weight again . My goal was to lose a total of 55 lbs which I've been trying to lose . Before I stopped losing weight I had lost a total of 21 pounds. I hit a plateu of course but am now seeing pound for pound drop. No jitters for me was a plus.
Bought this puzzle for my son. He loves it, but it chips quickly with daily play. Just something to keep in mind if you're concerned about it staying in perfect condition.
Cute toy, my son loves it! Expect the paint to chip and fade quickly, however. Wooden toys don't stay nice in the hands of kids! Otherwise, a great purchase and well-loved toy!
SPOILERS INCOMING!!!It was a great book but a bit disappointing compared to all the other books because Artemis had the Atlantis complex and he so he wasn't coming up with his normal schemes and half the time he wasn't even Artemis he was that Orion guy who was really weird. All in all it just wasn't quite as intriguing as some of the previous books.
a very helpful tool to have laying around the studio and its laminated so it cleans easy for all the messy musicians out there and its very cheap
The figurines were all good, their faces were properly painted. They are the perfect size. Most of them fit into their stands... One of the black sticks didn't fit into the stand. Otherwise, the figurines themselves are very nice.
I haven't finished the book, but it is very informative and enjoyable to read.  A lot of time and research was devoted to writing this book...loved it!
This product was recommended by a physician assistant for providing relief for nerve pain.  I haven't had the opportunity to try it yet, but it was new, shipped promptly and I can't wait to use it!
I have been using this product for years.  I recommend it highly. It lifts and firms around the eyes and  I see an instant difference when my eyes are puffy.  I've used other products with no results.  Everyone's tissue is different and not every product works the same way.  This product works great for me!
We have had this base installed for about a month now but the bathroom remodel isn't finished yet so we haven't been able to use the shower. It looks nice and the quality seems pretty good. Delivery took awhile but being such a large size the local stores didn't stock it.
So far I like the case. It seems light and convenient compared to the previous cases I had for my old iPad. I do wish it had a screen protector built into the case. I haven't really traveled much with this one yet but the iPad Air and this case are definitely easier and lighter in my purse then the old one.
I got the item and its very cool but you have to be careful because its very fragile. I put a bunch of music on it and plugged it into my cars usb and it couldn't read it. I have never heard of different types of usb software but im sure ill figure it out. Like I said though,its not to be played with like a toy.
This mask is pretty cool. I actually bought it for a friend of mine to wear when he plays the drums in his shows. He loves it. Like the other reviews said though the foam padding is kinda lame but im sure something else can be figured out.
I actually bought this album as a christmas gift for my brother in law but I still like there stuff.
Really a great read and thankfully not a full on love story. It was pretty well written except a few areas toward the end the paragraphs got a little confusing as to who's side you were reading about. I genuinely enjoyed the fact to that this starts after the wars and doesn't drag you thru anything but the necessary and important ones.
Although this book may not appear as good as its brothers it is really important to link the story together its a bit like the 4 book it has a serious twist which may ruin it in some views .This book is brilliant for the Alex Rider fan club it may get to.your head but be patient it will make sense eventually.
This book is a fast paced and highly humerus this book proves the power of friendship and trust this is the book for any teen reader
recommend for increasing ones knowledge, thus decreasing fears of pets who need a home, and care. pets need love to.
i like this cover , looks so preety on phone, it's hard plastic cover little fragile ... it slips so easily from hand ,and sometimes problem to reach at volume and power button .
Well, yao also use, also don't know whether have effect, texture can still&#65292;Waiting for the use effect&#65292;Listen to the friend say is good
I love haba but for the price , not sure that the expected quality is there --- the stroller is great but the pillow/blanket / mattress are pretty cheap and lumpy. Tags say 'designed and quality of haba Germany' but do not explicitly state made in Germany.... Which leaves me thinking the fabric parts of this item were made at least in part in china , which is what I've been striving to avoid. The whole thing is supposed to be made in Germany but I've got my doubts about the fabric !  That being said, my daughter loves loves loves this stroller ! She uses it all of the time to help with walking. It's  very solid and durable , and came requiring minimal assembly.  It's really an adorable item and the stroller itself is heirloom quality. The stroller itself should get 5 stars but the cheap fabric knocks it down to a 4 star.
My daughter loves this duck! She is 7 months and wants her duckie at all baths. It's cute and small. It doesn't sit upright , but it spends the bath in her mouth anyhow.  Be careful because it will get water in it- squeeze out the duck after each bath to avoid any issues.  Not made in china , hooray
These are cute and reposition well--- I went through a few remove and re-sticks and have had no problems so far.
I seem to have very good luck with this company I'm going to continue to buy they make the cutest sets thank you
It's beautiful and even shinier and more sparkly in person. It seems like its good quality. I have only had it for a week. I am hoping the gold doesn't tarnish quickly.
Easy, portable, good sound, but the battery only lasts about 3 hours.
I loved the book, and while it was a tad bit short (2 sittings...) I find that I got attached to the characters rather fast, and wanted to know more about them. I didn't like the ending however, seeing as it was kind of sudden. I could see it coming, but I went to the kindle store to get the second book in the series, but either they don't have it, or it isn't out yet. Either way, I can't wait for it! It's pretty cheap, but for being so short I would expect that. 2.99 is a good price though. Just hope the next book won't be any more than that. (Unless it's a couple-hundred pages longer :P)
A very complicated book,  that I don't really feel was intended just for the average reader,  although,  I can't allow my own lack of knowledge over the subject affect my review. This book I about exactly what it states,  a voyage in a balloon,  I came into it believing it was chronicling the voyage of the men who landed on the island in the book &#34;The Mysterious Island&#34;... It doesn't,  not even close,  still,  it was an interesting read,  and worth the time spent on it.
For being free it was a great book. If you want a quick little read that's a little creepy then go for it!
It only took me 20 minutes to read it, and it was surely worth it :) It was a tad bit confusing at one point, but at the end I tied it all together, and had a good laugh! Definetly would recommend it.
If you think you may want to read this book, do it! It's well worth the time it takes to read it. The story is original, the characters likable and an easy to follow read. The writing can get a little rough, but the imagery is usually pretty good, and you get a good idea of what everything looks like, and it leaves just the right amount to the imagination. I'm not going to ruin the story by nit-picking every scene, read if for yourself and form your own opinion.
Liked the book.  Kept your interest.  Characters were good and interesting.  Would recommend.
Game is another option of using the Kindle.  If you tired of reading or watching videos you have the option of playing games.  Play the games when we travel.  Makes time go by faster.  B
it works very good - good reception good soundthe only thing is the one i had before this - the head piece was adjustable and this one is not - so it is a little big for head and i always feel it is falling off. Other than that i like it alot.nancy norris
Great pillow !!!!!
I like it, except there is ventilation. I get all sweaty even when it's little cold outside. Can not wear it much in SF bay area.
While it's not the game I remember, it's still a bit of fun. If you've enjoyed games like frontier ville you'll probably enjoy this. Could use an easier energy refresh.
works perfectly...i would recommend this charger to anyone.i can plug my phone up when i get in the car and know that i will have a full charge
I have received the Squeeze & Teethe Lamb from Infantino to facilitate my review.&#8221;My 2 month old son loves this lamb.  It is easy for him to grab and he smiles every time he sees it.  The soft material is perfect for him to suck on.  I am excited to see how he plays with the toy once he gets older.  This is his go to toy at playtime!
Unit works as advertised. Plug it in and the computer recognizes it. Using windows 7. Using it on the front usb.
i was really excited about this item. It came in the mail, i fueled it up, played with it quite a bit. Loved it. Today, a week after I bought it, it somehow came loose from its lid and fell somewhere . I'm very sad :( . It probably would be better with some kind of latching design so it doesn't get lost easily.  I don't have anything bad to really say about it. It's great. :(
Iin my job as Head-of-maintenance(fancy for&#34;I fix stuff&#34;) ,I carry about 50 keys at all times. I kept getting more keys(still getting more) and needing bigger key rings. As title suggests, I got a large split ring hoping it would solve my problems. It began stretching and distorting. It was difficult to remove and replace keys(as for copying at the locksmith's) and I got fed up and started looking for new options!I found these on Amazon and decided to give them a try. (They arrived early and well packaged) before I'd finished putting all my keys on these new tools, I threw away the split ring, realizing that this was my answer!  I have better accessiblity. I use multiple cables looped on a carabiner and am able to categorize the keys for easy location and it has had the un forseen bbenefit of being more comfortable.The only cons I can see are the screw couplers on the ends. They come unthreaded(unscrewed) periodically and all the keys fall onthe ground.  This is a simple thing to counteract. I put a small bit of tape on the male end when I screw them together. This adds a little needed friction. There are other substances and materials one could use to do the same job.
Good ... I like the fit and feel very comfortable.This needs some more warmth as when you wear that in Cold conditions does not protect you completely.
love them.
bought them for a friend
Fits well
It is a very good cup. The only problem is that the cup came a little lose from the handles.
I have been using this hat for a couple of weeks and really like it.  It fits well and looks really cute.  I like that it is crushable and that I can take it with me in my bag. The quality of the hat is very good.
I just received the dictionary today after placing the order more than one month ago. I visited the post office to check the package by myself and I could finally got it. Around 100 pages were in shrink condition that I have to put them back into their right place. I wonder where those pages started to shrink; is it from the packaging point or at the checking or customs point?.While reading the words and their definitions I found that they are very clear and understandable. Everything almost as perfect as I've been expected to. However, there are things that caused me to conclude that it is only a four starred dictionary. The first is the paper which is too thin, which is easily torn apart. Secondly, there is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Thirdly, I need more encyclopedic definitions about some worldly events like the 9/11 2001 in New York. In my opinion there should be a picture of the \late\ twin towers along with the list of suspects, both individual and organization, and more detailed story about what exactly has happened in the 9/11 event. But most of all, it is a quite satisfying dictionary which must be collected by everyone who is serious in English.
It is a good dictionary with an old fashion performance. There is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Words in the addenda should be inserted into the existing entries. The typing is more like my grandfather's first dictionary printed in Netherlands in 1950s. However, there are some specific elements to let me justified that it is a four starred dictionary. The first is the abundance of word entries which is not found in any other dictionaries. Secondly, the amazing printed size book, which caused other people to think that I might be a great lexicographer while carrying the book. Thirdly, it has been the dictionary of my dream since I was in secondary school. What a subjective reviews!!! I recommend you to have one if you are serious in exploring English through words.
The modern story of Job was well written . A good interpretation of the disasters that job experienced as well as the trying of his faith and the lack of support from his three friends. This helps the reader to better understand the biblical story.  A good read.
An interesting read. Story line was definitely different and was a clean story but still that kept it real.Not bad.
It is a short book that is,well worth the reading.  It is also a,source of  encouragement  to increase  your faith and remind you that God will take care of you.
Thank you very muchVery beautiful.Very comfortable.Bought 7.5 B (M)My foot length 9.6completeness WBut. Shoes were narrow and long.Fit size 8.
enjoy reading and looking into getting the rest in the series as long as they are within my price range
works great just wish the legs bolt in but very good for the price that is and the tub part is made very well 8 out of ten
I like the ending it's a twist on the whole story line I can't wait to read the next book
I was amazed by the ending and I hope they there was a third book in the series it's amazing
Good Read!!! Alot of magic ,Boyle is charming with a patience for Iona which reads true love! Enjoyed so much,couldn't put down.
This is a very nice pendant. I bought it for my wife because it has both our and our sons birth stone. It's really tough to estimate actual size online, and I will say this is a little smaller than I hoped it would be. But still a very nice piece of jewelers.
I bought these for my wife because they have both our and our sons birth stones in them. Tad small, but for earrings that isn't always a bad thing. Very pretty. Recommend.
I LIKE BINGO AND THIS ONE IS VERY GOOD , I CAN SEE THE NUMBER GOOD . THE TIMING BETWEEN  NUMBERS IS THE RIGHT SPEED FOR ME, I CAN  PLAY BINGO ANYWHERE  AND ANYTIME THAT I WANT TO DO .
This is a very nice bra and I love the 2\ band.  I would have given it 5 stars but it DOES run small.  I wear a large in similar bras but this one runs a size small.  Order a size up.
I have to say that I have read all of Bianca D Arc s books they are written so well these books are always good.
Kane's story is very good . The black cougars are always a feisty bunch of cats and their women are some of the bravest to be seen.
Wow what a good book I am going to read more about this family. Going to start the next book and I just hope it is as good as this one was.
This was a good book with the writing of a few good writers. It was a little silly but the work itself was good.
It started out slow but really got to be a good book. A little steamy. But it was a really good book.
It's a good read if you like ALOT OF  sex very detailed sexual situations . So if you don't like full sex it is not for you.
It's hard to get a really good book and I am going to say that this one was just great. The only problem I have with it was it was to short.
I was just surprised at this book it was great. Well written so glad to read more about this family and friends.
A great beginning to the series. Starts slow but picks up and keeps you interested to the end. I loved the story line it will be great to start the next book to see where this will go.
This book picks up where the last one was. It was a really great book and I have to say I loved it.
This device has a great sound for a wireless bluetooth speaker.  It also works well as a speaker phone.  I would recommend this product.
It serves its purpose. Isn't super strong neither weak. Can't resist an impact or a high drop but to protect and storage equipment ain't bad.
Its ok I guess for the price. However, it is hard to iron, has so many wrinkles that if you don't play with the lights will show up in the pictures. Besides that, everything else is fine.
The storage unit is nice, and I love that it is stackable. I bought these to organize my garage. The only negative thing I would say is that these storage containers are expensive. You can get cheaper stackable units at Walmart.
So glad I bought the costume! The only down side about the costume is the sizing.  I'm 5'5\, 138lbs...and i usually wear medium. Since they didn't have just a medium i went with the med/lg and it's def a little big in the chest area, so I wore a light blue tank top underneath it and it was perfect!  The zipper wasn't an issue for me at all.  All you need to do is fluff up the skirt when you get it.  The hood was in great condition, that just needs a little fluffing up too. You def need to get the leg warmers with the costume.  I wore this to a halloween party and everyone loved it!
Once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Zombie fans like me will definitely enjoy it. The story is plausible and the zombies are more realistic than some of the ones you find in other books. Lee, the main character, is realistic enough so you develop empathy and root for him. Put it this way, it's good enough for me to buy the remaining books, pun intended.
This was a very disturbing book. I know BATF guys that were involved in the Waco debacle. They are decent guys. However, I do understand the main character wanting his pound of flesh. While freedom is free keeping it isn't. The main character and his pain, could be any gun owner in America, but he has the ability to extract a price for something that should rarely, if ever happen in a \free\ country. On a side note, the spelling needs to be fixed but the spelling Nazis made some spelling errors when they criticized TJ. CMU (Cracked Me Up).  It saddens me deeply to know this is no longer fringe thinking in our country.
The watch looks great, feels great, great price, awesome watch box! Only downside was that the color of the dial to change the date and time is faded. Instead of red its pink. Other than that, awesome.
Awesome game for its time. The game play may not be the best, The graphics are horrible by todays standards but its very fun and the reminiscent value is priceless
It piqued my interest from the start and held it to the end.  Great character development.  I wil read more from this author.
I like it very much but it drives me crazy.  I don't understand all the nuances and therefore have won only a few games.
Goood
A good read. Alt of characters kept the plot interesting and so south Florida. Amazingly enough there is truth behind these types of folly. Being a true Floridian, I can say this. I would have liked more closure to the end, that's the negative. The pluses are is a light read, great Serge energy, and great facts. It's always a treat to read Dorsey with his use of real Florida landmarks.. thank you for that.
This was a very good basic book. Some stuff is intuitive, some new. I really enjoyed the companion planting guide.
Good instruction. Covers material type and briefly covers construction making the process feel do-able. Also goes over planting. I wish we has pictures.
A simple book with tasty recipes. I'm not sure about it lasting 7 days because I've not tried it but I plan on it soon. What a great idea very simple. Although a mason jar is all that is suggested I still being a bowl to dump the contents. For the size I make the jar get cumbersome eat out of. Great salad recipes. Thanks.
I don't like the fact you need to use your own real money in this. it pisses me off. over all I think that its fun and my little sister likes it.
I would recommend this book to anyone obsessed with serial killers. I didn't like that some questions didn't have enough information.
I ordered these to go with the rest of the bedding ensemble and this was a pleasing alternate to other curtains.
The case is a little big for just the tablet.  it is designed to hold the tablet and the keyboard.  It still works very well as the tablet only moves a little inside the case.  The pocket for the stylus is a great addition because the surface has no way of storing it otherwise.  Overall good product.
What can I say about it... it&#699;s a basic belt.  It fits, it works, and I like it. Nothing fancy, just a belt to hold up my fatigues or tactical pants.... and I can hang my sidearm holster, and a couple of mags on it as well.  I wanted something low profile, because if I wear a battle belt over it, I didn&#699;t want a big buckle on my pants as well as a cobra buckle on the battle belt.  This is great for what it is.  I gave it 4 stars only because I don&#699;t actually LOVE IT... but I like it alot and it serves its intended purpose well. Buy it.
I was hoping the front sight wouldn&#699;t extend over the cut out on the top of my Glock 34...and it doesn&#699;t!  It fits just fine.  Tritium glows at dusk, and really glows in darkness!  I left it in the box it shipped in, and then pulled it out in pitch darkness...and it was glowing just fine.  For the price...I&#699;ll put these on my Glock 17 as well!
I wasn&#699;t sure if this light was going to be bright enough...but it&#699;s PLENTY bright!  I use this LED bar on the top of my light bar tripod...and I hang a vertigo and Revo Rave under it... and it&#699;s perfect.  I&#699;ll probably end up buying a 2nd Mega Pixel LED bar, and use two of them linked master/slave and run those on my truss. This ONE bar will light up a medium sized room all by itself.
I just picked up TWO of the 7-1/2 inch scissors.  One for my First Aid kit at home, and one for my personal IFAK kit that goes in my truck, hunting, shooting, camping, etc. My first impression was: Wow...this is BIG.  It's a pretty big size shears.  After reading other reviews, it looks like the smaller set might be a little too small for big hands.  I may order a small set for my personal kit, because this one doesn't quite fit inside. I have to strap it to the outside of my kit.  Overall...I like them. I haven't used them enough yet to LOVE them...but I'm sure if I ever have to use them in an emergency...they'll be awesome.
There are a ton of reviews out there on this particular knife.  It caught my eye on knifecenter.com so I decided to take a closer look and looked at reviews here on Amazon as well as YouTube.  There are some really good reviews on YouTube. Overall I like this knife.  I bought it to give away as a gift, but I may end up buying another one to keep.I bought the straight blade, not serrated, which is what I prefer. I think the blade steel is decent quality.  It&#699;s the same steel as my Spyderco Tenacious, strong enough, and able to sharpen up fairly easily.  I like the handle grip, it&#699;s very good and feels comfortable in hand. No blade play up, down, or side to side when it&#699;s deployed.  I like the secondary lock on the top of the frame.  That&#699;s a nice added safety feature.  I&#699;m not too keen on the pocket clip.  That looks a little...low-tech if I can say that.  I wish it was a little more agressive looking and not so FAT.  And then the knife overall is a little wide.Other than that I have no real complaints.  These are my first impressions right out of the box...and I haven&#699;t actually put it to use, BUT...I can tell this knife will take a beating. The good news: It&#699;s not a hundred dollar knife that I&#699;ll be afraid to put to hard use.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#699;s a little wider than expected, and that silly looking pocket clip.
This is exactly what I wanted for my Mosin.  It&#699;s the kit, and only thing missing is the little oil container. But no big deal... I run my boresnake thru it instead.  But I got it for the spacer tool for the bolt assembly.  Works good.
Very nice and beautiful.  Easy to put together. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my GSD/Dobie figured out how to open the gate in no time at all!
Great toy and highly educational.  You can program your childs name so it will call her by name. The only problem I have is that you have to watch so your childs fingers do not get pinched.  Mine loves to open and close things!  Highly recommend!
looks nice on the counter and my fruits finally have a place. makes the kitchen very organized and neat. thanks
the kids really enjoy the trucks from this set! they'll play with that over many other additions to my duplo lego
It was exactly what I saw when I was shopping for it. Occasionally the color can get waited online, and you will see it as a different color than it is. But I was surprised to see that it was the exact color that I had thought it would be, and just what I was looking for. A great fit!
it's pretty comfy, though there are some minor glitches in the design. the ridges are slightly skewed (ca. 1.0mm), but it's not a problem. a pity there aren't more of them, the farthest it can go is ca. 40 degrees.
My gf sister like this product. Price is okay and also the quality.Thanks!!!Pros: Nice and smooth quality.Cons: Nothing.
Easy read, interesting and some little known information, will make a good gift for my erudite friends--and for some who think they are!
Great looking range hood. the only marks against it is that the fan is much noisier than expected and the lights are not as bright as expected.
These are issue, circa 91. You can not beat it for the price, especially thinking about what our careless government spent on these. If you use a built in magazine pull like the ones on Troy battlemags or the slip on variety such as Magpul magazine pulls, the flaps on this will not even come close to snapping. If your using duct tape and 550 cord, maybe, thats a BIG maybe they will snap close. Its a tight fit. If your using plain pmags, troy battlemags, promag, gi steel mags, or colt mags (all 30 rounders) then they should snap for you.Its not a bad idea to buy 2 of these and keep one loaded and another one full of empty mags that you rotate every 6mo, that way if the S ever does HTF then you should have 7 mags ready to go (one in your rifle), standard combat load for US troops is 210 rounds, 7 mags.
I would recommend this book to everyone that enjoy s  a clean story. With no bad language. Very good story.
Ordered for my Mother to keep in her purse while she travels. Will be nice to have  just in case she wants to write about the trips.
Love the black eyed peas ad love dancing if you love both i recommend they have a wide variety of the black eyed peas songs
pretty cool tuner, i spent time online lookin for a good worth tuner and i gotta say i found it. i like the other features it comes with it, i can switch the tempo to go faster or lower. overall pretty cool!
4.5 starsAlthough I didn't expect it to, this book made me feel a lot and in the end, I sighed and smiled. This was such a beautiful story. Both sad and full of hope and love and friendship.Caroline's grandmother is very sick, probably dying. Along with her family, Caroline has been by her side since the stroke. With so much pressure building, all she wants is to escape and when Simone, her best friend, offers to take her to a party on that fateful Friday night, she ends up at a crossroads . Will she stay with her grandma? Or go to the party with Simone? Her decision splits her fate into two different paths and she's about to live them both. But which one is the right one?Oh my god, this boo is just... Epic. It's so damn relatable too. It's insane. The writing is great, I felt so much reading this book. Probably because a lot of people can relate to this. The story has three parts. Before, Stay and Go. First we have Before and after that you have one chapter Stay, the next Go and after that again Stay and so on. I liked the perspective that gave me. We saw how each of the two choices affected her life and family and friends and even love-life. Yeah, maybe it was a bit predictable, but honestly? I don't care. It was just a beautiful, amazing story and it ended just as I hoped it would and that's all that really matters in the end for me.I really liked the characters. Caroline is very easy to relate to. I mean, I know how she felt most of the time because I've been there. I understood it. I loved Simone and Natalie and Teddy and Chris and maybe even Joel. And I loved how everything blended together in the end. So beautiful!Amazing book with more depth to it than I expected at first and written so beautifully. I absolutely recommend this book to everyone who ever lost a loved one and everyone who is fortunate enough to have never gone through that pain.Warning! This book can and probably will make you cry. Especially if you cry easily while reading a book like this. It's a sob-fest, that's for sure. So.. better keep the Kleenex close!
Honestly, this is not a genre I usually read. No, correction. This is not a genre I usually enjoy. But I did! I enjoyed this book! Surprisingly so.So, in this book the earth is dying. It's overrun and destroyed by humanity. The 'world government' has terraformed a new planet and is slowly bringing people to that planet. It has several POV's, both on earth and Exilon 5 (the new planet). And each character mattered and had their own voice!We have Bill, a high level government official who doesn't like the natives from the new planet (called Indigene) very much because he thinks they killed his wife. It follows a few natives and a few characters back on earth. The different POV's made it easier for me to get into the story, which is usually very hard for me in this genre. BUT, sometimes it felt like there were to many. Some were necessary, I get that, but some were not and I wouldn't have minded if those didn't have a separate POV.But the story was very fascinating and really original. It's a very good example of the issues that follow when a government has ultimate control over people. And I liked discovering the origins and background from the Indigenes. Very interesting to read. And it never got really predictable. Some parts were, but most of the time it surprised me.It's obvious this is the first part from a trilogy. This book covers most of the world-building and backstory (which is a huge plus) and introduces the characters to us. While doing all that, it makes me curious for the sequel. Very well done Eliza!If you love Sci Fi books or dystopian, you will like (or even love) this one too. I recommend it to them. If this genre is really not your thing, I don't but you might as well give it a try. Who knows, maybe it surprises you and you like it anyway.
Atheistic look to the human being. The author, Julien Offray de La Mettrie, explores the theory of human flash and soul being indivisible and basically operating as a machine. Following that, all human behavior and existence is explained on the basis of physics and chemistry.A book written more than 260 years ago. Sincerely, it was one of the most difficult books to read even it's quite short. I can't say that I liked it and can't say that I didn't. It is just a lot different from all the other literature I've been reading so far. Still I'm very glad I read this book. It showed me more how people were thinking and creating different ideas and theories about human existence hundreds of years ago. Actually it is interesting that the author had so much courage to publish such a work back in those days. Nowadays religion is not as strong as it was 260 years ago and the book is very against the dogmas of church.I really like authors thought that the human is what he eats. I think it is a lot true, because what you eat defines how you feel, and how you feel most likely to define how you act what leads to what results you get in life. This entire journey is most likely to show who you are.Do you have any thoughts? Share your opinion!
Great game fun and challenge.  Fun for everyone.  Recommend it because everyone can play regardless of their age.  Get it.
they are hard to use, you need some patients to work with them, i think that for how cheap i got them they were a steal c:
everyone love them and was able to break up so many students could have a piece or two. great flavor
It can be a life changer if you remember the events leading up to the civil rights era. It was  a time of change and this book illustrates that
Bought as a gift for a little boy for Christmas. He loved it!! It works great, no problems at all.
if the gaskett and nuts and bolts came with it would been better
Cutter works great, but the  saw not so good. Overall It performed very well. I would recommend this tree pruner.
Got a Droid RazrM and an Otter Box for it. Phone fits without the protective case but with the Otter Box, no way will it fit.However, I put my camera in it and it stays on the tank no problem at 65 mph.
Recently, specifically bought this grinder as it was non-aluminum and certainly not cheap plastic. Never owned a grinder longer than a week, always broke down herbs by hand. A cheap basterd, im very picky when it comes to buying things I really dont 'need' must have great reviews or I wont touch it. I consider myself an average partaker, 6-10 sessions a day, in short order, this grinder is well worth every penny. Grinds herbs to a perfect size, pollen trap works great, easy assembly, good weight. Only flaw of this grinder... the magnet holding the top to the grinder is not very powerful, tip it sideways or upside down & the magnet will fail. Hold upright. Wash metal shavings out.
I like this case and it works great BUT i am giving this a 4 star because on my sleep/lock button it doesnt fit right. apparently the 4s is a little bigger than the 4 and i have the 4s. it will probably fit perfectly with an iphone 4
I ordered my textbook online through Amazon and it worked out great. My book arrived in a timely manner, it was in the condition described (some highlighting and writing, but nothing too bad) and I was able to save money by avoiding the book store on campus.
Game is slow to earn credits and minimum purchase is 100 gems. A little too high, but game itself is ok.
I heard about PLL from friends and I decided to read it. Now I'm reading the second book and I'm in love with it!
This is a sad, true, story ..with real characters..well written and kept objective.  Secrets surface eventually and the truth comes out..in interesting ways.
This book was just as good as the others in the series. I love it and this stupid thing requires a certain number of words....blah
This is a great addition to my fitness routine. I'm trying to lose weight for my birthday and this is giving me an awesome edge. Thanks
I'm trying to lose 20 lbs by my birthday and this is a nice addition to my workout routine. Not nearly as hungry when I'm done with my workouts.
this is good game really addictive wish had more time to play and more money to buy bingo creditsgood game for all ages
My kids love it!  and I love it, we have toys and books in there. Keeps more organized their room.Just I wish it would be a little bigger.
A good horror movie. But not a great Halloween movie. The studio had intended for Michael Myers to remain dead and start a different direction with the series in which each movie had a different plot and villain, it did not work and so they brought Mikey back in the fourth installment. But THIS, Season of The Witch, is what we got from that brief time of insanity. As I said, it's a good '80s horror movie, but a bad Halloween movie.
I believe that this book fit my needs just fine. It was very cheap and it was in good condition, as it was said to be.
It`s trendy and I has the most important thing that is to protect the IPADJust is easy to get dirty...
Despite several negative reviews, the Hornady Auto Charge works as advertised.  After reading the supplied instructions, the setup was easy, calibration simple, and once the character of individual powders was observed, I was able to drop consistent charges with maybe one overcharge per 20 cases loaded.  A level and solid surface is important to reliable operation. Overall, very satisfied with the unit.
Pros:*Paint doesn't come off.*Well molded.*nice varietyCons:*Some coloring is incorrect*Painting isn't perfect, but it's okay.*These are bootleg toys, the molds are stolen from official figures.*Some pieces come off easily, like Gigan's arm.
I ordered this for my fianc&eacute;e who has a hard time finding costumes. He is 6'6 and about 350 pounds and it fit him well.
I bought these to wear at my wedding. I love the blue birds. The boots are pointy but I don't think it is too much like some other people have said. I did order them a half size smaller like other people have posted. I have large calf muscles so it can be hard for me to wear certain shoes that are taller. These fit me without a problem and I was actually surprised! The boot is also comfortable compared to some of my other cowboy boots.
We are using it for the boy scouts project training.  It's gives good clear instructions for making good lanyards and emergency equipment.  The product was delivered on time and in good shape.
Been playing around with Dragonvale for a couple of weeks now, and it is a lot of fun. The more I play it, the more I enjoy it
It is a pretty color, but the blue wasn't as light or bright as I was hoping it would be.
I have never been a cookbook reader, but surprisingly I loved this one. Not only does it teach you to cook it teaches you how to transform your life into a healthier one. It taught me about the Standard American Diet and how it causes many diseases that people suffer from today. I loved that it taught me not only how to cook delicious meals but also how to be healthier. I was looking for a way to better myself and the foods I ate, and I can say that this book defiantly did this for me. It&#8217;s perfect for beginners, easy to read and very easy to follow the directions it provides. Best cookbook I have read in a very long time
This case is perfect for a slim gummy case effect. It fits very well on my samsung galaxy note 2. I love the feel. Its very velvety and soft feeling  my charger fits in without any hassle. The only downfall is that the case does have a slight smell. It kinda smells like plastic or rubber. Its not really strong. At first I could smell it in the air around my phone but after having on my phone for about 6 hours I only smell it when I sniff the case  other than that this is a great product. I do recommend it.
This is a very good moisturizer for dry cuticles in the winter.  I am very pleased with the results of using it everyday for three weeks.  It is so soothing after doing the dishes in bleach water. My cuticles look and feel much nicer.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy looking cuticles.
They were just what we needed, and were a good price!! The size was as expected.and fit both my boys.
Not only do I love the stories but I love writing scripts that come to life with the click of a button! I do wish there were more scenes and clothes to pick from and that I didn't have to wait 4 hours to play a new chapter. All and all I love the app. There are so many possibilities.
I felt that this was a good product. I would have given a 5 star, but I think that the finish could have been a little better.  For the money you can't beat it.
When I started reading this book, I was thinking to myself that I could finally relate to a character in these types of books because Sinai is in school like me. So I appreciated that. A lot of these books have characters that are doing all types of things, but forreal, it's hard to find regular people just doing regular things.I liked how all of the people in the story had a place and everyone came together. It just reminded me of real life. Sinai is a girl that you don't like, but you do like her. You know she's wrong for what she's doing, but you can't help but wish you could get away with having any dude you wanted like that.But onto makenzey jade as a writer. This girl is not an amateur. I read the bio in the book and it says she's young which is inspiring. For her to write that great and professional for her age is cool to me because I feel like I can do something like that too. No typos, developed characters, more than I can say about some of the more popular writers I've seen on amazon.Looking forward to what comes next. Will there be a sequel? Because, I wanna know what happens to Armand
its cheap and its protecting my vita against bumps and scuffs hear and their and it looks tight in blue.  while it wont absor shock from a significant fall itll protect against 7 yr olds man handling it. it looses a star because you cant hit the volume and power buttons unless you have like long nails or press hard on the buttons. but its no big deal really i recommend this. oh and its easy to install!
When I just want a book to take me away when I need a reprieve Debbie's books are great.  There is goodness in the heart of all of her characters.
Very enjoyable multi-generational story.  I loved the continuing story of characters I had come to know and enjoy in previous novels.
Even though some of the info did not apply to my situation I definitely did put some of that information to use and tried it out. Good to keep on hand for reviewing again. Thanks!
The chain seems a little light and flimsy . It was smaller than expected . The actual design is very good and designed very well .
Love this game ! Bought this one so I don't lose any pieces . Fun family game . Just be careful not to stain or fold the cards because they are somewhat flimsy .
A very warm and soft blanket for layering . Not pretty but cozy and more than useful. Can easily useas top and bottom sheeting on cold nights.
This product arrived within a week to Trinidad.Day and night vision is perfect would recommended this product to anyone best value for money
This work order is good, but I actually like the older one best of all,  just hard to find them!
These gloves are a perfect color and size.  They will keep my granddaughter warm during our Ohio winter.  I like how high up her arms they go.
The necklace itself is pretty, but the stone had fallen out when I got it and had to fix it. Otherwise, it's nice.
The book contains a lot of helpful information. Very easy to read. Contains sites that will be of great help when planning a trip to Paris.
Cute game, you can tell its an older version but its still disney so i guess that makes up for it.
Nice set of fiingerpaints. They dont seem full, kind of like air in a bag of chips. But the paint is thick and good for fingerpainting
I love taylor swift annd while her first CD is her best one, this one didnt dissapoint. I would buy it again.
I like this eye shadow palette because the colors are great for everyday wear. Some of the shades have a bit of shimmer while others are more matte.great product!!!!! I love the colors and the quality!!! Great seller too. So fast and nice. I recommended to all!The only downside is the brush, it's too small and hard.
The only thing is i bought mine used and has a spot that won't shut all the way but still nice.
Works well with our cabinets.  Matches our other handles and are sturdy.  Good price, will order from this manufacturer again.
Bought a couple to keep on hand.  Good price and convenient to order.  I will order again when I am almost out.
This is just right for a singer sewing machine starter kit.  The bobbins that come with the set do not fit a brother sewing machine.
I ordered 4 packs of this thread as it came in cotton,  There are two different sets of colors and the both are great.
i liked this phone because of all the useful programs like excel and powerpoint for business purposes. Also, it has the game bubbles!
Just so nice to hear two great artists still alive and kicking. They really make each other better although they are perfect songwriters by them self.
Since I ordered it for only $25, I'm not too concerned about the small issues with it. The cups run a size small, so I ordered a 28GG, which is one size up from what I wear in the Lucy and Marcie. It's the correct size, and it fits fairly well. However, I dislike how thick and stiff the padding is. It's similar to the Freya Deco, padding wise. It also gives a slightly more wide front profile than the Lucy or Marcie. It makes my boobs appear a bit larger than they are, which isn't something that I look for in a bra. Despite the little problems with it, it's a nice basic and will be great for spring and summer .
Great book, fast moving plot. maybe too many characters. 4 story lines at one time. great ending. Kat Donovan was a tough cookie
Most interesting read and theory. I have been following similar diet and it was great to compare. Reccommend to anyone who wants to stay healthy but of course talk to your doctor first.
I love this watch, even though it is bigger than I thought it would be.  I have had it for a couple months now and the gold tone is starting wear off already, which is why I didn't give 5 stars.
Some chapters could be funnier, but on the whole, this is a lol book!  Easy, quick read, a chapter at a time if you only have a minute.
Kinda cheap looking in person the lace is slowly but surely coming apart by it being stringy but quick buck to make your phone look cute
it fits good and looks good the covers they send do not fit good they bubble
It's a great case and well worth the value comparable to the more expensive cases.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
This was  great way to end the series. Finished everything up but let some space just in case another one gets written.
I will admit I had trouble getting through this one because  of how strongly I was pulled into the storyline. There is heartache and happiness and sadness and moments of OMG...and that's just in the first few chapters!
All 3 books in one it even better..didnt have to wait - just read right through. It moves fast, but doesnt lack the emotional ups and downs and connection to the characters!!!
My daughter appreciated updating her old, stretched-out Reefs.  This pair of size 7 fit her snuggly.  Now she just has to break them in.
Like it a lot and a beautiful design and excellent raw and startling in use but smallThank you very much
Its captivating to read and worthy to share... the simplicity of the descriptions provided makes the reading a memorable experience indeed.
I like the bag; it's neat and big . However it is a bit hard to scroll when it's heavy
I've got the new update for my android phone with the daily free spins but not for the kindle... Hmmm.... :(
Fun game . Works well. Well made . It does not go around  or get knocked down. It lights when you hit it
Its a pretty good read it helped me in a couple ways.  I dont think it will save my marriage but its helped me move on with peace in my heart, for that i am thankful.
Love this feeder. Heavy duty & capacity. Best feature is the large varmint guard. Definitely use a small lock or securing device on the battery housing latch. I gave 4 stars because several bolts were missing. Check contents b4 beginning.
Comfortable boots. Pants must be worn over the boots, as the zipper is difficult to get up with added bulk. I wore them twice in the snow, and each time my feet were warm and dry.
bought this as a gift and recived it really quick but was defected the quality of pic looked like an x ray picture sent it back had to pay $9.50 extra out of pocket not happy..Recived the 2nd one in 2-3days very pleased my brother loves it great product
Pretty cone maker. Does a good job of shaving ice. Kids love it.Monitoring its longevity. Wondering whether the blades can be sharpened.
When I started reading this book, I got so into it,  that I needed more to read. The more I read into the story and how the character came to be, it just made it more interesting. Can wait to read on and see what happens to the rest of the main characters. Must read...
I really enjoyed reading this book. It was so real of what goes on now a days and the reality of life when you choose to go down the wrong path only to realize you can do right if you want it or not. I hope there is another part to this story because it seems like there could be a second book. Again really enjoyed the book and I would recommend this book to others if they like romance, hardship, and just a dose of real life crap that happends in the world.
Gotta start from book 1 to really enjoy the series of this book. Really strong females and males but I think the females rock in the series while the males are hot.
This is a very good description of a slow and steady capital growth strategy using options.  The book is clear and concise and does not require much additional information to implement aside from a good basic understanding of how options work.  I recommend it.
good purchase, this knife used with lansky system is razor sharp. would reccommend for most outdoors uses. have not put it through the paces yet.
I didn't know if I would like the game or not.tried it and I have to say I'm pretty impressed with the app. S1 Alfheim: 17nua3g5
I had to be very carefull installing it but every thing went well I am very happy with the product. and give this one thumbs up.
Once key board is set it should stay there, Hands free speaker is  not Loud enough but still a great phone
works good.  I helped my daughters older dryer get back to its original operating temperature.  Would buy again if needed.
This tiny radio works surprisingly good for size.  Using in garage - signals great through walls and once installed, never have to mess with settings.  Very stable.
Well crafted read!  Intregueing plot elements written with a few twists and turns that keeps the reader involved right to the end.
This product overall is a good purchase, but like all things have pros and cons.The first thing I noticed when I received the used Galaxy Player I bought was that it was 100% out of battery. This was easily fixable when I plugged in the charge to recharge it but it was a little disappointing. When I turned it on later it worked well and started to explore. I was happy at the empty music library, fresh cleared screens ready for apps to be downloaded, and storage galore! However, all of the last user's personal pictures and videos were still on the device. For the sake of their privacy I deleted everything as soon as I could. Other than that, I can say that I am very content with the Samsung 4-Inch Galaxy Player! My weeks of researching a good media player paid off.Pros and Cons:Pro:- A camera on the front and back- Plenty of room for music and downloads- Access to many free apps- Easily fits in pockets or bags- You can plug in headphones to listen to music individually or use the speakers on the back of the Galaxy Player to share with others-  As I've heard previously stated, it's like a smart phone without the phoneCons:- The screen occasionally dims on its own even when being actively used- Sometimes the music is choppy when there are other applications open at the same time- The background of my screen has blacked out once and I had to re-start the Galaxy Player to reset itHonestly, I would like to say that the positive outweighs the bad. I bought a used one so perhaps someone who bought theirs new would have a little better luck. Overall, this is worth its bargain and I would recommend it to someone looking for a new media player.
I got this watch box obviously because it was cheaper, and it still had great reviews!Pros:-Sturdy-Fits my 47mm watch-Very nice lookingCons:-It looks really nice, the top is not glass like it says but it is a nice plastic that looks like glass.-My box did not come with a lock and key, which I did not expect, but I really wasn't going to use it anyways.
This game is a developing BETA preparing for final launch very soon. But that does not affect the quality!Pros:No Super Computer Needed: I play this game on an I3 with 2g Ram. The settings i have are set to Low, there is an ULTRA low.Bring a friend, this game is pure co-opThis game has a never ending war between hundreds of players at once, in land, air, armor, and mechanical beings on maps that are legitimately 250+ square miles across.There is no pressure to buy, you can obtain many things relatively quick.Amazing community: Concerned players, and teamwork. The players i have played with will often heal me, repair me, revive me, work with me, give me ammo, wait for me to get in vehicles, and have taught me tips and tricks with respect. They realize that assisting your comrade is better for you both in the long run, you want as many experienced and alive players with you when the big battles ensue.Men and Women come together in respect: TRUE respect, be you woman or man, the players (at least on Mathersson server) have treated me and mine with respect, just because she is a girl nobody has changed the way they treat her drastically, only for the better.NO WHINING LITTLE CHILDREN: You read that right, i have yet to run into a child in the game who whines or acts like the console community children. Even the kiddies who play the game know that respect is key to win.CONS:Crashes, a few bugs, and weapon \nerfing\. In Beta stage the game crashes at least once a day, which up to now has not caused any damage to my account other than the vehicle i was in dissapearing. Bugs are present in more than one place. Weapons for many factions have been altered to attempt to balance the game but there is still a big margain to balance.Go big or go home: Planetside 2 can be played casually but the biggest battles last 2+ hours.Need a Fast Internet connection: At least 1 mbps.Game requires patience: Not for the 360 quick scope... the battles are such large scales they take time and strategy to accomplish. If you do not stick with your comrades you will get nowhere.
REALLY HELPS TO GET DOWN CONSUME, MY CAR 38 KM PER GALON WITH THIS GOES IN 48 KM PER GALON
Beautiful and great quality Bassinet! I would have chosen 5 stars, but it was not the easiest thing to put together. I would definetly recommend this product!
good.but I think A bit expensiveVery warmVery niceVery softI hope If the price was lower
good. but I think A bit expensiveI hope If the price was lowervery warm..very softI'm Generally satisfied
Set up was very easy, but the instructions didn't mention that there is a tiny switch that controls the fountain. When I first set it up I thought it wasn't working because there was barely any flow from the top. Only after I rewashed all parts did I discover the tiny 3-position switch.
I love thus game and play it often, but it is not fair at all. It gives you way to long to answer the puzzle. It's like a minute for each player. If I can't get in soon I just press &#34;give up&#34; because I think it's a cheat to take so much time.
My son plays this game all the time. He loves Umizoomi. He has all the badges and trophies for the first two levels on here, but the others will not unlock. I don't know how many times you have to replay the same two games, but now he's had it for months and is sick of it because it's just to long to wait for something else to happen.
All around nice case. Looks good and feels good. Very nice cfm fan on the front and bright blue led was a good touch. Only bad thing was that it came with the power button damaged. No worries as that was an easy fix.
These look really cute and are fairly sturdy. My 8 year old daughter was very happy with them. The Disney Princess packaging was a little off-putting as she thinks she's too old for all that!
This isfun game for all ages. I enjoy the cute accessories you can buy for the characters. I also like that it tells you if you have a qualifying word
The rating I gave this book suits it for me, since it had great detail throughout the book. The book was very adventurous and very interesting.
Great game for passing time. Graphics are pretty good too. I enjoy the contract hunts and the weapon upgraded. Good stuff
All my previous headsets would fall off my ears since they're soo small.  These fit nicely and are comfortable.I feel that the quality of the sound was better on previous companies that I had.
good story to help kid understand more about anxiety and how to control it. I give it 4 star because it is a bit wordy that kids can lose interest halfway through the book...
Muy bonita novela.  Triste y conmovedora. Deja una bonita ense&ntilde;anza y tr gu&iacute;a a apreciar lo bueno y lo bonito de la vida.
This game is fun but the problem is that it kind of skips as you play so it is hard to get a high score.
Very good same as I got before
Good keyboard connects to any Bluetooth device I have.  I use it for my iPad, iPhone, play station 3 and laptop and it does what I need it to do. The only thing is I have to sync with the device I want to use each time. Unless I keep it on that device all the time.
it fits too large for a large size. It is much larger than ExOfficio L. I returned it, anyway the fabric is soft and the cut is elegant.
Great colours, soft fabric and fits great. I like how it feels on the skin, looks perfect below a blazer.
It is somewhat a bit large. I am a Medium and it is a bit large, it fits down my hip. I am 1,59m tall. The fabric is soft and fresh though. I love it
the story is quite irony. however, I cannot understand some of the expression. the English is quite old caused me confuse sometime.
Tuff to site in but once you do its great. Hopefully it will keep me from having to use my weapon. Only a fool would not respect the red dot if they break in my house.
Was for a good price. Never finished it, not sure why now that I think about it. Anyway, I would consider buying this item.
This product is good, has a lot of styling options and works very well. However you have to charge after every use because the charge doesn't last long, but other than that it is a good product especially for the price.
The product itself is good. The capsules are well made.  My doctor asked me to get it. This is the 2nd month that I have been taking it.  I don't see a difference in how I feel but the doctor said to give it another month.
This game is O.K. starting out but after you complete all single player missions (about a week's worth of frequent play) you run out of game play. At level 50 you have completed all missions and there are no more. To build a really BIG card takes about 1 million coins, and without any world's to play the only way to get coins is the market. Even so it's fun if you like in depth card development. There is literally an infinite combination of builds.  Doesn't play so well on I-pad 1. Overall fun game, I'm still playing about 4 hours a week after 3 months. And you don't have to spend real money to build really strong cards, just a lot of time. 4 stars. And developers, please open up new worlds, or add harder difficulty to existing ones please.
I really went through this off brand coffee.  I found it in the corner of the site,give it a try!It is a great value,and will get it in the future.
I received this coffee for the first time.  Has a good full flavor and peps you up! I will but on some Raggie and jam on it!
I choose this book of the cover but once I started reading I couldn't put it down it turned out to be a true love story the best love was that of family
this book was a page tuner didn't expect this ending I can't wait to read about the stories to come about the Barboza brothers and the women they love. Makes us full figured women feel good knowing there are men out there who desire us
Love this game it is stimulates your brain makes you really notice these everyday things you see and how they are related
Works great for the small room we wanted to move some air around,  Directions are simple, Not sure why several complain about putting it together.
Item is what was expected. Arrived in good condition, minor loose threads, nothing major. Will go great with my costume.
I tried this product to see if it would help as a sexual stimulant and have had positive results..I've been taking this product for about 30 days and will continue to do so..I would recommend this product to men of the 50+ age group....
I have read almost all of the kontra's menagerie series and this is by far one of my favorites. However I am a sucker for a strong dominant personality. I this case it's not the shifter.
Product is as described and fits properly.  Just make sure you take the time to look at the size chart so you get the correct size.  There are no pockets for your hands as you might expect on a Levis denim jacket.  But for the price, the denim jacket looks good and quality seems to be decent as well.  I would recommend this if you can do without pockets for your hands.  The 2 chest pockets are real pockets however.  For this price, it's a good purchase.
This case is very thin and adds no bulk to your nexus 4, it does a good job raising the sides of the case so the screen doesn't touch the floor flat.One thing I wish they would add is the top and bottom of the case. If the case covered all around the nexus that would add protection which I would definetly buyvagain if improved
only real con i can think of would be it not having removable/replaceable metal shield things on the back where your video card is placed.
Very good book. Enjoyed reading it and recommend  it to anyone as a good read. The Maori people were fascinating.
Very good book.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone as a good read. I will read some more of judy Walter's books.
This microwave is smaller than our previous 1100 watt and that is a plus because the inside room is still more than adequate. I don't mind that the light doesn't come on until it's cooking even though that was a negative for some purchasers. I don't think it's any louder than our other one...now I'm waiting to see if it's going to last LONGER than the old one! I certainly hope so...my very first microwave was a very large Sharp Carousel that we used for over 20 years! The second Sharp Carousel lasted only 5 years! I certainly hope the Panasonic does better than that! So far...so good!I forgot to say why the four star rating...it's because the ease of programming certain foods is not as easy as it was with our previous microwave. I am very much computer/programming literate but this one seems to be a little more unnecessarily complicated...just sayin'!!
Great for winter dry skin and for the hair. I have even seen some new hair growth along my hairline!
This pitcher is of good quality. Only flaw is, that handle gets hot when frothing milk. I would of preferred a rubber handle to protect from scalding my hand.
It is very rewarding to listen to a piece of music that is not &#34;elevator music&#34; and very enjoyable.  Best results:  Listen in the early part of the day.  The effect is &#34;up and at em&#34; with a smile.
New age at it's best  ever day listening.  Best used for relaxation.  It would appear to be an early work.
An idea entered into your tablet will instantly be in your Kindle, desk PC etc.  I find this to be a very handy tool.  A good example is a picture taken away from home will be on your PC ready to print.
The set of Alpha Tales have fulfilled the purpose for which I bought them.  I was perhaps expecting something a little simpler in the theme of the stories for little ones to understand. Some of the themes I would think are more for around five year olds where as the children I care for are usually two or three year olds sometimes four years old. It would have been helpful to have an age recommendation on them.
I love it....but by the time I finish this game I will have paid 500.00 or more just to play. Why weren't we offered first bid on the stocks? The creators are crafty. Love the game but I will never finish.TOO MUCH MONEY!!!!!
I have used the NB811 shoes for years. it is now discontinued. I read the review of the new 812, and decided to change.Since I use a custom insert  in both the left and right shoe, i took a gamble that this would work. The stride is more lively then the 811, the support is as good, but my feet feel warmer( i live in Florida) when I am just sitting around. They are Not made in the U.S.A. I think once I get used to the difference that they will be fine for the live of the shoe.
It works perfect. 100% compatible with my Dell Inspiron 1525 notebook.I'll recommend it.duration of 4 hours.great product!
love it but it isnt a boot its like a socks shaped like a boot .. but its a good one with the band
Lights up the room with crazy colours. I bought it as a night light for my daughter. Has 8 different lighting options which is cool. But the lights change really fast which is kind of defeating the purpose of a night light. I thought the colour would change slower to be more soothing so it could help her fall asleep not be like a night club with flashing lights. It is very bright. Doesn't matter though she loves it and thinks its pretty. Its just a plus for me because saves me on hydro so she doesn't have her lamps on all night. It also come with batteries. Delivery arrived on time as well.
This shirt looks awesome. Love the graphics. Arrived on time and fits great. Would recommend to any one who likes graphic tees.
The makers of these games always force adds for other games and reviews down your throat. It's an interesting game but they should give player more room to play without the pushing.
Great book!!Couldn't put it down once I started reading it!What a great love story! Shows you can over come a lot when you have that kind of attraction and love!
Works and makes noise.
Good boots but has lug sole and holds dirt...made for boat work, I guess.
This very basic travel bag is much larger than I expected. It comes with a flat bottom insert that makes it easy for packing. Shoes can go in either of zippered sides. I put my phone charger in the front zippered compartment. I believe that it is not airline quality but for road trips it is perfect. It could be more attractive but for the price you can't beat it.
Easy application, and if you screw up you can still apply w/o bubbles. The only draw back is the protector does scratch easy.
projector was okay if its all the right spots the only thing that sucks is that the marks it leaves after you applied a screen protector to your phone. it's not clear you can still see the marks and indents of where you try to put it on
I enjoyed this book, i literally couldn't put it down. However, it reminds me of a generic brand of 50 shades of grey. It is still a good book and i recommend it to anyone who liked 50 shades of grey.
My daughter has thick hair and I hate the blowdrying process but with rhis product I don't mund and neither does she
The quality of this helmet is awesome, it is well over a $100 helmet at a $50 price. Visor doesn't fog up much or anything, fits well and is comfortable on long rides. Going to buy a tinted visor to go with it.
Accurate, precise, and great weather alerts. Don't need to watchr listen to weather reports any more. Would like to see times and temps listed for a two or three day period instead of scrolling.
Love this app. Sometimes the answer is obscure but overall it's a fun game. When you identify the bands, remember what they looked like then, not now.
nice bands, we had purchased a few others but these are very comfortable to wear and nice looking also. We got one for the wife and one for the husband. These are very nice rings
I really like this cardigan. Even though its thinner fabric than I expected its warm enough and comfortable. The litte pockets are cute and convienent.
This item has good performance, but if you want more (Bluetooh) buy version mk808B.Wifi work good, signal HDMI has a problem with resolution too big, but update or change the firmware fix it.
The sizes definitely run a bit small. I ordered my normal size small and it fits, but it's definitely tight! I won't return it and I love the shirt! I wear it often :-) but if I ordered another, I will order the next size up.
First unit sounded like an old boat dock, dissembled a few times and even called customer service for help. love it however needed to return one.
It does \Work\ as stated, and I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the sling swivel kit needs to come with not just the long wood/plastic screw base mount, but needs to also include a shorter base mount wood/plastic screw.  I had to customize/shorten the long base screw that's used for wood/plastic stocks, so it would fit my pistol grip folding stock, but the sling kit mounts do give a strong anchor point for your sling , and they look good when installed, and it functions great with my condor brand name sling.JM
If you're looking for a small live animal trap that works, then this is the trap for You !  But I would have liked for the trap to have been manufactured using heavier materials, but as for the function of this small trap, it works \Great\.
Nice Sling, it seems to be heavy duty, and I would have given it 5 stars, but it may be to adjustable, meaning I don't know if the heavy duty plastic disconnect buckles are really a &#34;Plus&#34;, but again the sling does appear to be made of heavy duty materials.JM
Well packaged and arrived on time. While not my favorite Avengers episodes, the Cathy Gale series was necessary to complete my collection. It also helps to watch the progression the series made and confirm the pivotal role Macnee made his own so elegantly.
I love love love this case, the rubber corners make for a very protected phone. The only downfall is the rubber gets a little loose sometimes and it gets hard to be able to click your buttons. Its an easy fix though. This case is awesome, definitely will be buying another in a different color
Its great but too slow like old people. If the game wasnt all lagged out I might of enjoyed it. Its hard to purchase any coins when it lagged out on me.
Well written, tells the story, and provides the markers for one involved in a similar situation as the author. Highly recommend this book to anyone who is having similar relationship problems as well as their family members.
Excellent read! Such a feel good story. Nice to be able to read a good clean love story!! Heartwarming! :)
I enjoyed the book and recommend it to everyone that wonders what life could be like if this country could be like at the end.
This was a good read and left  me with plenty to think about. I enjoyed the book but felt the sadistic treatment of the orphans and future pilot was not consistent with the story.  It seemed to be a little too  extreme and unbelievable.
Entertaining book. I enjoyed the twist and turns of the story but sometimes had a hard time keeping up with who's who. The book had so many characters in it that it made it hard to keep up with them.
We loved the movie.  However, the sequel after the movie &#34;stuck&#34; so had to turn off.  We have not viewed all the other movies yet. Thanks.
So many good suggestions and the book is well organized. Have gotten some excellent skin care advice and feel as if my skin IS looking better. Like the fact that the suggestions don't cost an arm and a leg but really target what is useful. Plus great diet and exercise suggestions! Respect Dr. Oz and am thankful to all the women who worked hard to bring this book about. Thank YOU!
So here's a REAL  REVIEW. This app does work, there are alot of people complaining about a good app.The Good:  So basically they've got Over a Dozen of there popular shows like Scandal, neighbors, Once. Plus several News programs, both Today shows, 20/20, what would U do &amp; More. For a total of 25 or 30 different programs, maybe more. There are the latest 5 episodes of each able to use watched.The shows clarity depends on your internet speed and your tablet or computer. So the people complaining about it are just cheap. It will stream as good as Netflix or YouTube.Commercials:  Yes you have to watch them but there is one at the beginning of the show and Maybe 2or3 throughout.  You pay $30-100 for cable and have to watch several commercials every 7 mins. This is FREE and there are like 20 less commercials to watch per show. When I was watching nightline there was only one at the beginning.THE  BAD:  I've watched five shows with no problem but one time it did freeze on me. Another time there was a short delay at the very first show I watched there was a 15 or 20 second delay before it startedMY CONCLUSION:  Great Free App , I would pay for it knowing it's this good. I would highly recommend getting. I have a kindle fire HD 7&quot;  I can't guarantee it works with all devices but it sure is worth a shot.  I have gotten other &quot;so-called&quot; tv apps and they didn't let you watch anything. This is different,  download it and you will be happy you did. Then like my comment for giving you such a great suggestion
They are really cool looking some are duplicates  great for the price really wanted the dark blue and black ones  but got mostly pink  which im not too fond of  but for the price its a good deal
Excelllent and very fast. I like the style and color of mouse. Its smart but you need to care much.
I really liked this film . It is not one I had seen  before. Very quirky. But a nice old film.
besides the pickups and deans guitars tendency to have fret noise on very few frets, this guitar rocks, great action, awesome looking
I enjoyed this game, but would have liked to have more interaction with the ghosts.  They were mostly just a shadow and not having much impact on game play.
Recently I was interested in playing a few classic Nintendo games and I saw this, andI love the look of the console itself, eeminds me of the famicom. Anyway, let me get into some pros and cons of the console.Pros:-Compatible wih almost the entire NES library (only a dozen or so games dont work)-Very cheap in comparison to the original NES & NES toploader-It looks good, not as good as an original Nintendo, but still good-The 2 packaged in controllers are nice, they aren't pretty, but they feel decent and have good features-You can use original NES controllers, because it has the standard NES port-The console feels sturdy, but is very lightCons:-The plastic feels cheap, but it's not horrible by any means-A few games aren't compatible-The console is really light and that bothers me, I like hefty videogame consoles, you feel like youre buying something with more qualityOverall the console is a nice alternative to buying a Nintendo. You'll save a bit of cash and if you get some official Nintendo controllers or some nice 3rd party controllers then the experience shouldn't be any different from playing an original NES.4/5
the main reason i chose this is for the color and the kickstand!it's asking me for more words and i'm done!
So far so good.  The Preface is detailed and informative.  I carry this book in my Kindle which makes very easy to read.  I hope to receive info on sermons and how to prepare them, as well as delivery.
An older movie that was good.  The musical score is also good.  And it tells a part of history that gets ignored.  We need to learn from that history so we don't repeat it!
I've been a big fan of the codeword puzzles in crossword books. This version takes all the drudgework  out of guessing letters, filling each blank and erasing them all if they're incorrect. My only criticism of the game is that it is possibly too easy to complete, since you can check your answers at any point in the game. I'm going to purchase the unlimited version as soon as my free games run out!
this is really good and fun blah blah blah im just doing this for the hints but it really is fun you ahould try it but im just going to ramble because i have to use twenty words minumum so dog cat cute fun cool expensive lalala is it twenty words yet this is ridicoilous and i tottaly spellt that word wrong
Look great, a little wobble since it's difficult to set the tires evenly. Great for off road. Changing tires will take some time but much easier than gluing.
I ordered these, expecting them to be cheap, but they were very nice. The color was identical to my Leg Avenue Classic Cinderella costume, and they are very smooth & sturdy. It really added that extra touch to my costume, and I'm really glad I got them. Now, however, I have relatively long/narrow fingers, so it may not fit as well if you think you have thicker fingers. But for me, they fit like a glove *ba dum tsss*.
this game is pretty cool because it is realistic all the other dress ups have to do with animated figures
I like it, I felt the connection between the characters so much I end up reading the following book after that. This series could be a hallmark love story in their valentine episode.
I bought this after my four year old broke this piece the second piece in my six year old refrigerator. It was a good fit. It seemed a little expensive for a plastic replacement part but it got the job done.
Looks nice and does a good job of protecting the tablet when I carry it around in a bag or rest it down on a hard surface. Quality seems good so far.The only issue I have is that the tablet does not fit snugly in the case so when I hold it upright in landscape orientation it slides down in the case and the bottom edge of the screen becomes blocked by the case which means the back, home symbols etc. are partially blocked and hard to press. Would suggest Velcro to secure the tab at the bottom as it slides out under the weight of the tablet allowing the tablet to move down.
This boot fits GREAT and it's EASY to pull on.  The top (leg) section though is a bit big (swimmy). Wish that part would be more snug. The look is classy for office or casual weekend dress up.  Very sturdy too.
This is a great unit.  I only wish it had been about 5 inches taller.  Although nothing replaces a &#34;real&#34; fire.  This is pretty cute and the heat can be well controlled with the remote. The wood color is beautiful (as pictured).
Quality is good and it looks exactly like the original except it fits a little loose. The clips are a bit different but not a big issue. It does come with the bulbs and sockets and the price is cheaper than a recycled part at a junk yard if you can even find one.
Another great book in the Bound Hearts series by Lora Leigh!I would highly recommend this book and the complete series!
Excellent it works just like is meant to work great price good product!  Just make sure to install ezcast to device
I bought these to go with my Bluetooth headset in case the original one broke. Fortunately I haven't had to use them yet but it's good to have them on hand.
Be VERY careful when buying this product. Please read the rest of my view if you&#8217;re considering of switching to a 4.A little about myself to understand clearly:I've been playing since 5th grade. Ive been section leader and 1st chair for 2 years. Currently a senior in high school.Review:These reeds are EXTREMELY hard to play at first. After my first practice, I was physically exhausted from trying to play. At the time, I could not even play a low D. Gradually I have been adapting to the reeds but they take A LOT of air.Pro:They play a lot louder. (It's probably because it's forcing you to push more air than usual, but still)Articulation is easierDynamics are easierCons:Physically exhausting the first couple of timesRequires a lot more air (This is actually a pro)Very hard to play lower notes (Still working on anything below a low C)A little more difficult to play quieter (Not very noticeable)Conclusion:Don't buy these reeds. If you&#8217;re still in high school, buy a 3 or maybe a 3.5 if you&#8217;re really wanting to switch. I love Vandoren but #4 reeds are a little overkill.
I loved this book. It was one of those books that you love to jump into and get lost into the fantasy that awaits the characters. From start to finish there is always something going on that catches your attention and makes you want to read more. At times I found it hard to open my kindle and find times to read so it was hard to get into the book again because  I was frequently having to stop. I think this is.  Great read for any fantasy reader.
High quality, box just a little scratched from shipping. Great product though I really like them good color, wonderful. Id get them and I already did haha. I don't really know what else to say I just need more words for it to submit.
I have been taking this for a month now and combined with the Garcinia Cambogia and Raspberry Ketones supplements this seems to have boosted my energy levels and I'm feeling generally more active.
I bought this book for my son who welcomed a new Mastiff puppy in Sept. When I flipped through it it looked quite good.
Essential for anyone interested in theology related to the old and new Testament. Very deep and a bit meandering at times, but still recommended.
It's a good choice for hot beverages but not too safe because the movements it spills out if its full
they are good and nice and convenient but they don't seal well enough the paint will thicken and start to dry out after a while
I am 59 and primary cook \certified foodie\ in the family. My wife has asked me to prepare special diets to keep weight down for both of us at times. My experience has been that while we have kept weight off with South Beach, long term shopping requirements were too intense and unsustainable. The meals were also not satisfying for the level of cooking I enjoy. We would go on South Beach and lose weight, go back to normal schedule and put weight back on and repeat process. The cauliflower \fake mashed potatoes\ grew pretty weary as a Julia old school French cooking fan. Forget the no wine phase. Great glass of wine after a long day is well deserved. There are several pretty good meals on Doctor Oz such as the tofu tacos and shredded chicken BBQ that really surprised me and are normal weekday new additions worth a Google.About six months ago I started many of the recommendations mentioned in the book before even reading it. I get to keep my passion for trying new dishes with best fresh ingredients but just limited portions. In the past I would eat whatever portion the host or host put on the plate so as not to offend. Now I always tell the host or hostess I am on portion control but want to sample every thing they have prepared.Bottom line, I would rather have a small serving of great food than my previous life where the pounds would add up with no portion control. Add a reasonable level of exercise and I have dropped weight from 180 to 160 in six months and still look forward to dinner!A nice add on to this book might be the best dishes author has tasted in his travels. If I am going to have less, I want the best.
upgraded the hard drive in my laptop with this ssd, its like lightning speed now. great buy at 300 bucks on black friday
Really interesting read, very easy to relate to and gives some perspective on starting a business from a rookie point of view.
This show is entertaining and has an interesting storyline. The dancers are amazing and so fun to watch. Great show!
I absolutely love my kindle fire HDX. It's quality is amazing, the screen resolution is great. The features are perfect. The only downside is that it doesn't have a huge selection of apps. But other than that it's perfect. The movies look amazing on this, and the speakers sound great. For the price, this is a steal. It's also super fast.
Jay and Sam meet in a remote part of Montana but Sam's past takes them on a whirlwind, circuitous trip to Los Angeles... Where it does not live up to its' nickname... The City of Angels!  Nude sketches by a hippie artist, an inept FBI, bouncers and hit men guarantee a wild ride for two men holding onto each other while hoping for love.
It always seems that people take awhile to figure out what they need, whether it is their job, their friends or their special person.  Just don't give up until you find the perfect one for you, whomever they are.  Everyone has their own special 'perfectness!'
Ok well this book has a great hook and really drags u into it so it's really great up until the end which isn't very good. But up until the end the book shows what true \equality\ and \conformity\ is.
Simple and to the point, just reinforces the basics that we all learnt but usually forget to put into practice.
I dont have negative stuff to say bout this cause i like it :) i ordered it together with the in sax mini8..
I had a flatware set that I picked up from Big Lots.  They started rusting after 6 months.  After a month of research, I bought this set.  They have a good weight to them and the style feels good when in use.  I especially like the beveled tip on the handle.  I fits in such a way in your hand as to make it feel secure.  The knifes cut great!! My only complaint is I wish there were more spoons in this set.
Man these things are bulky!!  They sound VERY good. The controls are nice.  The mic works without fiddling with it.  I have found that they can last for 5-6 hours of non stop use.  The charging cable plugs in the back so you can still use when plugged in.  Works on my PS3 as well as my computer.  I think they were worth the purchase.
No matter what I did, I could not get this cover to go on correctly.  Luckily there is 3 in a pack!  That way I could mess up 3 times in a row.  This is a good deal, even though I failed.
Wind 'N Go Portable Lantern/RadioThis was a Christmas gift and person thought it was really good and great item for their use
Helpful information; more than I could absorb as a beginner in podcasting. I appreciated the information on equipment as well as the techniques involved, and the use of RSS.
This is a good solid program which was helpful in learning to use Adobe Presenter 9; after the program, I was able to prepare online classes in SCORM format without difficulty.
I sometimes show videos in a variety of classroom settings.  I need amplification in different sized classrooms, one of which will seat over 90 students.  This set of microphones is small enough to travel on my cart, simple enough to set up quickly, and powerful enough to fill the room with adequate amplification
I have read the major books by Don Richardson, and appreciate his ministry and message.  He emphasizes the possibility of a cultural equivalent to present the gospel, and thanks to his emphasis, I was able to find one during my time in Suriname.  However, as opposed to Ee Tauw!, he presents the people as they are in the raw, which makes it difficult to show in mixed audience with so many bare breasted women.  I realize that this is reality, but makes it difficult for me to use the film.
Good tasting gum but does get sticky after a while of chewing, you could probably hold something together with it.
Got for my mother, at first it was fitting loose but after wearing it in she likes them, No wires and comfort strap works. Great price from Amazon for these as well. She says getting harder to find good bras in local stores anymore.
It's nice it comes with compound and strips, also the ergonomic plastic handles work well. My only complaint is i wish the diameter of the spikes were smaller in size, other than that it will work.
I like it because according to my sister my nephew loves chewing on it! I guess it works well on him with teething as well as brushing.
Good plastic container for the price to put oil in after each change. holds 12 quarts. Afterwards you can take to a recycle center and pour it out. Only thing is I wish it had a better made lid with better seal because eventually it will wear out.
Got for my nephew who likes transformers, he liked the somewhat confusing opening and manipulation of getting each picture to show. So far they haven't torn but are made of heavy paper design, same as we had as a kid type stuff. overall price was good.
This is a good bath brush. Soft bristles and once piece wood design with lanyard. Just a sort of soft to medium scrubbing feel from bristles and once piece wood so not to fall apart or decay as fast.
was nice, gave it to my mom for her bedroom. I think overall quality of wood and finish was nice
I use this with my PC for TV using Charter provided cable box &#34;Motorola digital&#34; box not HD. Using blaster on front of cable box IR i can use my windows media player remote only. There is some lag from box but that is normal even with the charter remote to the box. lol  Works great! Windows 7 with Hauppauge tuner.
Seems to have really good battery life and the ability to go side to side of back with buttons makes things quicker at work. Also the software that comes with it makes the mouse a robust little operator.
Worked very good this past summer at keeping mosquitoes off of us here in the South. Was new to Picaridin but seems more safer than DEET. Smells not too bad and had that skin so soft softly feeling.
Portable and multi functional at a low price. Makes great gift or stocking stuffer for christmas. Also can fit on a keychain
Dad loves to collect wheat pennies and each year I buy some just to let him search through them, this is his favorite thing to do. I think he is hoping to find a 1909vdb S LOL
Accumulair makes some pretty good filters, we use the Merv 6 to Merv 8 ratings and buy as a pack. It will last us a year and seems to filter really well without straining the system. forget buying 3M ones these are the ones you need.
Once put together and all it's a neat little mesmerizing little science gift to watch. Made of plastic and metal with magnets.
Helps my mother get up and off toilet and she is on the heavy side. It is somewhat flimsy in some ways as the front doesn't mount down but it allows for moving up to clean! overall i found it good. I did however have to modify the seat as the plastic tabs on back stuck out further than probably most would.
Strips work well and the device it goes with works well. I use this brand as either main use or backup to other devices for glucose.
Works dang good, has light at end for seeing yourself to the tire stem. Has backlit screen showing tire pressues in lbs or other increments. Cuts off after a minute or so or you can hold down and turn off. So far has been better than most Accuair gauges.
Haven't had time to fully try this out long enough but so far it doesn't bother my allergies and seems good for now. Will try to update this again later at its Anti Fungal properties.
Good trimmer for around $10 or so, the battery that came with it was dead so i put in a good sanyo oneloop rechargeable battery and this thing is good for trimming hair. Ever see the info commercial of similar product for over $20 this beats that way by far. Again Wahl gives you the bang for you buck.
Works good for me, no irritation and smells good for two days even without a shower. Overall the dry solid is best choice as the clear gels are messy and seem to not last as good. Appears to have the same amount of metal as others in it but this brand works best out of using right guard, mens dove, axe, mitchum, or old spice.
Detail is superb for something made of resin. Its head and fangs are nicely done and overall height works. Going to make a good gift.
Very beautifully done piece of glass and detail is superb. When i got mine it was broken at the stem &#34;most likely caused by UPS slamming boxes around&#34; but i was able to glue it back. It was shipped very securely wrapped but not delivery driver proof.
Good little hit, did not know this was a religious type song. Has that good bad to the bone style beat.
Fits my note 2 good and does not slide off too easily and snugs it just right. Sometimes lint may stick to it &#34;but that is because it is rubber like&#34;. overall with the skin on it i can dock it in my desktop dock that has pen holder style with no issues. Also gives good gripping surface while using brodit. Overall a good cheap purchase that beats the crap out of a folder or hard plastic type case.
Wonderful to hang on the wall for those who can't see well and enough space to write reminders on the dates.
Good!! This game is a fun game for game nights. Which you can use to see just about how good you are at recognizing different brands.
I ended up cutting the hood off - just too much material.  Lounger is perfect for when you get out of the shower but not warm enough to lounge in on a cold winter day.
I like this gloves a lot but the padding its not what i was expecting, much harder than i thought.
I like the song.  It has a catchy rhythm.  My granddaughter loves to dance to it. It does have one adult word. Not serious though.
The book captures the pioneer spirit of those who have settled this area of our nation and continue to remain. A good read with a historical look at an interesting situation.Book received in excellent condition.
I like the fact that the graphics are great and playing is really addicting. What I don't like about it are the ads that constantly crops up which is pretty annoying and you also need a fast and stable connection to be able to play it continuously.
These are great for zeroing a scope, pretty heavy duty carboard, instead of paper. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they were smaller than I expected, but I was a police officer for 17 years and I'm used to shooting full size targets, it's just me. These targets are more than adiquate for an air rifle or pistol.
Apellet pen is the only way to go when loading a break barrel air rifle. I gave it 4 stars because the little deal that pushes the pellets down could fit a little tighter. It very easy to accidentily push the pellets out.
Got the game for my kindle. Play it on my laptop all the time so thought I would download it to my kindle. It isn't quite as good as it is on the computer but it is still fun to play and I enjoy it a lot more than a lot of the games I have. I like that there are several different games in one
Works real good on most knives and easy to use.  The price was super and I will give one as a gift.
The case was really pretty. Even though it was a big more flimsy than I would like, I still like it.
The K & N system installation into my 2002 Tundra went very well with only one exception - the hole in the tube for the mass air sensor was not properly placed in relation to the threaded screw holes.  I had to use a half-round rasp to adjust the size of the hole in the tube to allow proper alignment for the screws that hold the mass air sensor in place.  Other than that, the installation went well and the performance is what I expected.  Very satisfied with the system.
I bought this game expecting skyrim with guns as many people called it.  But what i got was GTA on an island.  I liked the game but it didn't quite meet my expectations.  Overall good game but don't expect skyrim with guns.
A glimpse inside a rehab centre - written in such a way that you really have empathy with the characters. Superb!
its a wonderful ring and i have other ppl ask me about it and i send them all where i got my ring
Good mixture of humour and politics. Wish he had more stuff on kindle blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Before I bought this, I decided to do a &#34;DIY Z Palette&#34; and I was so excited to make one but it didn't turn out as sturdy as I wanted it too so I just ended up buying this. Really happy that I purchased this. I use these for my MAC & makeupgeek eyeshadows/ MAC blushes. I wish it was just a little more sleek though but whatevs.
THEY WANTED THE WHOLE ALBUM BUT ONLY BOUGHT THIS SONG. ENJOY LISTENING TO IT OVER AND OVER. GREAT MOVIE TOO.
I chose this case for extra protection, since I have 2 iPad dropped by my children; both resulting in dents on the corners and cracks on the screen.  And those damages occurred despite having regular cases (folder / organizer type).  This time I wanted something sturdier and more rugged.Most of the ones online are too bulky, and I expected to get the same.  I was surprise that this stronger and more protective case (for sure) is in fact more stylish, hip and slick looking than the organizer types.  I love it.
This is a perfect size for a small space in need of a light. This lamp met my expectations and I would recommend it.
If you're a Shadow Man follower like myself, then you know you gotta get this game.  However, it doesn't live up to Shadow Man Senior.  Let me explain.  Shadow Man is a black guy from the city down on his luck after failing his college courses, and squandering his resources with gambling and booze.  When a line of ShaMan and a Voodoo Priestess get mixed up in the line, Mike is transformed into the ShadowMan, Lord of DarkSide, or hell basically.  But with great power comes great missions and ShadowMan is required to collect Dark Souls before A certain demon named Legion does, and create demon humanoids bent on turning the world into a fiery carcass carved out of hell.  This game has tons of blood and gore, and VERY CREEPY sound effects, such as clawing people and pigs squeeling or the detestable screwing and surgery done to an infant somewhere in the back.  You also have to acquire different powers that enable you to do things such as swim in lava, climb walls of wire and coal, climb blood waterfalls and more.  This game is one OF THE BEST GAMES EVER developed.  Control appears a little stiff at least on the N64 version, which also has terrible graphics for this game.  I have heard the PlayStation version is way worse as well.  So, do the smart thing and grab it on Sega Dreamcast!  It's obvious a lot of care was put into this platform, voodoo cursing, biblical testing serial killer chasing game.  So the first one was A BANGER.  What about ShadowMan 2?  There are some cool new elements to it.  I like the fact that Shadow Man is bigger, and the special effects added to him when he enters Deadside is cool.  What is a little irritating are things like not being able to hack through wood with a machete, fighting three or more enemies all at once using unimpressive and unimpressive control scheme for fighting as a human, and dark region areas.  Even brightening the screen didn't do much for me on this game, because you'll still can't see anything. Even if you do manage to reach checkpoints and discover a few new levels and secrets, all in all it's super difficult to advance.  I cannot advance in this game yet, not even with the walkthrough.  By the way, if you find a walkthrough you're lucky like me, because it was almost impossible.  So if you love Shadowman and want to rise to the challenge, go ahead, buy it.  But this game is waaay too hard before it actually gets started.
For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]One year has passed since Laurel found out that she was a faerie. Even if she has come to accept what she is, she refuses to turn her back on her human life. But she is summoned to Avalon and now has to spend the summer to learn everything about magic and the world. Trolls, romance and a lot of information in this book.All these descriptionsIn this book, the author really managed to captivate me with the sceneries. There were a lot of descriptions that really made me imagine the places, without being too much and slow down my reading. But she also managed to leave a little to the imagination. The scene, or rather scenes that come to my mind are when we discover Avalon. All the details and the adjectives Aprilynne Pike used made it looks majestic! I wish I could see this place in real.Finally some detailsWe discover a lot about fairies and their world in this book. It was necessary because we didn't have a lot of information in the first book about any of this. The world is so developed, I loved learning about Avalon, the different types of fairies, how this world works, etc.Some development for the love triangleI  loved what the author did with Tamani and Laurel. Their chemistry is amazing. Tamani says some beautiful stuff in this one, I like him he is passionate and sweet, he would do anything for her. I could feel the tension between them and I want to know what is going to happen with this love triangle! About this love triangle. I don't mind them in a book if it's done right. In this book, it's not about if it's done right or not, but more about Laurel. I loved her in the first book, but I found her terribly cruel with the two boys.Love/Hate relationshipI don't know what to think about Laurel anymore. As I was writing previously, she's cruel. I understand she has conflicted feelings about which one she loves but sometimes she does unnecessary things that hurt one of the two. I also found her careless even after Jamison told her to be careful. While reading, I found myself thinking how dumb she was...I really enjoyed the book even if Laurel was annoying. I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see if my intuition about Klea is right.
This book is just like any other teenage supernatural novel, it is a quick easy read, and is very entertaining
These are great little earbuds. Fit in the ear nicely. Give great sound quality. These are my new main earbuds. Recommended for those looking for a great earbud at a low price.
I chose the cucumber melon scent. This product is highly fragranced. The scent is very pleasant. This is also very moisturizing. You really only need to use a little at a time to get the job done. Also, my dog has sensitive skin and this did not break her out. So if your dog needs to smell better or has sensitive skin this is for you!
Although a little too preachy, I had some good laughs. I like madea. She can speak a truth and have fun doing it
This was a great romantic read. Kinda similar to Twilight. I loved David! Bought the second book going to start on it tonight.
Yes, I like this package, is when I received when the price of $20, no difference to me, this let I regret.
Love love love it this one is made so much better looks cute and the spikes stayed on the back only thing is the spikes r starting to turn colors they aren't silver ne more
This was a great read, albeit the theory became a little complex toward the end. It was great to see historial truths blended into the story to add a taste of reality (albeit more of an entree that the main course!)
comfortable. the finger loop doesnt kill my thumb good support for me my only concern was some times i like the wraps a little tighter and with the velcro you can only tighten it down so far. overall i give them a A-.
Great dog house, but they didn't send the wing nuts for the clean plastic doors.. But other then that Great!
Very cute and wears nice. Not sure how I'll wash it though.  I'm concerned the fringe will hold up in the wash.
My pre-teen granddaughter decided to go with a Paris theme in her bedroom. The colors she chose are Black, Grey, Red and White. This cover was perfect for the pillow she already had in a different color. It matched perfect with the bedding we had purchased. Good quality and best of all great price!
I love the rubber, easy to keep a good grip on it. Nice design for those that doesn't want too much bling.
Good story line  excellent characters.  Couldn't put The book down held my interest almost like I was apart of the story
This game is very addictive and fun.  We would recommend the game for all ages.  We are entertained for hours playing the different scenarios
i really liked this book  was looking for more  in the  end i would recommend this book as a good read.
I REALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY NICE GROUP FOR THE PRICE. ALSO IT WAS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE I WAS LOOK FOR.
From meat to candy, I love the techniques involved. I will be a professional at this in less than a year.
Unfortunately, this didn't solve my PC issue like I'm sure it would, but I did eventually get to try them out and they work great! Were shipped in careful packaging and arrived on-time. A good product if you've got an older machine like me and need something with a little more power
Great for being at work or school on a break keeps you busy and figuring how to breed different dragons
I love this item. I'm still working on it. It is not a simple design, not for the beginner. You must have patience as it takes awhile to do. I think once I'm done and have it framed it will be an heirloom with our 10 grandchildren's names on it.
Enjoyed another Goldy tale very much--she does get into more trouble than most!  The culinary creations are a delightful addition to her writing.
I have read several of Lisa Jackson's books and they all move you right along through the plot. I would recommend any of her books.
Action packed adventure takes you to the Louisana swamps... Mexican  cartels, Santeria sacrifices are part of this can't put story.  Great read.
This product is a little flimsy but it's okay it does the job And at that price you really can't beat it
execute all the source code in the book.Some package needed to be installed and it wasn't explained in the book in detail.
It is handy and wide enough to display charts and diagrams legible.Only the experimenting feature of mp3 player is noisy and sometimes work strange.JB
Good read for the young at heart.  Obviously aimed at the younger crowd, but a good read. Enjoyable and sweet
Very good protection but the rubber on the back side doesn't fit tight as it should. May have to exchange it for another one.
Does the works! but consume to much battery, so I'm looking to add an electrical DC 4.5v connection for better performant.
A piece of it was broken.. where you unblock the cellphone. All the rest was in perfect conditions, good quality.
Was happy with the speed of delivery and the formula tast great. I reccommend this product to anyone who is looking for fast weight loss supplement and cleanse.
It really does everything that it is supposed to do but the hook will not close for me. I have had everyone I know try to get it to lock together but it is about 1/2&#34; out of place. Other than that inconvenience I have really loved the curlers.Oh yeah, they are not comfortable to sleep on so use a hooded dryer or make this a day project because it was one of the worst nights' sleep I have ever had.
The only place my dad could find this item was a half an hour drive. He is 88 so that isn't realistic.. He was so impressed that just like that we had his product.
Perfect for a light, easy read. Interesting characters in a  delightful situation that the author resolves in an really believable way.
Received this order fast. Tried it once so far, for a 10 minute stand up tan and I could tell right away I was darker. The smell is amazing and didn't make my skin greasy or dried out. I will keep using it and probably order another bottle once this one is done.
Have to admit I loved the story..... great characters.  Kept me in suspense. Pretty long book for a free kindle
Could not put it down once l got started .l love the ocean Sarah Collins is fast becoming one of my favorite authors
Very good quality.My only complaint is that lighter colors show more dirt. Not a big deal tho.I would get this product again. ;)
Good morning my love you too baby I can get it was a bit more than one just for the best sake I don't know what you doing tonight
My 4770k runs only 66 degree Celsiusfans are noisy and it's better be replaced by those thinner and quieter fans
I love mixing supernatural with good humor.  The only reason I put four stars instead of five is I had a hard time believing the logistics of the story.  Most of that is personal opinion but it was a mark against the book in my eyes.
Great for. The cost and. Usability .can recharge KIndle any where and any time .  .  ..need ed or desire d
A good series of movies. I've been a John Wayne Fan for a long time. &#34;In Harm's Way was initially difficult to find . Glad Amazon had it!
If you follow True Blood, Twilight or any other pop culture vampire stories and do not take the time to read Dracula you should be ashamed.The story dragged a bit towards the end but still a must read.
The brush has a very strong plastic smell when it first came, the smell stayed on my daughter hair when i used it. So gross.I cleaned it with mild soap and water. The smell is still there but bearable after a day.My daughter's hair is very fine, frizzy and tangled all the time. Even sitting for a few minutes on her car seat makes her hair frizz and in knots.The brush works well and she's not in pain.I need to stroke more to untangle her hair because the bristle is shorter and reach less hair than other \traditional\ brush.This brush comes in a mirror-like blue and very nice. My daughter loves it.I love this brush, i wish it doesn't have that plastic smell.
Siguiendo la saga,  es muy buena, nos cierra la historia con la vida de.Lucy, entretenida y rom&aacute;ntica....me encant&oacute; seguir la vida de todos estos.personajes! Recomendable!
I like it and it doesn't jam up like my previous one. I feel a little safer than before I got this.
I 'm satisfy with this product . It is exactly of the description that amazon does.  It is a good product.
I like this diaper cover. I'm not sure it would have fit her at 4lbs, but it fits around 7lbs for sure, which is why I just give it 4 stars. My daughter has itty bitty chicken legs and is very long and skinny, so I think that is why it didn't fit quite right at first. I love that the aplix tabs overlap. The snap versions of this diaper, which we also have, don't fit quite as well since they don't overlap at the waist. It's adorable on babies. Gives them a larger bottom so we had to go up to 0-3 instead of newborn clothes when she wears these diapers. It holds everything in, unlike the disposables. Definitely recommend this diaper for those first few months before the one size diapers fit!
I couldnt find this tea anywhere after being able to buy it at the supermarket, so i had to get it off here. Really nice flavor
I bought this shelf to tie my bathroom together! Easy to put together. A little flimsy though, but overall cute
It is most certainly a celebration. This book makes a great gift for those interested in New Mexico. Not necessarily a critical view but nonetheless worthwhile.
I did expect that there would be something included to allow you to track progress - but there isn't.  You can draw on it.
this book has helped me with my business courses that I ma currently taking to get my degree in BM
I dont think I've used this product enough. I've only used it a couple times. The cream smells bad, the spray wasnt that bad. They both feel fine on the skin. With a couple more uses I believe I'll be able to say if this works.
Nothing overwhelmingly amazing, but does provide a good amount of extra driving light.  We will see how they handle the frigid sub arctic temperatures of the Alaskan interior this winter.
Asus Nexus 7 is a excellent Tablet. its screen resolution, sound and performance are excellent, however I consider to the camera is not well.
Good!! GET THIS GAME TOTALLY WORTH IT. Playing with reAl ppl is great in this game all friendly.That's about all of it
Another perspective on life after death, or more appropriately, the true reality of what always is present.  An interesting approach of writing what was happening to his body while his consciousness was in another place.  Whether you agree of disagree with his vision, it is a unique possibility that lends itself to the expanding field of direct experiencing a deeper reality.
This was a really good story. I truly enjoyed this book. If you have a cat you can relate very well.
The set's appearance and surface detail are very handsome, but the clothe material is very light-weight and the adjustment straps do not keep vest fitted.  Still, with a little light alteration, it was just perfect for my son's junior prom.
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, writing, and acting. I hope the &#34;retirees&#34; are around for a long time. When they retire from acting, they will be much missed.
The cover is not bad it's not the most effective case you could buy. It's more for show and use it for that purpose only.
GREAT MUSICAL TOY FOR BABY TO HOLD AND LISTEN TO.MUSIC NOT TOO LOUD AND EASY TO HOLD ON TOO.
It was good reading this again, refreshing the concept that we need to be independent and individuals. That the power of the I must not be diminished and subverted by the \we.\ Living our lives as we choose, not how the majority want us to live. Enjoy this short novella.
I like how it fills in some of Bond's backstory. Tells the beginning of our favorite characters and our icons.
Great game to occupy the brain. I play it to calm my mind. Takes me back to when I was a kid.
Quint essential Palahniuk in every sense. Funny interesting absurd filled with outlandish characters and storyline recommend to everyone who enjoys this author.
These bulbs are of very high quality, no bad bulbs and the coating is the best ive ever seen. Also, the element itself looks to be red aswell. And the price is great. The only downfall is since they have that extra coating, they're not as bright as other 5watt c7 bulbs.If your not worried about brightness then this is an excellent buy.
This book was a gift so I couldn't really check it out in great detail. Anyway, I am a german living in the states and what made me buy this book and not any other one was because most of the other &#34;german cookbooks&#34; on amazon were written by americans inspired by german cuisine, or &#34;americanized german recipes&#34;.This book was written by germans living in Germany and claims itself &#34;not americanized&#34;!Since it was a gift I didn't really have a lot of time to check it out in great detail but briefly looking through it I think this was a good choice!
Kinda disappointed that it didn't have the chain at the end of the sword, but i didn't really care. Its not sharp at all (but the tips are) its kinda heavy too (: this is a really cool sword, it was so worth buying!
this book was different with all the different stories but each one held their own I thought that I would be disappointed after the first story but I wasn't. each one left me wanting more.
Having payed only around $100 for this watch i was pretty pleased with what i received. The watch face is gorgeous; the color contrast is beautiful and the sub dials give the face an intricate look.  Also the size fits my wrist perfectly since i consider my forarm to be relatively big. My only dislikes are the fact that the thickness of the watch is actually it bit bigger than i imagined which makes it feel a bit bulkier than i prefer and that the buttons on the chronograph are a bit clunky (ie a bit too big and gets stuck sometimes). But all in all i'm satisfied with my purchase.
I love this pitcher but I don't like the lid arrangement. The lid seals too poorly to shake the contents.
The Masters saga is good since it ties in the story for the Robotech series. Yes Dana's character is a scatterbrain but she isn't too serious either. I wish they would have made episodes for after the Masters and into when the Invid arrived for more detail about what happened to the Army of the Soutern Cross and the members of 15th squadron.
These are a good price and work as three season boots, similar to bogs or muck boots, however the craftsmanship is not as good as the far more expensive brands. I am not sure these will last more than a few seasons as I see a small section of rubber has come unglued to the neoprene after only a few months. It does not affect function yet, but it is probably only a matter of time. For the price I am quite satisfied with these as they have made it through 3 months of a Maine winter.
The color is meh. Just meh. Not horrible, but it is olive green with a bright green fabric showing. These were comfortable right out of the box. I could tell they were very well made and will hold up well.
I totally loved the phone, but unfortunately it was locked, but. I was looking for an unlocked phone. i am very disappointed by this situation.
This is great! My son loves it, the sleeves are really long but we just rolled the cuff up once and it fits fine. Thanks!
Just finished reading  Christmas Grace.  Couldn't put it down.  A well written story with well defined characters and story line.  You could tell exactly what each character was feeling but you could not anticipate how the story was going to play out.  You laughed when they laughed, cried when they cried but always kept wondering what was going to happen next.  I would recommend this book to those who love a good romance or good stories about the lives of every day people.
This product works for me.  The price was great.  I use it everyday.  I might order another in the future.
I have the medium and the large Rollypoly and use them on reqular bases, both have proven tough and convenient pouches. The roll up feature is very desirable,I believe its best feature, besides its very good construction.  I do not use the pouch very often in a traditional dump pouch function, attached to my belt or gear, but just as a compactable pouch to carry in my shooting bag to collect brass or carry gear while moving between stages in match environment.  The pouch has reinforced vents in the bottom and will stand upright by itself, if the wind is not to strong, with a few items in the bottom has no trouble with up right open use. Its sort of promoted as a dump pouch to be worn for magazine dumping, and can be used for this, though mounting variety is limited (thus only gave it 4 stars, gets 5 starts for durablilty and folding compact storage)..really, lest for me, it is just a tough, strong, well thoughtout folding, compact pouch that somehow is very useful for a variety of handy uses...in fact many many many times during events shooters ask me &#34;where did you get that pouch&#34; , &#34;who makes that&#34;  after I show them how it folds up..&#34; have to get one of those, now who makes it?&#34;
I liked the book but it wasnt quite what I thought it would be.  I thought it would have a better layout of the rememdies.
very handy cant beat the price wish there were more music production terms but overall a good handy thing to have
Looks exactly like the picture. not very protective, but very fashion forward. so glad i found it. i love it!
The size chosen for me from their sizes fit perfectly. The sleeve length and body length of the coat are perfect. It arrived ahead of expected delivery time, I am very happy about that! The ONLY thing wrong with the product was that the actual thing was 2 shades darker than advertised. Colour perfection is not a priority of mine, because I am happy so long as I can tell what the cosplay is with a  glance. However, if colour accuracy is a priority of yours, then so be it. I LOVE my new cosplay, thank y'all so much!!!!
Works amazing on my canon T4i, but I had to smooth the shoe so it would fit.I use it for a mic and a LED light for video.
We've been buying the jolly balls for sometime, they are a great distraction, keep the dogs busy and really take a beating.  They are a great toy/product for the price.
I met someone that was wearing nice cologne.  She told me that this was the kind she was wearing, however, I purchased it and wore it and do not believe that it has the same smell as the cologne she was wearing.  The cologne is nice and was as described, I just do not personally like the scent.  On the upside you only need to use a tiny bit!
It arrived on time it works great and for a good price it has been worked hard dropped afew times still works good.
Got the item sooner than expected and I have used it a little bit and its awesome and such a time saver. Worth the $12.
I was not expecting the end of the book to be so fast and quick to happen. I wish the ending had of been a little more drawn out but it was a good read.
This series from the start was humerus and down to earth .For a author to reach a seventh book in a series is a big accomplishment especially with a totally new a untested format . It is a brilliant with all the twist and turns from middle school threw high school this book is brilliant.
Great show interesting to watch and keep you wanting to find out what's going to happen the next episode one of the better Syfy shows out there
the burn pot is beautifully engraved and the wood coaster nice, but the top piece with the screen does not match. The burn pot is more of a engraved silver and black, the lid a plain uncleaned unpolished brass.. does not look like the product photo...  not a big deal I guess..  I give it four stars because of it.
This fits my husbands laptop ok, is a little tight for an almost 17\ laptop. Has a very nice picture of the dragons. A little thinner than we thought it would be, but works just fine.
I bought this book for my physics class. It is useful when you need to review material before a test.
I finished this book in a single sitting so I'ts not the biggest book around, but it was well worth the time and money I spent on it. I feel like the writing could have been a little stronger to make the &#34;intense&#34; moments a little more &#34;intense&#34;. That being said, there is some decent suspense. I feel like it could have been fleshed out to a couple hundred pages or so to make a full book. Maybe giving some back-story, and maybe flesh out the characters. But who knows, it's Dalglish, maybe after &#34;The Breaking World&#34; he'll make the backstory ;) Either way, another quality piece by Dalglish.
After reading the first I immediately came and got the second, and I am the better for it. I can't wait for the second to come out. This book has its issues, as do all books. But It's well worth the money, and the time it takes to read it.
The story was very interesting and kept you wanting to keep reading.  Would recommend to mystery readers.  Author did a good job in keeping you wanting more.
Had twists and turns.  Did drag a little bit but was OK.  Would recommend to read for mystery lovers.  Thank you!  B
Easy, simple and looks just like the picture. I like not having to carry much and this wallet does it all.
Fits well, doesn't slip or stretch off. Has done a great job protecting my phone from drops and falls. Looks just like the picture. The buttons are a little slow in response but it doesn't bother me.
For appreciative lovers of the Art Nouveau era, a particularly nice book. Illustrations are very clear and beautiful. Would like to see more pictures in color.
great
The author offers a simple and achievable plan with links to relevant info. However, his solution to cooking and heating water is propane. I would have preferred to hear about other options which would not require purchasing fuel, such as a solar water heater.
I love this game. I'd have given it five stars if I could skip hunting predators, especially the ones that are struggling to survive as a species. It simply goes against my grain, but in order to progress I need to.
I just received and set up the lighting studio. Directions were lacking simple, step-by-step walkthroughs for set-up but fortunately a lot of the stand equipment is modular and easily figured out. I did have a broken 105w CFL due to handling issues which I do not attribute to ePhoto and Amazon was great to refund a discount to my account to procure a replacement on their behalf. As far as the lighting is concerned - I was skeptical of using CFL for my main lighting but I have since changed my mind. I was pleasantly surprised at the intensity and saturation of the light. There are 4 combinations of lighting using the inner diffuser, outer, both or none. My 4 star rating is based on a decent product of good quality but lacks simple, comprehensive installation instructions for all the equipment in the kit.
i liked this purchased, this only issue i had was it seemed to take more than average time to receive the product. thanks
heats up fast, works well. I would recommend to a friend.  can be used to heat water for many things.
I purchased this because of reviews on this and similar products. I bought it used since I don't really care about the look of a book as long a s its reasonably useable. The seller I chose for ratings as well, and they gave themselves a large window for delivery,  but it came at their earliest projected date. That said, the book was in gently used condition. I've only just started to read it and so perhaps I may come back and provide a more in-depth look at its content and  information quality.
bought this for my nephew and he loves it!
I love the top of this shoe.  Not sure if the wedge is too big for me.  Size 6 1/2 was not available so I bought a 6 which I can sometimes get away with in a sandal.  I have to wear them around the house to see the comfort level.  I really want to keep them.
Looks just as advertised. Some slight cosmetic damage, but in great shape.  Can not wait till we use it tonight.
Nice quick read, likable characters, with a different perspective, though not quite believable. Would be a great young adult read.
A great case, especially if you are tight on money. Make sure the carrying clip clicks in properly if you use it.
A good romance . Not all the  characters developed the way one would  have liked but Worth the read as said before.
They are pretty flimsy but at $2.00 apiece they accomplish what I bought them for. To heat things up in the microwave.
Great paper hope it last and doesn't fade. I guess time will tell.
It charges items quickly, but takes a day to charge the Trent PowerPak Xtreme.This is for people who have needs to keeps power around at all times.
I purchased this watch band to go with the analog watch for my husband.  It is nice looking but we haven't put it on the watch yet so don't know how it will look or last.
i like this phone..Not alot to complain about except the lack of directions given with the phone.basicaly they cover how to get started on the phone...but not things like how to move and store things like pics from text messages oe multimedia messages. I still cant get my blue tooth to connect with this model phone and there is no trouble shooting for this in the manual either.i have a plantronic bluetooth.  The apps were easy to dwnload although i dont have a need for all of them....This phone clearly was made for people that have a wrking knowledge of android phones and their apps.
I just got this today. The massage is somewhat good, but not great. It is more like a low rumble than anything, but I didn't get it for that only. That was just a bonus. As a lumbar cushion on its own, it does a good job. I can already feel the effects of it after sitting at my office chair for a few hours. My spine feels aligned. I also like that it has a strap that you can tighten to tie down the cushion in place.My only concern is the durability of the battery compartment. The outer construction is fine and the foam is fine too.The color is also black, not a light grey as shown in the pictures.Also another poster mentioned something about the massage not functioning even with batteries in. The reason could have to do with the batteries not touching the positive terminals. I had the same issue, but after nudging the four batteries towards the positive terminal, it started working.
Fellow law students (also medical, engineering....anyone who spends their days reading out of giant books), this is the book stand for you.I'm not much of a reviewer usually, but this has totally changed my life so I couldn't help myself.Pros:No more stiff neck...worth the purchase on this point alone.Makes typing while reading, which used to be a time suck of shifting books and looking around, as simple as could be.Now this is true of any book stand, so why this one?- 1st of all, sturdy as can be AND tiny. No trade off here. Can hold even my biggest textbook (I'm looking at you, Cherminsky).-The clamps are really sturdy, but easy enough to move out of the way for turning pages, so no additional time wasted there.-Like I said...it's small. Smaller than I expected, so I was a little nervous, but it does all it claims to do and takes up less space doing it.-The adjustable back is great. Never realized how useful it would be to be able to change the slant depending where I was using it. Even found the appropriate angle for reading in bed, which was an unexpected benefit.Cons:You may have noticed that I only awarded four stars even though I can't stop rambling about how great this product is. As much as I love it, there are just a couple more things I would look for in my ideal book stand:- First, portability. Yes, this is small, but something foldable would be better for taking along to the library with me. Most of the foldable stands out there can't hold paperbacks and aren't adjustable, but a stand just like this that you could fold up and toss in your bag would be great. Wishful thinking? Sure. But the heart wants what it wants.-Second, with a bigger book (still got my eye right on you, Cherminsky), it's hard enough to use this when you're too close to one end of the book that I just don't use it at all. Basically, with most of the pages on one side the clamp can't hold it in place. Yes I'm talking about 1,000 pages, but since the clamp slides to hold almost any size anyway, I don't think there's any reason it couldn't be a little larger.TL;DR: I love this book stand... if you need one, buy this one. Totally adjustable, small, sturdy and useful. Love you, Actto!
A good book. Could not put it down. A good easy read book. Can't wait to read the next novel.
This item worked great on my 1994 Ford f150. why the need of spending all your money on different rim when you can just get these.
I use this headset on a desktop land line phone with a headset jack.Pros:Comfortable, clear sound, no issues with microphone.Cons:No mute of volume adjust on the cord. The cord could be a tad longer.Overall I would recommend this, so long as your phone has built in vol and mute features.
My second pair for work.  In between I have tried Danskos and Alegrias.  Did not like either.This shoe works much better for my feet.
I REALY LIKE THIS GAME IT'S LOT OF FUN TO PLAY. THE MUSIC IS GOOD . I LIKE THE BONUS PART OF THE GAME THANK YOU
Loved Lucas story.  It was told so well. A very good read. If you love warewolfs you will like this book.
This is a very good bunch of books no miss spellings very easy to read a good beginning to the series.
This was a good read but I wish I had started with a werewolf love story first it tells the story on how they meet. Gives more about their life before the changes. But still good to read..
Blood Struck was a very good book I really didn't expect this book to be so good and with all the excitement in it I just had to keep reading.
This was a really good book. I loved the way it picked up in the same place the last book left off. There is a good story line going on here.
holds charge well and fit as described fit as good as factory battery get anywhere from 1 /12 to 2 1 /2 hours per charge as specs say depending on how hard you use.
It was an educational movie; however, I am uncertain that it's 100% realistic, as many people aren't vegetarians. It's a difficult task for those who especially never liked vegetables to begin with.
I tried this with the Colon Cleanser. I wasn't sure with the combination if the Garcinia was actually working, or if it was just more of the Colon Cleanser. From what I can tell, it worked ok.
I could not stop reading. It's a page turner. I like that Michael Jr. didn't turn out to be just like his dad. I don't like that fact his father keeps getting away. He's just too evil. I think he's really the DEVIL. Can't wait to start book three. I recommend this book to anyone to read. I take that back, not no Christian. Lol.
GOOD read!! She has to get her life together. Instead of her mother protecting her she should of took her for some help.
was a little slower to ship than the rest of my order but for the price it was worth the wait. its hard to find a decent cell case for a guy that isnt just black for the droid 4. stands out and people seem to like it. i kind of expected it to be a little more rubbery since its &#34;rubberized&#34; but id definitely buy from this company again.
Great deal. Quality was much better than I expected for the price. Color is perfect match. Very hot although I did expect that as satin always is. Better suited for winter bedding. Looks great
Super cute! True to size and colors are as bright as they appeared. Comfy fabric but may require ironing.... Not that I'd iron baby clothes!
Only reason I gave this story  four stars was cause I wished it was longer. Very funny. I recommend to anyone looking for a quick read.
I love my mouse pad and my friend likes the one that i got for him. The only problem that I've had with it at all is that it has a weird smell to it and it has a tendency to make your wrist smell as well. With out the smell it would have gotten 5 stars.
Very realistic. Romance parts a little too long for me.Well written. Would recommend to anyone who likes a war story.
Well written/ did not want to put it downVery realisticLots of details and interesting facts tsThe end
This game is quite innovative in that it combines multiple genres including a variation of the point and click detective adventure, grand theft auto, and the Phoenix Wright-like choice dialogue system. The main issue I had with this game is that despite the great job with facial features, tone, and what not, that give you clues as to what you need to say. Throughout the game you are supposed to use these human features to determine if they are telling the truth, lying, or if you should doubt them about a piece of testimony. It can really be random, kind of like in Phoenix Wright games where the dialogue does not make clear at times to what you need to do, especially since human aspects that indicate you should pick lie, or pick doubt, are quite similar. Luckily, if you are a perfectionist, there are plenty of guides. However, this is the type of game you really can't enjoy the first time unless you don't use one. Another thing, and this is for the xbox 360 version of the game, before you buy, you should know that the game is 3 discs due to hd dvd's terrible storage capacity.
After watching the video on how to apply it. It took me the 2nd try to get it on right. Luckily I had 3. I like it. It doesn't even look like one is on there. Fits the screen perfectly.
Very nice book. One thing lacking...how to make suet. Love the extra info in this book. Great info for habitat and landscaping preferences for the birds as well as high of the bird feeders, the types of feeders, and even how to make a feeder. All very wonderful additions to a fun book of recipes for bid food. Except that most of the recipes call for suet and the book lacks a basic suet recipe. I can google that and the book still had valuable info.
Well done. The book has a good layout. Each section is informative and flows well into the next section. Very good book if your into our just discovering astrology.
Not what I expected. I thought it was a story about one of my. favorite  characters but as it turns out it is about a book of poems and. Life lessons still a good read. But not like the dirty parts of the bible.
A fun book filed with great ideas. Non of these were to difficult and each idea included pictures as well as simple instructions. This is the first \homemade\ type book I've bought and I had an expectation it would be short on graphics so I was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of pictures.
it is very fun and I like it but its just that it gets harder and at one point it will suck more then American dad. WICH REALY SUCKS!!!!!!!????  :( :) :D :( its boring.
this game is not as fun as people think but its prety fun game.  $tacy.  this game is actually realy  fun
It was a beautiful dress, I'm just too fat!!
Nice and simple design! Love the bright green color! Fast shipment.  Has some light scratches on the cover but you can's really see it after you put it on the phone. I'm satisfied.
I think she likes it but the verdict is still out on whether the cloud is better than storage on the computer. It is fast , new and efficient.
It was a gift. She loved the color and protection. That is all I know since it isn't mine. End.
So far it works very well.  Have tried it USB and also eSata and both work as expected.  Being able to swap drives with ease is a must for anybody who repairs computers.
I bought this belt for my husband because he goes thru belts like crazy. I figured I was going to buy a good one that would last. This is it! I will never have to buy him another belt! He has had to adjust to it and get used to how it goes on. (He complained that it took longer to put it on than a normal belt.....big deal it takes an extra 30 seconds!) Anyway, Im so glad I bought it!
I like it.  It&#699;s a great tool.  I LOVE the open assist.  I&#699;m going to buy one of their knives next.
For the price, this is a great item.  I don&#699;t really use the magazine pouches, but I put my Glock magazines in them and they fit great. I ended up putting the pouches on my backpack for things like a flashlight and glowsticks.As for the belt itself.  It&#699;s made well. Buckle seems to be pretty decent.  It&#699;s not a cobra buckle, but for the price, I&#699;ll take it.  I use it as sort of a &#34;duty belt&#34; with kydex pistol and AR-15 magazine holsters on my left side, my little rolled dump pouch towards the back, a kydex Glock holster on my right, with my survival knife just behind the holster. I have enough room to even add a mini blow-out kit.Four stars for another good product from Condor.
I was sort of expecting it to be a little small. But that&#699;s my heads fault, not the product.It&#699;s really lightweight, and looks good.  I think the brim part is a little smaller than expected... but good nonetheless.
I own a few Condor items: bags, pouches, chest rig... this was the first jacket.  I was a little nervous about buying it online, without actually &#34;seeing&#34; it and putting it on, but I did it.  And I'm glad I did.  I've only had it a couple weeks, but so far I like it. I think for the price, it really gives a lot.  I needed something that would be wind resistant, and offer rain resistance, that was lightweight and breathable. I think this jacket covers all of those needs.  I don't believe it is waterPROOF, but I think it's resistant enough for what I intend to use it for: Hunting, shooting, backpacking in Hawaii.As others have said in their reviews, the zippers as quality as I'd like, but they're ok.  I didn't see any frayed seams or anything like that, and the jacket seems to be well constructed.  For a sub $100 jacket, I think it's well worth the money.Don't compare this to a North Face, Columbia or Patagonia jacket...that's not what this is. You won't get THAT kind of quality and weather resistance in this jacket that's half the price!  Nor is this jacket mil-spec. Don't expect that either.It's an $89 jacket that offers a LOT for that $89 bucks!
This kit has all the stuff you&#699;ll need, (and some stuff you don&#699;t) and it wasn&#699;t extremely expensive.  The only thing I added was an airway for CPR, and some extra bandages of different sizes, and a small tube of antibiotic. There are bandages and single use antibiotic packs...but I needed more.  I use this kit for a summer program in Hawaii, and our kids are always getting small cuts and scrapes because we&#699;re outdoors quite a bit. So bandages and antibiotic are the first to go.I think it&#699;s well laid out, everything is clearly marked, and the clear plastic helps a lot when you&#699;re trying to find stuff. I also like the bright orange color and large print: MEDICAL KIT on the side, makes it easy to locate.  I would recommend this kit to anyone who is going to be outdoors on the water or in the mountains. I gave it 4 stars because I had to add those items, and I&#699;ll probably have to add some sunburn treatment (aloe gel or other), and an instant ice pack or 2, but other than that this kit is good.On a side note... yes I probably could have put together a kit of exactly what I needed so there wouldn&#699;t be any wasted space or unusable items, for about the same price or less...possibly.  But I knew going into this purchase that I was going to add a few things to supplement this kit for my needs so no big deal.  And I was impressed by the layout of the bag, and it&#699;s content.  If you want to see what&#699;s inside, Adventure Medical&#699;s website has some really good video&#699;s on all of their kits.
You can't beat the price.  My daughter collects old cameras so I decided to get this necklace for her.  I was pleasantly surprised by it.
My wife and I had some really crappy wifi out of our internet provider router but now we can go just about any where in our house and still be connected.Setup: This item was really easy to set up. By plugging this into the wall and connecting using your laptop you simply type in the URL included in the manual and you will have access to all the settings of the device! This takes 5-10 mins to set up as an extender or router.Dual Purpose: This can be used as an extender as I am using it for or it can be set up as a new router. I have tested this as a new router, and it worked amazing. I decided not to keep this set up as a router because I was just needing internet on a single device. If you have multiple devices being used on your internet setting it up as a router would be a great idea.Design: This is very solidly desinged and also looks very stylish. It has indication lights to let you know it is working and also has a ethernet port that you can use to set up a direct wired connection to your computer after you extend the range of the internet.Overall this item is great and really helped me get my internet working around my whole house! The best part of this item is you can unplug it and take it to a different room without having to set it back up as a repeater. This is a mobile wireless point so you can always have the best connection possible without having to worry about losing internet!
I am just learning how to manage cooking times, but, I love its portability and ease in cleaning. I would recommend for anyone who is not a big barbecue expert.
This duvet cover is extremely soft I absolutely love them to death. But there was one thing I didn't like the button that keep the insert in were not sewn on great when I put the insert in for the first time two buttons came off
Works great!!! Take your time putting on. Micro bubbles will work themselves out. Follow instructions its very important. Very strong. Note: I did have a problem with microbubbles the first one they worked there way out but left a white spot. I sent back to Amazon and received a new one. Amazon is great when it comes to returns. Overall you can never go wrong with this site I really buy verything but food from here lol
Heavy and big it is not for petite women or for dressy affairs.. After saying that I really like it as it beautiful and very fascinating.
I loved this dress, exactly what I expected. The night i wore it all eyes were on me, definitely recommend this dress.
Its a pretty awesome game especially if you have  the original dragons dogma game save to get the limitless ferrystone to fast travel.
Very Cute! And perfect for my 9 year old nephew to make his own Chocolate Milk with! I gave a 4 star because I am not sure the cup will last long. As it seems sort of weak. But it does its job for now!!! Great price for the Moo Mixer!!!
Love this oxo set!!! I am slowly acquiring all the sizes. They cost more than many other canisters but I find these to be unique!!!
For my first set of snap in hair. I bought two because it was priced so low. Im glad I did. I was able to cut six inches off one set and I now can make my hair look layered and thicker. I have had compliments on my hair both times wearing it!
I bought this for my 13yr old daughter and she loves it! She can prop it up with the kickstand upright or sideways for music videos, movies, and it keeps her phone well protected! I wish they made this for the Samsung Dart!!!! I give it 4 stars, would give it 5 if they made this for more phone types!! :-)
I liked this key chainChosed it for my black camaro ss keyNice materialRecommand it for people who like simple and modern design
This mouse was a major improvement from my old dell wired mouse that I've had for years. It is very lightweight and have 3 sensitivity settings that were very useful. The mouse itself isn't very comfortable in your hand, but like with everything else, you get used to it. I've had this mouse about 8 months when it started to act up. The left and right buttons would start to double click or sometimes wouldn't click at all. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the actual buttons, it might just be that the sensor inside the mouse is going bad. It gets very annoying when playing games and greatly affects gameplay. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because you will not find a better mouse for the same price anywhere.P.S. The LED in the mouse stays on even when I turn off my computer which is very annoying and the mouse must be unplugged every night.
it looks nice in my kitchen and serves its purpose well. my bills are finally organized with 1 section for bills not paid, 1 for recent paid bills and the other for important documents to be taken care of
Package arrived fairly quickly, which was nice. The case itself isn't bad; it fit my phone well enough. Not sure if long term use would scratch it or not because I only use it as a backup in the chance that my expensive case breaks.Good deal overall.
I got one from my mom and loved it. You can hold it with one finger. It closes tightly to slip in your bag, it fits in the car cup holder, it also is insulated so it doesnt sweat all over everything. But yes I dropped it while getting into my car and it broke, badly! I went back to order it from KMART and they no longer had them. I was sad, but I got the name off of my moms bottle and here it is. I love AMAZON! and am so glad I found my favorite bottle again.
I bought this for a guest bedroom so i dont know how it sleeps but it seems very comfortable. It is the third memory foam mattress that we have bought online. I think they are way overpriced in the furniture stores ($1000-$2000 plus) and it is the same exact thing, maybe with a different cover sewn on it.I also bought a mattress protector for this and I would suggest you do the same if you are planning on buying it. The only reason that i didnt give it 5 stars is because the cover is a little loose even after over 48 hours of unboxing.We have a 1 and 2 year old that cosleep and they have since birth, they love the memory foam mattresses, you can get up, or they can roll around without waking the other, thats not going to happen with a conventional mattress.
Once. I started reading this book  I couldn't put it. Down. I pictured  the scenes in my head. In other words I  was right there. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys clean books.
It's not THAT warm but for me it's fine in Toronto. Not great for very deep snow since it's not  long boot, snow may easily get into your feet. But overall, very pretty and comfy boots.
The wallet is perfect. Very small (heightxwidth), fits everything perfectly BUT with only 5 cards, it got really thick and can't even close. Imagina with 9
the picture is stunning definitely the HD it promises.  I was slightly disappointed to discover they no longer offer the special effects
This movie is a masterpiece the visuals which were a big part movie were done beautifully the tiger BTW is all CGI something I was astounded with the acting was done perfectly and the storyline is fantastic sometimes it feels a bit slow but its pprobably because I've seen it a few times all in all this movie gets a 4 out of 5 and I would highly recommend buying on Blu ray if you have a Blu rau player to appreciate the visuals this movie offers.
The candle warmer does a nice job and it was shipped promptly.  I only wish the light could stand a little taller so I can get larger candles under the light, in order to melt some larger candles.
Love the MJ and love dancing if you love both i recommend they have a wide variety of  MJ songs
i digged everything just not the bridge. had to order a new one online. also i didnt like that the bridge kept popping out everytime i kept tryin to tune it. overall i like the body work, color, and style!
Bought this for my bf for valentines day he LOVED it! He says its grease but yet washes of like gel or something of that sort honestly im just glad he liked it. Makes me look like an awesome gf :) Ladies I strongly recommend getting this for your loved one ...well if he likes this type of hair products
It was  good would've liked different styles, but it was good over all I really liked the color same as the pictures
Some inspirational mantras in this book but I certainly found more than just one simple thing to keep in mind.
4.5 starsKasie West has done it again. She just blew me away. Although in a way, I think I expected it. Pivot Point was so great that this one just had to be great too. It's awesome and made me feel all fluffy and light. Seriously brilliant. The characters, the writing, the story... Amazing!The Distance Between Us is about Caymen and Xander. Caymen is an only child and lives with her mom above their doll store. They don't have an easy life and it's hard to get around with the little money they have. Now Xander, he's the opposite. He's pretty rich and handsome at that. But you know what they say... Opposites attract! But will it last?God, what can I say about this book that hasn't already been said in other reviews. This book was so great. I loved all of it. I knew the writing would be really good. I mean, it was great in Pivot Point, so. And I expected the story to be good too. And it is. It's sweet, romantic, breathtaking and full of cute moments. Those dates Caymen and Xander went on were so weird and original! Well, they didn't call it dates, but that's what they were. And I loved that. And it wasn't insta-love. Their relationship grew and when to romance finally came, it was sooooo amazing. And they don't tell each other `I love you' immediately, which also is a great thing because I don't like that very much and it's not realistic. But this book was!Of course I loved the characters. Even the minor ones. I mean, Skye and Henry were awesome and so funny! And Mason... Yeah he was okay, but I didn't really like him that much. I didn't know whether I liked Caymens mom or not. Sometimes she was pretty annoying, but in the end I got why she acted the way she did. And I liked Xander's family!I loved Caymen. I really did. Her humour was just... hilarious. Probably because mine is also dry and sarcastic, so I got all of her jokes and I laughed out loud a lot so. She's *exceptionally* good at it. And she was very relatable, which made the character more real! But there was one thing that really bugged me. Her attitude towards rich people. Actually, that bothered me with her mom too. They made it such a big deal and the stereotypes were just stupid. So he's rich, so what? But hey, that's the only thing in the entire book, so. And Xander is awesome. He's so perfect for Caymen and I really loved him. He was funny too! Their conversations made me laugh and giggle out loud. (Not fun when I was reading on the bus and people stared at me...) Guess first impressions aren't always right, which is kind of the message in this book I think.Amazing book with a breathtaking, sweet and cute romance. But not just love, also friendship and a very good message about how first impressions can be very wrong. Kasie West, I won't think twice about buying one of your books ever again. I'm just going to do it. So is my copy of Split Second on its way already or...?
Wow. This story was... Yeesh... It was great! It was romantic, dramatic, and hot. Yeah, seriously hot.In this book we meet Erin at a very hard time in her life. The first chapter, the prologue gave me tears in my eyes already. And then suddenly we're a few years later and Erin has promised herself not to love again in order not to get hurt again. Makes sense, right? I thought so. Love can be a bitch. But she didn't expect to meet Alek, who turns her world upside down and tries to break down the wall she build around herself.The story started out good, as I already said. But the first two chapters after the prologue didn't really get my attention and I was easily distracted from the book. That changed when I started chapter 3 and the story began to get more and more interesting every page I turned. The double POV really helped in that. It made the story better and it got to me more and more every chapter.The relationship isn't rushed and that is a very good thing. It's not an instant love kinda thing. It builds and grows as the story goes along and I loved that. When I was about 70% into the story, I got a feeling what was going to happen and I didn't want to be right, but I was and I was crying and sobbing and then the end came and I was crying happy tears. So it's an understatement when I say this book is an emotional roller coaster.I really liked Erin. She had a tough time when she was young and that made her shy away from anything new and avoids love at all cost because she doesn't want to get hurt. So when she meets Alek, she kind of tries to avoid him because he is a huge new thing. (A delicious and handsome one at that.) She doesn't want that in her perfectly organised life. But she opens up to him and grows. And I loved her in the end. Alek was... omg Alek. He's yummy. He has issues and a past but he also grows and opens up to Erin. They help each other and learn each other how to love again and that was one of the best things in this book in my opinion.I hated Lila, by the way. God what a *beeeeep*.So Kas, I really really REALLY loved your book and I hope I get more of Erin and Alek in the future? Or anything else from you in this genre is fine too.This review will also be on Goodreads, my blog and Barnes & Noble.
What's up with the dystopian novels these days? Almost every single one I've read in the last month were great. I've read some bad ones in the past and lost hope a little for the genre, but David Estes' The Moon Dwellers gave me hope again and since then, my hope grew and I can now officially say that I love this genre once again. And this book was no different. I really liked it!Two Thirds of the world's population is wiped out after the worst war ever seen on the planet Earth. One of the survivors is Charlotte, a girl that can read minds. After losing her family, the New World leader takes her with him and soon she becomes his secret weapon. Her job is to make sure the rebels stay down, where they belong. Until one of them sneaks past her defences and makes her feel things she never felt before. But will this love save them or end them?I don't know why I've read anything by Janelle before. I mean... I wanted too, but never got it. I even won a copy of Eden in a giveaway a few weeks ago. I just didn't get to it I guess. But I will soon, because I love her! She's a great writer and I love her style. I'm normally not a big fan of writing in first person, but I didn't really mind in this book. But it is one of two the things that kept this book from being 5 stars. The second one being the fact that the double POV was a bit confusing in the beginning. I was really invested in the first one, Charlotte's, and then it switches to another person. And it's because of that first person writing, that it was so confusing. But that's really the only bad thing I can say about this book. I love the way Janelle created the world the story takes place in and I just love Janelle. Next to talented, she's also a very sweet and nice woman.I like the characters too. Charlotte is pretty badass. I'm sure she can kick some ass if she needs to. Yeah, she's beautiful, but they don't really use that as a weapon. She has to wear a mask to keep the fact that she's a girl a secret, so that's another thing I liked. She grows a lot in this book and even though she is a badass heroine, she's still vulnerable. That makes her human and relatable.I liked Pete too and Ramon and Ludwig and all the other characters, but Charlotte's my favorite, so.I am going to read the sequel when it's out and I definitely recommend it to everyone who loves dystopian novels.
Very good science fiction movie, with beautiful effects and great acting! Of course, many scenes were made with a lot of help of computer and graphics, but that's the beauty of using the technology to create something great. I personally expected some more deep story line. For me it was similar like The Matrix. Just in The Matrix human's don't even realize there was a war and in Oblivion they believe they have won the war but they have to leave..One of the things that really mesmerised me was the house where the main characters were living. Amazing house with even more amazing pool. I wish to have such living place for myself:)This movie raised me a question about what we believe to be true. Do we really know that something is true or we are just taking the things other people or authorities are telling us and considering them to be true? As you'll see in the movie, there is no true, there is just a created reality we are living in. Even though the scenes in the movie are science fictional, the concept of human life is a reality which is happening around you every day just in different forms.
Tasted grwat, as expected, but some of the crackers were a bit smashed, work on packing and these would have 5 stars.
I like the style of this shirt, however a little big  again would have like to have tried on first
Bought these shoes as a Christmas gift. The shoes aretrue to size and way better than sharing nasty shoes from the bowling alley.
Pretty classic game ,still a great way to pass some time..if you place first you shouldn't loose your coins.change this and would almost be perfect
No complaints after six months.Purely personal preference:  when stop watch function is no longer needed, I wish the next function would revert to time keeping mode.And since I use this for flying, I really appreciate large numerals in vibration prone environment.
Another movie I liked when it first came out - and, as it turns out, I still like it very much.
I like the color blue, but the color is not same in the photoit is beatiful and practice.  Good
The game is great! But too short at the end it states the second will be out at the end of 2013 well it's almost March2014 and its not out yet! Where's number 2?
I like the loose leaf version on this text book. It's convienent to bring the sections I need to class, and avoid carryig around too many heavy books. This text book arrived in a timely manner, it was in great condition and I was able to save money by avoiding the book store on campus.
Fantastic boot.  Great fit other than it was to small on my toes. Light an Very durable construction. Wish they would have fit
This game is fun. Challenging here and there and entertaining. Great way to kill time. Need five more words... ugh
These shoes claim to stretch and I am hoping that they do as far as the top seam is concerned.  So far they are cutting into the top of my foot and are not all that comfortable.They look okay but not as good as I had hoped.  Not likely to purchase this style again.
good sharp needles did my own piercings at home allot cheaper than a parlori would recommend these to any one.
Works well enough. Just can't seem to figure out how to tighten the knob that keeps it from moving up and down so easily. Maybe it's just me though.
its a good game its just if you dont buy glu credits you cant purchace most of the guns thats the only downfall
great addictive game wish i had whole game but its good for free just not that many boards unless u buy
I like it alot, use it quite a bit but I have to watch my usage of it because I CAN'T find it in the stores around here???????That includes, Target, Walmart,HyVee, Fareway, Walgreen's. I don't know why you put a good product out then you can't buy it???My Zipcode is 50054I live in Iowa the stores I shop are within 20 mi. they include DesMoines, Altoona, Newton?? Well I got that off my Chest, if you have some laying around send me some Richard C. Horton at 9784 Hwy F-48 W. Colfax, Ia. 50054
I bought this product a year ago for 2 stray,somewhat feral cats who now basically live on my balcony. Though not a perfect product, it is really a good one. The cats do stay pretty warm n dry. The winters are pretty cold in the Northeast and they sleep in it every nite. I think that it's pretty waterproof. Snow has gotten on the roof and it stayed dry inside.My only gripe is that it's  really not big enough, so  I just purchased the larger size.
Pretty good TCSM movie. Waaaaay better than the 2013 3D debacle. I really wish that this blu ray didn't have French on it underneath all the English stuff, but it plays and I guess that's all that matters.
What a woman!
Dress arrived on time for daughters military ball was very wrinkled had to take it to the cleaners the to have them removed but over all the dress was Beautiful
These mat's are really good, but they could have been a little longer.  For the price they are a real value.
Loved the story and setting as far  as real placesin San Francisco. To many typos and punctuation mistakes .
I got my touch pad some months ago and It was easy to setup it. But it supports very less video file format and we need to install some other video players if we need to watch all kind of videos. Also there is no expandable memory slot which I felt a big no. Also there is no rear camera as well.
Is really nice I purchase this item for my husband and he love it no complain very durable to it protect his phone good
The suit arrived earlier than I was expecting it, so I got to wear it for the two costume parties I went to! It was a nearly perfect fit, except for the too-big arms, but I had them fixed in just a few hours. If you're in between sizes, definitely get the smaller one. The fabric is really comfortable, and I got a lot of compliments on how it looked on me. I wore it as Anne Hathaway's version of Catwoman in \Dark Knight Rises,\ by the way, and everyone thought I looked very similar to the character. One thing though: be careful with the fragile zipper!
cost a lot but times have changed  thanks
There isn't enough new shows and full house isn't in there so it's not as exiting but I love it.
these are cute earrings . I bought them because I have multiple piercings and actually have these earrings as the ones that were used to pierce . I don't have the piercing gun , so I had to break the plastic . the backs are tough to put in , so be careful .
Information is simple & easy to understand. Helpful tips for first-time visitor to Tokyo area. The guide is worth reading.
This book is a very good book for fast reader's. This book is full of lots of action and fire I got the book after I read the first of the series. This book takes place right after the first book. I love the book and I recommend that you read this book.
I enjoy this show, the fairytale element is a lot of fun. the first season was defintly better than the second, but still cute.
love this app I have it set up for my entire family, keeps everything in order.as a family with a husband and 7 kids I need as much help keeping things organized.
Very very addicting hard to put it down some are super easy and some are very hard. I love it
Its pretty tough but if you do drop it you have to put it back together again.. which is better than putting you phone back together..
I bought this looking for my first set of Embroidery Thread.  It just does not have enough thread on the spools.
This is a great buy,  Colors are great, I recommend this set of polyester thread to everyone.  I will buy this again.
Works great in second child's room! Easy to add to one monitor! Simple to install. Clear picture in monitor. Thank you!
Didn`t no them in Denmark, but how they can play and sing. Hope they will go here for concerts maybe in the festival season
My Little one loved it!! I liked playing it too!! I would recommend this game to anyone with kids! Helps them to develop their fine motor skills.
A blessing to all men a must read it gave understanding to many things in my life to help me move forward a blessing to all husband and fathers pass the word on about this book.
This is a very interesting book and has changed the way I look at things in my life a must read tell all book pass it on it may help someone you know God has bless the writer to help others in many way in there life..
Good razor, only complaint is that shiny chrome gets slippery when wet, but it works well.Careful when shaving the chin area, small cuts result no matter how careful you are.
I usually avoid books which feature the authors name in larger print than the title. However, Laura Lippman blew me away with this fascinating story. I couldn't put it down! I suppose I'll remember to not judge a book by it's cover in the future
These daily readings are short, sweet, and thoughtful yet give you something to think about or meditate on the ideas presented.
I mean I've had better headphones but these are good I like the fact they have the little remote on the right string other than that never regretted buying them!
What's better then free books? Nothing. If you don't like the book, it's not a big deal because you didn't pay for it.
well Ive been looking for a size but its not here - i would love if u help me to find my size & its cause its my christmas presentim looking for Jordan retro 13 size 7.5
I purchased these lanyards as gifts for my grandson and his friends.  They loved them and liked to wear them with theirpocket knives on them when we went out in the woods hunting and exploring.  The very first day, the hook on two of thelanyards came apart.  The seller sent us replacement ones and I hope that they last.  The lanyards are great but the hookhardware is very cheap and does not last.  Seller is easy to work with and very helpful.
Great quality charm. Heavyish which is good because it doesn't seem breakable. I thought this would come with two charms and not just one for 4 bucks but I guess thats my bad. No problems with shipping.
Headphones are transparent and the cables are longer. The back up ear buds set is very useful. The wire is flexible and sporty
I would really give this 4 1/2 stars. They were shipped fast and a lot cheaper than others I saw online. The only negative thing I could say is that they were just a little thinner than I had hoped. I have mailed several things so far, and have had no problems, but I worry about something poking and ripping them open. I may just be out of line for worrying about that, because I have really had no problems.
Love this scale. The only problem I have is I wish the top were just a little larger. When you weigh a large item, it's hard to see the weight and hard to find the button to hold the weight while you take the package off. But if it was bigger, it wouldn't be so portable!! So, it works well and I'm happy. Needs 4 1/2 stars
covers everything. good book to have if you own a neon. i have done a full tune up and other minor fixes according to this and everything is great.
Solid, stable mount. Holds iPhone with phone protector well. I have not however used the dash mount part of this product (only windshield).
action packed, with memorable characters and lighter moments. my 8-year-old loves it, and I can watch it too. the racing is exciting and I personally find Anakin slightly less annoying when he's a small child. so, this is my fave.
I liked mine so much, I ordered one for a friend and he likes it too, now I am thinking about ordering another for my sister.
Not wanting to run wires out to the patio I thought I would give these a try.  After getting them delivered and seeing how small and lightweight they are, I was skeptical.  After hooking them up, I was surprised by how good the sound quality was.  They are very easy to install.  I used a 3.5mm Stereo Female to RCA Male Y-Cable to attach the transmitter to an audio out plug on my AV Reciever.  This way I can play CDs or listen to the music channels from Cable TV.  I have them plugged into wall sockets, instead of using batteries, since other reviews said the sound quality isn't as good with the batteries (although I never did try batteries).  I bought a second pair of speakers (comes with a free transmitter) to use on another section of the patio, still using just the one transmitter.  Very easy to set up.
Some scratches on the screen and quality isn't as great as the original but for half the price HP was going to charge, I'm satisfied.
Great book by Abbi Glines. I loved the story and the characters. Cage and Eva are one of my favorite book couples.
put miore cushion in bottom to soothe the feet make more space in th e front so they arent so tight
thy do what i neded I need my wrists braced for work and they do what i need to keep working
Reading this book made me wonder what else could happen.Can't wait for the next book of this story to come out.
just as discribed, will work great have many tapes to reviewwill recommend to friends who may have tapes that they are not sure how to convert
they were very beautiful in package but lost sparle when applied to cakewere not easy to remove from packaging
I haven't, of course, read the whole book -- I mean, after all, it is a devotional with 52 entries, so I assume the author expects you to read one a week for a year. But I have read several, all in one sitting -- I couldn't stop myself -- and I intend to dip back into this regularly (maybe weekly, maybe more often). It's a very accessible devotional, and not something you have to work at to read.That doesn't mean I consider it fluffy or frothy -- far from it. Rose Chandler Johnson covers a wide range of topics and bases each devotional entry on a Scripture passage. The passages she chooses are from all over the Old and New Testaments; they are mostly well-known verses, but she manages to bring a fresh perspective to them. She is able to be profound without becoming pedantic or obtuse -- and that is a hard balance to maintain.This would be a great devotional for a new Christian, but even the more seasoned believer will get a lot out of it, despite the fact that it is intentionally light reading. Have you ever read a devotional early in the morning, and just couldn't follow it because the text was too plodding? You won't have that problem with this devotional, but you will still be challenged by it.
Eddie Jones begins his book with a disclaimer that it is a collection of supporting material from the classes he teaches, and is not a \full-blown writing book.\ Be that as it may, this short read contains more direct practical advice than many of the \full-blown\ books I've read on fiction writing. focusing on four prevailing elements of good fiction --- plot, dialogue, characters and scenes --- Jones covers the essence of these, identifying where an author can go wrong and providing good examples of the right way to do it. Do I wish at times that he had gone into a point more fully? Of course, but then I would have had to invest far more time in reading the book. I like how pithy and succinct this book is --- similar to some of the advice he gave me when I wrote (and revised) my first novelThe Case of the Exploding Speakeasy. I'm sure I'll be referring to A Novel Idea again and again as I write my next novel.
It is agood car holder recomend u to buy it but moves alot while driving but generaly good stuff and the shipping was great i got it after 2 weeks not a month thank u :)))
As advertised.  I can walk around my living room and kitchen hands free while on the line with somone.Mmy cell phone is charging on a end table and 20 feet away.
This wallet iPhone case fits everything you need to carry when running to the store or out sightseeing, actually pretty much anywhere that you need to go. Great in places where your everyday pocketbook would be too much, like at a football game or to the movies, etc.  The color on this page makes it look like a dark purple.  When you receive yours it is more like lavender.  A coworker ordered the darker red one and it was more muted than the picture shows.  The only thing I have found that I am not completely pleased with is once you put all of your items and phone in it and place it in your pocket (if you don't want to use the wrist strap that is attached) it is a little bulky in you pocket.  Other than that, it is very convenient and come in many colors and is less expensive on Amazon than the ones I have seen around town.
Writer knows how to throw you off track to the real villain and keeps you guessing. Great sibling story along with local law enforcement corruption and a little bit of romance. Good mixture and diversity.
This book is very graphic. It took me by surprise and I could not put it down because I had to see where it was going. Not my usual type of read but was enjoyable.
I have charged it several times, and then attempted to charge my iPhone with it. I can't tell when it's working, and so far it has done nothing even though it was fully charged. It did not arrive with adequate instructions, and I would welcome any suggestions on how to use it correctly.  I gave it two stars rather than one because I figured there must be an error on my part and not totally on the part of the device itself.AMENDMENT TO MY REVIEW:  When I pushed down the small button for a quick 1/2 second, it finally registered with my phone and is charging it now. The error was on my part, albeit there are no decent instructions that come with it.  I am hoping for a quick charge.
I hesitated before purchasing it as I thought it was a bit pricey-especially because I have other low black boots, but the style is very classic and you can't go wrong with it. You do have to be careful when wearing these, because the leather is nice but somewhat delicate. I scuffed the pointed toes the first time wearing them - was very upset, but was able to work on the pulled leather and make it look a little less noticeable.  It is a comfortable boot, and hard to find. But if you treat it with care, you will get a lot of enjoyment from it.
It was good but when she goes into that time warp she stays. Which i was bored fromBut i t was good overall
Very good reading as usual, there is always a twist to her stories. Very interesting stories and I do endeavour to read all her books that are available.
worked great! Kind of a pain to get apart and clean out though. this one you actually get to hear 'em FRY!
was a perfect fit for my phone and worked perfectly the first time! kind of a pain to change out though! Needs to have a magnetic screwdriver!
it is not exactly the same as a griffin box like i thought, but close. not as thick, which i like cause i can put it in my pocket much easier,but the rubber is really thin, making for less protection. but has worked good so far!
I have found this book extremely interesting from the point of view of total lack of knowledge of what actually went on in Africa at that time and the very difficult conditions encountered by those who chose to venture into such an inhospitable continent. As if the conditions were not enough to contend with there were also the natives with their requirements in order to pass through \their land\. Sounds a bit like how things are today!!! Having said that I found it written in the very much journalistic form rather than as a novel. I now note this was the purpose of the writing in general.All in all a very good and enlightening read.
Beauty and beast collide within a female SPARTAN 3. She is not a child's toy.. these are for posing only! Her details are spot on. The molding is clean and her hands are smaller than most other Halo: Reach action figures. Making it easy to fit amything in her hand! Can be customized. Warning: Her hands and feet camn be broken off with slight neglect. Not for children.. the games arent for children and the figures arent for children either! Over all she is a stunning addition to my collection, standing back to back with Kat they complement each others beauty and ferocity alike
Very stylish! You can fit at most 4 cards (tightly) in the case. Doesn't really protect anything when dropped... But it is nice and I would definitely order it again!
I have long been a Sherlock Holmes enthusiast. While presenting numerous period discrepancies, this book is well worth including in Holmes fan fiction.
I really love purple so I knew this was for me and the fact that it was only $6 made me even happier.  I dropped my phone once and it had no scratches or damage, except for on the case.  This product is great so far.
I got the Haute Metal. It has a nice color and if you practice putting the polish on you can get it almost perfect, not too thick but not too thin. I used a dark red for my base color and it looks awesome. Will defiantly be buying more!
The polish is okay but the color is not nice at all. I have a lot of pink and red polishes, but this one just is not very nice at all. It does shatter nicely if you apply just the right amount.
These are very inexpensive and easy to use. They worked for me. You just have to make sure you only get the tip wet and nothing more or you might not be able to read the results.
This storage box is not big but just perfect for jewelry and such. The box looks very good only desk and does not stand out looking odd like others boxes I have had. The craftsmanship on the box is very good I feel.
I was going to a boating retreat on one of those friggin sailboats so my wife wanted to dress me up like Thirston Howell III! I got these sneakers since they looked like boat shoes and they were very comfortable. Kudos!
Asked the boyfriend to order these for me. I've got long skinny arms and they came up to just above the elbow on me. The dragon design looks cool and the material is comfortable so these were a win for me.
The brim was not as firm as I would have liked it to be but really nice hat and comfortable.
Nice  easy to read book with a bit of everything a mixture of light  romance, thriller and suspense.  Nice to read when travelling.
I liked this product. It's a good product and a great gift. My friend had been complaining all year long about how he can't drink beer and play Call of Duty at the same time. Well guess what I got him for Christmas.
Where or how do I find the next book....The Playmaker?????? I can't find it. Please help. I enjoyed the first one ALOT.
I'm pretty new to boarding, so I can't speak for this board's quality, but for a beginner, can't get better lol.
The cover is really cute. Although, I thought the entire case was has, but found the front had to be stuck on. I still like it for the price.
It is elegant and chic... I love it, the colour is wonderful for brunettes, the fabric is nice though it feels a bit heavy in the sleeves when they are rolled.
They fit great colour is gorgeous and the material looks and feels good quality. I've not washed it yet. They suits up to hip.
I bought this for my mom, It looks and feels good though the belt or sash it brings seems to be of a too much heavier fabric than the rest. In general looks and fits well.
I agree the sleeves are too long. Good material and beautiful colour combination. It is soft and looks elegant too
It was a good book right until the ending I cried the ending I did not enjoy it didn't wrap things up like I thought it would. Not only did many loving characters lost their lives but the heartbreaking sadness towards the end.
me likey
stays closed on string loop, free up my hand. takes a little time to learn repositioning hand(used caliper release for 15 yrs.)
so far so good ! husband is trucker and really needed this bought one for our son to ! Good product
I like this shirt a lot,I got too large of size but very cute and I can dress it up or down.
A little bit more challenging for the kiddies than the first one I downloaded.  Great game when we want to pass the time.
I bought these for my kids to help them read when we are travelling at nights.  So far, so good. They work very well.
Its smallest that i expect but it ok the bike short is cute. The material is  like for the bike i have some  for bike and it the same material. I like it
worked out good
easy to use; lightweight; it would be nice to have a strap since it needs to be hung up from a bulletin board.
nice for the price will recomend if startind a low budget music system not bad at all if you want to hear your music clearly i really enjoy this product
Much better than the Daybreak blend.  Much Bolder taste and better richness.  Could be a lil fresher though.  I would buy it again at lower price.
I choose this rating because this phone has met  my expectation.  I like that it is easy and very friendly to users like me who are not so much into technology.  I am able to use most of the applications such as whatsup, viber, magic jack and so forth.  I can recommend to anyone that is into smart phone
Good game with amazingly awesome graphics. Hope to enjoy it to the fullest and the midevil feel is very great.
Looks and feels real. not as long as shown in the photo but still looks great! Very soft too which is a major plus!
There's a little of everything from toe tapping, environmental concern, local heartland, history to life changers. What a buffet. Andy's musical expressions raised my awareness. If there was anything to all of this, I came away with - it is important to know and follow your passions, your interests, be engaged with living and have fun doing it! ... before it's too late!
This was the first novel I read by Jason Gehlert. As with any first time author I read, I am always skeptical of what I am diving in to but do so with an open mind. From the start, Jeremiah captured my attention with a pretty intriguing story line. It is hard to find originality (in my opinion) in a genre such as this but Jason has found gold with this storyline. Making a deal with the Devil sounds like an exotic idea, but the inner demons that are faced as a result of what must be carried out can weigh heavily on a person. I didn't know whether to hate or to love main character Jeremiah Black, and that was the beauty of this book. As the story moves on, you think you know what is coming next and then you are taken in a completely unexpected turn that leads to another great subplot. Just a fun, good paced read that has some pretty interesting twists with each turn of the page. As a first time reader of this author, I cannot wait to see what comes next from this amazing talent.
All in all, it was a very good read. It started out as just another &#34;how to&#34; guide, but it very quickly turned into an informative wheelhouse and I was able to set up a few new methods of promoting myself as I read it. I have read a few similar books and they all say the same thing - which isn't much - but Seumas definitely helped me to get a few more platforms going that I wouldn't otherwise have thought about. If you're looking for some good pointers and a guiding hand through the process, this is the book for you!
Its a perfect fit for my samsung lite tablet.
The lens bags were a little smaller than i thought but otherwise everything was perfectly fine. It is a great product a I would recommend to a friend
I learned a lot about lace wigs and types of glue.  I have tried three types of glue and nothing seems to work
I liked this book. It was different. I agree with another review, that it was weird to see that Logan went to school the next day after his mother was murdered. Who does that. But all in all I did like this book. I will be reading other books by Shayla Black.
folder is of good quality. I store paid bills for an entire year. the flaps are about 3/4 in. fully expanded.. some most used letters would be more helpfull at 1 1/4 inch
I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*I&#8217;ll start off by saying thank to the author for allowing me to be one of the lucky people who received an ARC copy of this book. In case I somehow fail to make the point in my review the most important thing to know about this book is that it is really good and if you have not read it yet, you should.One of the things I noticed and liked about the book was the pacing. Normally an author will go slow and set up the story and each character so that you get to know them properly before the conflict of the book starts. While that is a good thing for books that are longer, it also means that for me at least since the good part is hardly in the beginning I am able to put the book down and come back to it later. This one however jumps right into the storyline without feeling rushed.I loved Jenna&#8217;s character. It&#8217;s been a while since I read a book with strong heroine who doesn&#8217;t lose her mind and opinion just because of a guy. Jenna was an independent and strong woman who did not back down to others despite them trying to intimidate her. I mean to go back to the small town where your mom got caught sleeping with the mayor and led you to being a victim of the vicious rumor mill takes some serious lady balls. Another thing I loved about Jenna was her loyalty. Without revealing spoilers, I will say that Jenna&#8217;s attitude towards some people was very admirable despite what was happening. Like I said earlier, she was a strong character who did base her actions on a guy.The relationship between her and Josh I really liked how he did not judge her despite of the rumors. I loved how protective he was of her and although sometimes his actions were misguided at times, I never doubted his feelings for her. Josh frustrated me with how he reacted to some things but it wasn&#8217;t until the end that it all made more sense although I could still not justify what he had done. However his redeeming quality was that he was just caught in a difficult situation and he was trying to do his best to deal with it.My one complain about the book is the length. Now I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because I'm used to reading 250+ page books that anything under that just seems like too little or that it was actually a little short. But yeah while the story was not rushed at all I would have liked for it to be a little longer and see some interaction between Jenna and other people who weren&#8217;t Josh.As far as the ending is concerned I have to say that I have had my fair share of experience with books where I do not like the ending. Then after a couple of days of thinking about it I will sometimes realize that the author had a good point in ending the book the way that they did (except for you John Green, your endings kill me). This book was no exception, I had mixed feelings about it at first but now I am glad that the author chose to end it that way because it was true to the type of person that Jenna was.
I like games that aren't too easy. This one is definitely not too easy. It's also got a nice mix of games. My biggest problem with it is that it keeps wanting you to advertise for them in facebook. I don't go on Facebook and definitely don't want to let everyone know all my guilty pleasures. I wish that like sound effects there was a button so you could turn this off. Also, game lost the star because it asked me after every chapter to leave a review. If I like your game I won't need to be asked to review it. This should b knocked back to every fourth or fifth level. I didn't hit the don't ask again because I intended to leave one....so fix your game so it stops pestering people.
Within 5 minutes of play and after about as many pics they are willing to &quot;pay&quot; for a review....makes me wonder why. I like the concept of the game, I hope the product can meet expectations.
If you buy the tulip kit this book probably covers what's in each kit.  I found this book to be sparse. I expected to see a pic at end of each project. Especially since some were done in different colors from beginning pic. Gave four stars because it is what it says. Unfortunately what isn't said is that it is one long tulip tie dye commercial.
Purchased 12 of these units for conducting roadside work.  They work well for their purpose, but with wear and tear, the top cap falls off and becomes unusable (until duct tape is applied).  Aside from that, a good purchase based on price, but needs to be handled with care.  Not designed to be used as miniature lightsabres, but can withstand this type of abuse.
nice for the price - fits very well with openings for sound, start etc lined up.  Color good as shown.
I think it is very useful for reviewing some topics that you have studied before but you want to fastly review.
I used this book years ago when teaching graduate courses in educational leadership.  I was impressed by the steps recommended to involve students (adults, too, for that matter) in conflict resolution decision making.  While dated now, it still has value for anyone teaching or tutoring hard-to-reach or jaded high school students and trying to understand where their discontent resides. I sent the book to a person who is tutoring such students now in a charter school setting.
I like Joan Walsh's politics, and her views in this book generally fit what I have come to expect from her.  Content both supports and criticizes the white majority's difficulties in accommodating liberal social, political and economic concerns.  Book is comaparable to other liberal leaning assessments of domestic American life.
Its easy to install and hopefully will last longer than the three years the first one did.  It seems sometimes my two dogs both want to enter/exit at the same time and that was the cause of failure of separtation of one of the segments.  Nowhere in the instructions does it tell me how to teach my dogs, ladies first to avoid this problem.
Very strong in the beginning, but taste does fade quickly. Wish it would last a little but longer, but still very good!
good story kind of long. My husband works for the post office so i had to rub it in. he found it funny.
a bit slow in the beginning but builds nicely to the conclusion. Makes you want to read the last book.
Freezes my kindle every time. Had to uninstall. Really wanted to play with my toddler daughter. Thought it was an adorable idea and game.
Fits good, no bulk. Loosens up a little, and will slide down. Sure I can fix it . Cute and worth the money.
This is a really great glove for the price. They are definitely not a weather glove, but for warmer weather above 55 degrees, they are perfect. Very comfortable, and I am able to feel the movements of the throttle well with them. Very durable material so far. Will see how they last thru the season.
This was good  book. I thought it was a little too short. It left out information that should have been in it for the  price.  I would recommend  I  for a good read; th  price would be adjusted.
NYC will never be the same after JIM. Three squirrels and a goth chick can change your perspective, and you don't have to be afraid of getting too dark.
The bracelet has a great high shine and stands out with its thickness, but I expected it to be a little heavier. Four stars.
Don has a deep knowledge of his subject and great empathy with a little known culture.  A pleasure to read.
I appreciate that the Stamper/Scraper worked very well.  However, I would appreciate it more if the bottom of the stamper was the translucent white that the picture of the product shows.  I got one with a dark, hot pink bottom.  If I were to use pink or a red-related stamping polish with this stamper, it would be hard for me to work with because it would be difficult to see.  Luckily, I used a white stamping polish with this.  It works really well, easy to get the hang of even if you're a beginner like me.  I think the seller should give us the choice to buy pink or white bottom separately, instead of having a picture different from the product.  That's the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.  Don't let this discourage you from getting it, it's still a well-working product.
I wanted to buy my boyfriend some warm clothes and I came across this sweatshirt. Considering the brand and price I thought it was an awesome deal. He likes it. It came on time, the only thing is there was a tiny hole in the stitching by the shoulder. Super easy fix so no complaints.
I love the shirt and wear it often! I always buy shirts in size small so naturally, that is the size I ordered for this shirt. It's a bit tight, in hind sight I would probably order a medium. I like my shirts fitted, but this is just a bit too tight (although not enough for me to return it or chose not to wear it!).
It is what it is. Sender sent promptly. I wish it worked for More than just charging.  The product is better than buying a new cable for my car.
I thought the base would be wider to support the tacos, I'll review more before ordering things like this again
Ratio of US to World favored US too much.  World maps did not always have the detail I would have liked.  Overall, the information basicly was more than adequate.  Good job on that part.
Most of it is very readable and interesting to readers that are not specialists in the field.  There are a few essays that is obviously only written for people who understand the relevant field of expertise.  Love the concept and layout.
Item delivered on time and well packaged, slip case a bit worn. Essential Diana Rigg episodes from 1965 in B&W. It's called '65 DVD Set 2 (in case you get as confused as I do with the chronology nomenclature). Volumes 3 & 4. Vol 3: The Murder Market, A Surfeit of H2O, The Hour That Never Was. Vol 4: Dial a Deadly Number, Man-eater of Surrey Green, Two's a Crowd, and bonus episode Too Many Christmas Trees.
It was great to see a classic redone in HD. While immediately a critic's choice when released, it took a while for the general public to catch up with the unnerving and stark realism of the film. It's nice to finally own one of my top 10 movies in Blu-ray.
Item packaged well and delivered on time. Nicely painted, easy to hang and light. Fit my space perfectly, and held a nice variety of spice bottle sizes. Just a little pricey for a few slats of painted wood. Recommended.
they are not bad at all....they last a week and work wonderfully i would definitly recommend these to other people for use.
This is the best new cd I have bought in a long time. I don't buy new music very often because I rarely hear anything that captures my attention until this band came along. I discovered them by accident on YouTube. These guys are excellent song writers and have amazing vocal harmonies. I think anyone who is Beatles fan will truly appreciate what these guys do. I have no idea why they aren't more famous. I look forward to hearing more from them in the future. My only complaint of the cd is the lyrics aren't in it.
I am a C. S. Lewis fan. I love his books. I enjoyed very much finding out more about the man behind the books. He has a way of transporting you to the world he writes about.
It is entertaining, educational and challenging. Helps keep the mind working. Kid friendly. I am enjoying the challenge and thinking it through. It has cute pictures too.
These are so cute and arrived on time! Even earlier ! Only downside is that the one size fits all is not true. I'm pretty short and the cats face sits below my knees. Still so cute
I received Colgate Optic White Toothpaste complimentary from Influenster. I have never been a fan of home whitening products but this may have changed my mind. After using for a solid week I have noticed my teeth are a shade whiter. I also love the clean feeling that this toothpaste leaves.
They were really good books. I would say they are mostly for teens though.I'm gonna have to let my little sis read it.
If your using the old fashion razor this is great, I thought it would also sharpen todays safty razor; unless I'm useing it wrong it doesn't.  If you need a Barber Strop you will never find one as well made or priced as well as this one in a store. I do recommend it, it's well made.
This book was tender and sweet and taught me many life lessons that a young girl will need to know that I can teach my daughter when and if I have any.
Reading for my sailing interest but the history and interesting facts not generally known made it a great and factual read.
Material cheap
Great addition to the Nightshade novels! I really enjoyed this one and finished it quickly.The only thing that could have made it better is an extended &#34;ending.&#34; It just kind of stops...makes sense...but I didn't want it to end.Thanks Andrea!
The colors are great and really make for a fun dress up wig!I have already used it to give my profile pic a new &#34;look&#34;.
Nice size,,,,easy use....clean shave....needs foil replacements....how to order them???.Good price for the product.  Like the pop-up trimmer....seems to be easy on batteries....
Well, so far I think the ring is great. I 'm a mechanic and it proves to be a very durable wedding band. So I would give it a 4.5 star rating. The only thing it lacks is a little more eye appeal.
This book was very intense and exciting. I couldn't put it down. I just wish the ending was better. It's not clear enough for me.
A very comfortable, well-designed piece but really delicate, if you are willing to pay for non iron AND renew your shirts every two months, this is for you.
I really like it and it has been very useful. It is exactly what I expected. I really use it all the time.
The tips fit our existing arrows perfectly and may even be better than the originals.  Lots of tips at a great price!
Liked the way the story developed. Good to see the nerd get the pretty girl. Show that you should not judge people at first sight
I love this style, but ended up having to return it because the hole in the middle was very tiny. I wear size 0g, but it still was not as big as the holes usually are. I just didn't like the look of the hole. I recommend buying this one when your gauges are a little bigger than just 0g; it makes your plugs look tiny.
I have ordered about five of these exact keychains because they keep breaking. They aren't the best quality keychains, however, they don't cost very much. So if you're looking for quality, this isn't the keychain for you. However, if you're looking for temporary style, this is the place to find it!
This case fits a little snug. But is really worth the buy. My daughter loves it. And it arrived very quickly. Very pleased.
I love these things such a nice bass, the music sounds smoothly just everything about it is cool :) highly recommended
the only reason I'm giving it less stars than it deserves is because of the writing errors. there wasn't a lot but there was definitely enough for you to notice. But... this series is still amazing. I didn't want to put them down. I would definitely recommend these books.
Movie had a good performance. But the last 20 minutes of the movie could not be seen since it was freezing constantly. I bought it as used in very good condition.
This is really good for an app that was not made by mojang officially I used Honeydews skin and it worked perfectly the only downfall is that; honeydew maybe the only skin I have yet to find any others overall its good XD
this game is one of the very best games ive played. the pictures cant descripe the real graphics in the game.  my only wish is that they made all the zombies normal and not like left for dead where there are different kinds.some of the new zombies look pretty disgusting lol
Be careful when opening and closing the door.  If you accidentally shut it to hard batteries move around and turn off its electronic key pad function.  So make sure you keep the key in a safe place that isn't in the safe.  Overall for what you spend it is a wonderful safe.
I bought this after my four year old broke this piece. I tried super glueing the piece back together, but it would break at the joint every time he pulled on the piece and not the door. It was a good fit. It seemed a little expensive for a plastic replacement part but it got the job done.
Interesting read.  An unusual fairytale, but still somewhat believable and very enjoyable.  Beyond Cinderella with twist and unseen turns everywhere.
I like this story because it wasn't just your run of the mill plot line, the author keeps you guessing and entertained. Plus there are definitely some really HOTT scenes in this one. Recommend!
I bought this desk for my son.  He put it together and loves it.  The hardware and instructions were easy to use and follow.The only drawback is the weight of the piece once finished typical of particle board furniture. My son stresses that the hardware was excellent and quality.
This Jambu is one of the best shoes I've worn from this company.  Very comfortable, breathes well, but still feels substantial as a supportive shoe.  The fit is great.
This shoe its and looks great.  Great for a little more dressed up look and very comfortable because I can't wear hi-heels.
Fits great and gives great support for someone with foot issues. Colors are muted so take that into consideration Good shoe
Very comfortable, and good for those really hot days because it's a very strappy sandal but with good support. This sandal compares to the Teva with the same strap design only this is a little more dress up not just for outdoor recreation.
every thing i ordered i like every much ,only the bag maybe is PU leather smell so bad, and the bag top handle seem very easy loose.
It kept me watching, decent action adventure, not many &#34;bad words&#34;.Would recomend for ages 13 and up.I like the special efects, and of course ewan macgregor is one of my favorite british actors!
A story of losing a loved one is always heartbraking, specially a child. I have seen losing a loved one from a parents perpective, but this first time a see it with a hurting older sibling.Zac Efron did a wonderfull job, I will recomend this movie for ages 13 and up.
It keep me interested, the story is plausible due to online dating, action is good. Will recomend to ages 12 and up.
I was very excited about this planter. I got this planter to give as a Christmas present due to the fact that my mother has 4 pugs. When I received the huge box I was very excited only to find out that there was a much smaller box. That box had the pug planter in it. Disappointed I paid that price for that small of a planter. I do love the fact that is resembles a pug very well since how a lot things dont. I am overall happy with the product. I only wish that I knew it wwas going to be that small.
We wanted more space for family parties and this is the perfect tent.We're glad we purchased this tent. We recommend this product.
My old one stopped sticking to windshield. This one works great and stays on my windshield and doesn't wobble around,
I have owned one of these before and really liked it. My previous one had fallen in toilet and got ruined. Great sound quality. I can hear callers perfectly and they can hear me. I love that I can hear the callers # thru my headset and voice call by the push of a button. only wish it would say my contacts name but it doesn't do it for android 2.3 or higher. Other than that it's great/
I love this mousepad, it's not very comfortable on my wrist.. but still looks awesome!
I received this necklace fairly quick, it's beautiful and looks exactly like the photos! Taking off 1 star because the material is quite itchy :x other than that, this is a beautiful piece!
I LIKE IT BUT WONT USE IT CAUSE IT DONT HAVE THE FRONT TO IT,IT ONLY HAS THE BACK SO I GAVE IT TO A FRIEND!!!
Works well to protect phone, but doesn't cover the face plate at all. Has good feel to it! Bright color you won't lose it!
I cant really write much of a review because I ended up with not enough money to buy a mic, I'm currently using a webcam mic with a pop filter -_-On the bright side, I still can hear a difference. I think it's a good buy for anyone with a real microphone.
It was a good book and would like to get the next one.I like the author and her books.
He loves to play with this but one of the balls kept getting stuck so I threw it away. But other than that he loves it and dances to it.
Follow up after the interview is an important tool to have the information is need to know and a recommendation!
This is the funnest memory game I have ever seen.  The fun twist is t hat you get to see a preview of the game board before the timer starts and the pictures are hidden. You have to go really fast to beat the clock.I need to find non sexy version this game to share with my kids, etc.
I love it! I want it in blue as well! Very colorful and stylish! I want it in blue too
I had my reservations to how this book would have been having read so many 50 shades type of books.this book took me by surprise and was instantly new in its writing as well its plot growing just juicer with plots and hidden mysteries with every turn of page.In short would love to see how this series would take its turn as the story unfolds.Well written Anna Zaires.
I was pleasantly astonished to find myself wanting to finish this book and also read the series. They do have the predictable story line but who doesn't want to end a book with a happily ever after.It has all the plus points of giving the reader exactly what they want to hear and feel.Making it worth a read. Melody Anne has definitely the kept me intrigued and wanting to finish the series!
A lot of fun and it is a nice game. And I like it and it is a great nice game.
fun! not much control of the car just go or stop.. but still tones of fun but the battery only last 8min so that is inconvenient cause u have to stop every 8min and recharge it.
Makes sweet things taste so much sweeter and better! Made strawberries bought in winter taste like summer strawberries, what more can you ask for?
It was a good story, many women are living lives like this, sad but true...I recommend it, it held my attention
Since this isn't the first book in the series that I've read, I'm really disappointed that I'm reading them out of order!  I'm going to forge ahead and hope the next one and the last can equal the 3rd, which was amazing.
The two men in this story epitomize love as it should be.  It is sad how religion can be the source of so much pain.
I will be forever astounded at how we as supposedly 'thinking beings' can inflict such pain on each other.  I'm looking forward to reading the first of the books in the Coming Out series.
This is a great story where characters grow and change.  Relationships begin, end and reform, as life affects the participants in a myriad of ways.
After a rough beginning Alex and Shane have a chance at real happiness, and a built in family.  It was fleshing that Shane's mom stood by him.
I loved the story but now need to read the prequel and the next book!  I'm like Jude, I want to know more about their future relationship and whether or not Michael will salvage his relationship with his mom.
My first encounter with the work of Alexandra Cameron.  I'm definitely looking forward to reading a longer piece where she can really develop her characters and plot.  This was great!
This Book Is Really Confusing At First... Maybe Price Should Make His Books A Little More Understandable Sometimes You Know?
I have been very impressed with this book.  People that come over to my place eventually pick it up and start reading it.  The pictures, the way it is written, and the information it contains is alluring. You find yourself wanting to read more.  Well worth getting.
I bought this and the disk was bad.  Had to get a refund and ended up getting the game via download.  I like it.  It is not GREAT but it is good.  Esp with the price drop.
It use this for my X-T1 and two lenses, cleaning kit, batteries, charger, and still have room for any miscellaneous items that get handed to me while we are out.  It is a little on the big side for me but I like it.  The material is canvas and feels very well made.  The straps on the front are buttons.  The strap is nice and wide so it does not dig into your shoulder.  I am very happy with this bag.
I am teaching a course in Missionary Medicine.  This can be a helpful text as a supplement to the principle text being used.  The author provides a great deal of material in his website that is also of great interest..
Reasonable price, comfortable, big enough to carry bills and passport, no problems with setting off alarms from metal.  You need to be aware that it will be picked up on a body scan, and I have had to remove it on airline trips.
This is very well done as a missionary story.  If you are a missionary as I am, you will enjoy it.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the family in action - reminded me of my daughter and son-in-law in Suriname, South America, where they have a ministry involving their nine children.  It is not a drama, however, if that is what you want.
This wood whistle sounds just like a train. My little nephew comes over and plays with one i had as a kid so we bought him one for christmas to play with. I think he'll like it. This is a four hole whistle design and really sounds like a train.
Its a frame kit for pictures it works as designed. Probably could have come with some more smaller screws but overall OOK makes good hangers.
Nice big metal birdhouse. Good construction. Has three sections so you can fill up to three different types of feed. Big enough to where other birds don't scare off smaller birds if one or another is on an opposing side. lol I hung this using a metal rod style pole that grips to deck or porch, if this feeder filled makes the rod droop you can always put in vice and bend it to the right height you need it to stay. This feeder also is great and comes with post option mounting. Only thing is i wish the top was a little bigger than bottom as to better keep rain off or make more shade.
I'm not a fan of the command stickless stuff as in the past i've had things fall off of variety of walls. This one works well in the bathroom, i use it as a towel holder to the shower tub surface and it holds very good.
I am told it was a comfortable bra and straps fit nicely. For the price i've ordered more for her.
These are ornate tough little wood toothpicks, i prefer these over the bamboo toothpicks. If the price is right this brand is ok and comes with plastic container.
Holds well against the heat, is somewhat on the thick side. This style pincher grab glove is like most, i wish they would make one that has fingers, that would be great. Good quaility stitching and overall materials used are good.
It's good because it has oatmeal in it, and it has no smell which is plus! It does however leave my skin with a greasy sticky feeling that i don't care for, but it does help with my dry skin after showers and for general stuff. I do know oatmeal is a good natural moisturizer so it works. As far as Eczema, I would not know if it helps or not.
Got for my elderly mom and she prefers wide version but over all the walking of shoe was nice she said and the sole was not slippery or wore uneven so far.
I've used Sandisk for years, never seems to fail me. I got this brand because it was one of the cheaper prices ones for a 32gb at the time. Overall have had no problems with it. Reasonable transfer speeds.
Keyboard works good for the price on Amazon. Three led light choices to choose from Blue, Red, and Purplish i think color. Large print is good for those who can't see characters well. Light function can be manually turned off above keypad by holding in the led light button.
For the price and detail these are nicely done glass figurines. Made in China but still a really pretty piece.
This slot machine is really nice for the price. You manually pull lever and it spins, if you land on the right sequence money tokens will fall out! You can put real money in it if you want. It has a feature that when you put in the the money you can't access it unless you either win or hit the secret release. Overall a nice little gift for the person who never leaves vegas. lol
THIS BOOK TELLS WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE AMERICAN DIET AND SHOWS HOW WE SHOULD BE CORRECTING IT.  I'M WORKING UP THE WILL POWER TO GIVE IT A TRY.
This book is a very easy to read book.  There is really good information included between the front and back covers.
i liked the necklace only flaw is the chain but there isn't really anything we can do about it for the money it costs. Any code geass fan should get one
We bought this bag to carry the basic things during our last travel and it worked just fine. It has some handy pockets with easy access. great product and it look nice
its great!!! i purchased it for my 12 yr old girls...cause i didn't want to get anything to expensive...but i would purchase it for myself...the only thing i suggest u do is go thru it to make sure there was nothing that  was downloaded that might be inappropriate for kids...it also fits gud in the case witht the keyboard attached...other than.that..the touch screen slides bk n forward easy...color on screen ..wonderful..IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT!!
This is the best wallet/phone case I've used.My ID and credit card are easy to get to and do not fall out, plus I have a place for some cash...I don't have to carry a purse if I don't want to.
I really like this pink case. It is cute and it goes great with my iPhone. At first it was kind of hard to figure out how to get the cover on the phone, but eventually it will snap on. Also, they give you a plastic shield to go on your phone, but it doesn't work. Overall its a really cute case.
More of a photographic overview then expected. Hoping for a little more coverage of the filming and genesis of the films. The book is full of images I hadn't seen before, but very light textually. Still, highly recommended.
Matches the picture perfectly. This matches my skin color great. The silicone is really good and easy to put in.
I am stacking this with pes erase and i am having good gains.  Only drawback is it is a pain to have to weigh each dose of powder. make sure you invest in a accurate scale. This stuff really needs to be put into capsules as it DOES NOT dissolve. i take it sublingually with water and it tastes citrussy and not too terrible though. Still good value for price
nice game that is fun to play. the colors that are used are great. fun match 3 game with interesting graphics
I like this game because it has nice colors and sounds and is fun to play. I also like the graphics that go with the game
Cute book. You can see the story line coming a mile away but it is an entertaining story though it seemed to go quickly.
I found the movie to be very entertaining. The movie is in the same high class of movies that I enjoy such as: The Sound of Music, You Have Mail, South Pacific, etc.
I only bought this flat iron bc my husband accidentally broke my K2 flat iron. Not as great as the K2 but I like that it's more sleek & thinner. It's still a good flat iron though.
its like the 1 pic Multi word version pf 4 pics 1 word for Tv series fans &amp; couch potatoes
Colorful and heavy,thought might be cheap looking but it's nice. Should be good for outdoor display. Thanks for nice product.
Very cute. So far hasn't fallen apart. Wish I could make the strap a little shorter (I'm 5'3\) but otherwise no complaints!
I'm 5'4&#34; and 140lbs. I am curvy, so I bought a large. In hindsight, I would have been fine with a medium. My bust is really large but my waist is rather small so I usually have a really hard time finding costumes that fit correctly and don't make me look like a complete prostitute. I was really quite pleased with this costume. It came on time and in really good condition. My only real complaints were that the belt was WAY too large (but with two safety pins it was a super easy fix) and the boot covers would not stay fastened (but I ended up just tying the straps together and didn't have any more issues).All in all, this costume was a huge hit and suited my needs perfectly. I highly recommend!
THe children love their new trampoline.It is fairly easy to assemble, once you have made a mistake or two!In other words, it requires better assembly instructions.The blue spring protecting material on the edges is a little bit flimsy.Overall, I am happy with this purchase.
This product has met my expectations. It prevents clutter and the bags are displayed in a more orderly attractive way.
very attractive, little unsturdy but worth it. easy to assemble and smells good. decent sizes and loveley looking in our yard
I loved this HAIR I uses this HAIR over abt five  times maybe longer if I would have sew it in I cut it flat iron and rolled it
This game is original.  It has cool characters and a nice range of attack and weapons.  Starting off you play with two usable characters. One is weaker yet faster, the other is slower yet stronger.  The only thing i have against this game is the fact that the music can be really, really annoying, and the control is a little stiff. Oh, and you'll get stuck in the early quarter of the game.  I still don't know what to do.
This game has as many quirks and defects as a game could get.  The graphics and illustrations look like they were done by an 8 year old.  The story is wild and wierd.  Unfortunately, it's just not good enough to play without a few beers.  You'll find the control and special moves in particular are awkward, and if you never heard of Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure, this game in my opinion, is no biggie to miss.  If you're a collecter of wierd and random things however, you should buy it.
You know, people talk about this baby like it's a total abomination. It's courageous I'll give it that, and it also was innovative around a time when no one wanted to do add ons. At least, not till Sega did it. So I give Sega props for 32 x. I don't think it's ugly, in fact, I think it looks neat and easy to hook up. 3 cords are a little over bearing, but the bigger issue is getting the thing to work. It does not like to work. I'm being so serious. You have to clean it with alcohol and try again and again and again. But hey, it upgrades the Genesis and makes some games sound really good, like Mortal Kombat 2. Great game by the way, though I've heard people don't like it. All in all, I give the 32 x a thumbs up because it's a nice touch for Sega and some of the games look really kool for it.
This game is one of those discs that, if you never heard of it before or played it, and heard the great reviews from other gamers, you'd probably think its top of the line.  For the 16 bit world, it's not bad.  It has some really nice extras in it; the music when you fight Dr. Robotnik is fun to hear, not to mention some of the music from the other levels when you travel through time, and the graphics are nice and colorful. OVERALL HOWEVER, the music comes off as slack, the levels can be dizzying and annoying to tamper with, and Sonic does not have the lovable easy speed mode (you know, where you simply hold the dpad down, and rev up with the \a\ button? It's more difficult to do in this one.  You have to play it to know what I mean.  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 did this PERFECTLY. WHY NO ONE DUPLICATED THE PERFECTION OF THAT GAME IS BEYOND ME.  Plus, the 3D effects were really too early on to be terribly impressive. This game would have been better perhaps simply as a model for gameplay to come, not as its own independant disc.  Overall, as a Sonic fan I had to buy it, but it's not on my greatest games list.  You gotta be better than the old games Sonic, otherwise, you'll always get slammed.  Now the game is not impossible to get into, it's just that it needs perhaps a better introduction and cut scenes.  Without these the game is not that captivating, though it is a little refreshing to play a Sonic game that requires more accuracy and brainpower in spots such as in Casino levels when your'e bouncing off springs and such. It's really hard to describe the twist and turns in a Sonic game unless you've played it yourself, and most everyone has, and arguably everyone has their own acquired appetite that may be satisfied by this awkward game.  It's not the worst and it's not the best. It's cool to have that extra glitter in the sparkles when you're invincible and it's not like the bosses are too hard to beat, it's just that the past present scheme to the game doesn't feel too significant and the game will trip you out easily with the level designs.  Besides that the past and future signs don't do much besides change the design in the back with buildings and such.
I love this book couldn't put it down the only reason I didn't give five stars was for dialogue of all the characters seemed to be sarcastic which made a bit unrealistic to me, but good read
This is a great deal; however, there where fewer red and blue markers than I would have liked.  Good value for the amount of markers.
Its entertaining. Wish it had different themes. The controls are a bit too sensitive. Sometime you want to jump but instead you go to the left.
but cheaper then buying it elsewhere but that is just because its dora :( otherwise great quality and packaged nicely. I think its more suitable for a toddler or younger gal.
Pricey!!! I get fleece blankets at walmart for 2 bucks! But I was buying for the character for a handicapped boy who loves scooby doo he cant play with much so this was a good gift for him! After a few washes the string on the outside comes out but it was washed frequently in a short time so maybe thats why! If your buying for someone who cant use toys its a good buy if they can play with toys I recommend you spent the money on the toys better because the quality isn't the greatest!
We have this game on our home computer desk top and now purchased the game for the kindle fire.  Time just flys by when you are involved in the game
i realy loved the first two book but know i feel it time to end. waiting years for the end is a bit much . i would advise anyone to wait until  all books are out  so you can read them all at once .
this cleans very well and pretty fast. it has a nice citrus scent and i like the fact that it is all natural. i just wish it wasn't so expensive.
Came in perfect condition. It is perfect for a little girls room. Only downside is that it does look a little cheaply made
So having read the book, I too was at first confused on a lack of stuff from the book. However for anyone who read it, that movie would have had to been a lot longer to include it all! When you realize that, they included a lot of good stuff!! I really enjoyed Chase Williamson as David! I think he got it perfect, and the Dave/John dynamic was excellent!!! I will not include any spoilers, however I will say to anyone who has not read the book, you will more than likely not have any clue what the hell is going on, so just watch it for entertainment!!!I really hope this movie does well enough for the sequel, because TBIFOS is definitely movie worthy!!!!
great fast easy read, felt that he was blunt and honest. i loved this and read it one weekend while hiding from the snow!I am intregued by haunted houses ...... this sparked my interest
I spent a good deal of time looking for a multi CD stereo, and this one fit the bill perfectly.  It looks great, sounds great, and meets my expectations for an inexpensive audio system.  The only negative comment I have would be how noisy the actual changer operates.  Otherwise, it is absolutely wonderful to listen to my large CD collection again.  Just call me old now and be done with it.  ~ Enjoy
Very fun, great multiplayer, good graphics, just a great game overall. Fun for everyone. Need to write a few more words
Lisa Gardner has written another page turner.  You can almost feel the main character's desperation to learn how to protect herself from her evil Ex. The book held my interest from start to exciting finish.
What we were looking for were the extension lines with microphone in each unit so everyone can hear when a call comes in.  This unit works great.  Now we have no problem getting to the phone, and don't have to run through the house to answer incoming calls.  Our main telephone line stopped working, and the only working line was in the office... on the other side of the house.
I didn't love it but it was easy to ready and usually very interesting.  The writer has  flare for writing
I didn't need the entire book, but what I did need was perfect. Helped me learn some short cuts on my TI-83. Good book
This is a good little vacuum.. I bought it for my dorm room and it cleans the tile really well. I also have a rug and it does an okay job on that. It leaves behind little pieces of string that is stuck to the rug. But it is perfect for a dorm room. I bought it for $20 at Wal-Mart.
Does a good job but motor is not quite as powerful as I had hoped for. If you press very hard you can stop it. Otherwise a great product.
Excellent yarn; and some interesting twists. Unfortunately, poor electronic typesetting wherein words are &#8220;wrong&#8220;, causing some senseless grammar and syntax detract from the story. Autocorrect gone wild. The author would be appalled. This problem worsens as the book progresses.
had to sew some things because it had holes. but it was great after . very soft and cute. great
I like this product.  The taste is good.  I have not had my cholesterol checked since I started using it so I can't say if it has improved my numbers yet.
Interesting characters and settings.  A little slow at times but worth the wait.  I am looking forward to the next in the series.
Nice collection of shorter stories.  Normally I do not like &#34;shorts&#34;, but do admit this is definitely worth reading.  Fast paced!
Fresh new look and quality better than I expected.  Item fits oversized furniture well.  I would definitely recommend this item to others.
I have to admit, if I wasn't such a patriot/conservative and very concerned about the path of our country, I wouldn't have continued reading this &#34;roughly&#34; written book.  That being said:  if you can get past the bad editing, I feel you do infact have a pretty accurate picture of what the USA will/could be if we don't reign in our current president.I would suggest reading this book to friends but let them know that leeway must be given due to poor/no editing.
The idea of the characters not knowing the hows and whys of the disaster were much in the vein of LOST. The connections made during the adventure especially at the end were very X-file like. I like.
I received my book in a timely manner. Conditions of book was in good order. When placed in envelope for shipping, the cover and several pages got bent. Overall, a good deal for the price. Looking forward to finishing a hard to find series!
Item arrived 5-6 days after I ordered it! Love the material, and color.Im a mens small. I purchased the US Large. It fits perfectly. Make sure to get the right size!It's Korean sizes.Ships from CA.
As a puerto rican myself and having gone through similar experiences as Dante I quite enjoyed this book. I liked that I could identify as some of the things did and do still happen in the island and make this book relatable and believable while still  maintaining the concept of magical realism. I found it really inspiring and thoughtful as it teaches a lot about working hard for your goals despite what hardships life throws at you which make this book wonderful and comforting for the teenaged community who's constantly struggling with issues as the ones presented in the book.
We took these to Disneyland for our autographs books. The pen was big so all of the characters could sign easily with out a problem.  I also like the plastic snap holder it comes in to keep it protected while we were in the park and to keep it a little nicer for a memoir of our great trip to Disneyland!
New to herbal world....very informative.  Also, it mentions common uses and provides notes on proceeding with caution if certain health conditions apply like diabetes or advises not to use at all with certain conditions
The quality is very good but I have troubles with the shape because:1. the tip of the closed-toe stockings is to large and therefore visible when wearing women shoes;2. the small size below knee stockings that would be my foot size are to short, so I am forced to use the medium size and lose in compression.
I like the Microsoft Step by Step book series. As a Tech. It makes research quick and easy. There's a quick reference section to recheck when someone already has basic knowledge.
I had my doubts about this product but it really works right along with the diet. Try it you will be surprised and happy about the results.
THIS IS A GOOD MEDICAL MYSERTY IF YOU LIKE MEDICAL RESEARCH MIXED WITH MURDER THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU
Love the bottoms but ordered wrong size probably needed a small.  The xsmall rode very low in front but I still wore it because I was in Cancun and no one cares there.
Because they fit her good like their suppose to and she likes them a lot the style and color of the shoes!!
It used to be that I'd have to plug in my phone at some point during the day.  Now I have 60% of the battery left at the end of the day.  I've never even had to consider using the second battery.  I'm now able to install a lot of battery-killing apps and use my phone to it's fullest extent.
Exactly what I was looking for and the price was right Amazon is the place to go for anything you might need
This product has performed very well and was easy to set up and use. My only complaint is that one has to buy a wireless network adapter (at $70) to use the video-streaming features such as Netflix or YouTube.
The system and hardwire is fine. I can't resist install Ubuntu on it as soon as I receive the package. In the era of touch-screen, the cost of this kind of traditional computers are lower and lower. A good example of high performance at low cost. I don't know whether it is made in China as Chinese products are increasingly better now. Last words, Far Cry 3 can run very well on this computer!
Looks as though to be a quality product.  Form fit and function are all there and it bolted up nicely replacing the worn out hub/wheel bearings with no major issues.  Time will tell the true quality of the product (and if im bored one day may update) but for the price as of initial install and one day of driving I am very happy.
I love the item, and it does really makes difference on my skin color, i admit you won't get very light skin immediately, i am sorry if i only give 1 star at first, cause the first time i ordered, i didnt arrive at all. but considering by the products result, i am pretty happy :)
pretty awesome gun. I've had this gun for about a month now and nothing wrongs happened to it yet. Definitely would recommend  to all my friends.
I really enjoy the size and feel of this Rider and it is great because it is heavy enough it doesn't come up when you do. My only issue is I will try to pose it in an upright position and it will not stay in place. It will slowly drift back towards the torso area.
The phone case wasn't for me. It was for my little brother. Arrived on time and does everything he needs it to do. Protects his phone whenever he drops it and is pretty durable!
There are not too many fixtures that take the T6 Lamp, but if you got one, this is a inexpensive replacement; however, it's spectrum output is 2700K so be prepared for it to be a little more yellow than the 5000K Cool Whites.
Great way to waste a few hours. You can make purchases in game or wait to level up, or earn them.
works just as i expected it to. would recomend it to everyone. price was as i expected it to be
they are sheer, 100% see through in the picture they look thicker than what they are but i still used them
Provides great protection, doesn't make the iPhone feel too bulky or big, lightweight rubber case.The only issue I found (and I mean the &#34;only&#34; part) was that at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, there is a line of rubber in between each of the speakers and the actual plug-in hole, making it very hard/uncomfortable to plug it in and practically impossible with some of the bigger cords (like the one I use in my car to charge it or connect it to the car's speakers). However, once I cut these off (any kind of small knife will do it, it doesn't need to be sharp at all) the case worked perfectly with any kind of charging/linking device and I am very satisfied with it.
The ring fits easy...it's a nice little dress up ring..but you can tell it's kind of a cheap ring it's worth what you pay for it!
I have been using this for about 3 months and it is holding up well. Some do not like the velcro vs. a magnetic closing mechanism, but I am happy with the product.
I like the scent, it's a unique scent definatley an evening scent. It's a smell that is along the smells of the other Hugo boss...it's a good smell overall
I have had every cologne from armani code to drakkar and I have never had my girlfriend ask me to use it cause she liked the smell. It's a unique smell and definitely not for the truck driver type, or the conservative type, it's for the sporty, athletic type, someone unique willing to stand out...In a good way, it's definitely different, but ladies like it but don't use too much a spray or two will do.
The case is pretty good in my opinion its somewhat cool looking but like alot of the other cases it seems like it's better looking than it is for protection.
It's a good all around case but i did not like the big plastic feel and look. It didn't feel like it would protect well against falls or drops...I mean it's plastic, but don't drop it and you will be fine.
I enjoy it.  It is very informative on losts of subjects.All the LDS apps with Amazon are exceptionally good.
Very straight forward material. I took the test today and found it to be pretty representative of the things covered in the test.
came as advertised, new in box ...  this is a good case does the trick for those wanting protection at low cost.
thanks i have a hard time finding this so it was worth the lil bit of extra wait for semi slow shipping
The Camera has great picture and it is a good starter kit. The stand broke immediately and is really cheap. I fixed it with duct tape but very annoying and I will have to buy another tripod.
I liked this product because in my opinion I think anything is better than vista and that is what I upgraded from. I also enjoy the new start menu. But I dislike the different screens for apps.
great book with lots of smooth,  smoothies to make  super easy to make and taste so good! try some today.
Not sure why other people don't like these, The brushes arrived in perfect condition,I received this package in the mail, the brush set is not professional quality, but It is great for me, because I practiced nail art on my own nails, make beautiful lines The handles are made of hard plastic, the only thing is the brushes that i purchased are not the same as the picture.
The suit was extremely cute! But unfortunately the pants were too long for the baby. You guys should consider shortening the length of the pants considering most babies dont have long legs like that.
Good for my little son than I expected.Fit well He feels so comfortable and satisfied. I'm also happy that.
Fragrance to use day by dayI recomend for women whose don't like anything strongIt keeps for a long time
The keyboard arrived when expected. The keyboard while smaller is really convenient when writing long letters and such. The case itself is durable and will definitely protect the tablet. Even though the cord  seems to be OK I'm concerned long term if it will last.
I liked the movie and it showed how to people who are different can find love.and the story line was great but the sister in law could have had a heart
From the first time I opened them, I am extremely blown away by these headphones. My only warning is that your ears are VERY prone to get hot while exercising wearing these and it's easy for people around you to hear. The bass is powerful and the on-ear style is very comfy. This is the perfect companion to listen to anything anywhere, just not while active.
All the reviews say that the top line of the cover is off, and they are correct! However, if you can get over that, the color is awesome. I couldn't get over that though...blame it on the OCD tendencies.
We just received these are beginning to track my cycle, however I have to give them a decent rating as I am not knocked up. Will update next month.
I liked this soap, lathers well, smells good, and feels refreshing scent. The only issue was it took a couple weeks to receive, but worth the wait!
I like this professional CD player, user freindly and looks great.. we have a lot of fun with it...no regrets here,so far!
Like this- great taste-easy on stomach and decent value/cost for this good tea- helps over-all.will  order another bag- does what advertised to help do.
Predictable but enjoyable. I thought it was a bit rushed at the end. Some of the issues were not explored and sort of left hanging. Maybe they get resolved in the third book.
I am pleased with the overall product. The only problem i ran into was that after useing a heat gun on the strips,they wouldnt stick to the leather on my steering wheel like shown in the picture which is what i wanted most out of it. otherwise the product worked great around my stereo and shift nob which is made of some sort of plastic
I just started using this product. I really hope it Will work bcus I have something called Hormonal Acne and I've tried everything. Nothing works, I've heard good things about this product. ..it's really cheap at Costco if I may say so.I'm trying it out.
the tiller did what I hoped it would do its  easy to work around your plants in the garden and for the price its worth the money.
This book is so amazing no matter whaat other people say this book is just something especial and its so my theme
the printer is fine. the problen is with yield of the tonner, no one cannot help me with the yielding. I want to buy a high yieldig tonner, no one knew it, prety bad.
The quality seems pretty good. I ordered two of these for my sons outdoor birthday party to make it easier which it did come in handy so the wind didn't blow the roll. As far as making it easier to pull the paper towel off with one hand I'm not so sure about. At first it seemed to work pretty well. But overall I'm satisfied with them and use them a lot over the summer outside for our cookouts.
I have really enjoyed playing this game; however, it keeps crashing on me! In between levels or at the end of levels (not usually in the middle of one) it shuts off and goes back to my home screen. Not the worst thing ever but still frustrating. The game itself is very entertaining and engaging.
I dont get all the bad rewiews on here..........  I mean this isnt acadamy award stuff but i found it a very intertaining somtimes funny little movie.........
There&#8217;s nothing fancy about this product. It only has one elevation and is ideal for basic use. I do recommend.
I got everything that was said in the description and it is very useful and it protects my phone very well.
Love it
Very nice dress very bright and assure that I will be ordering again I were quite a few thank you
I finished 2BR02B in one sitting, and I enjoyed quite a bit of it. The concept was good, the story was O.K., and it ended just as quickly as it starts. I won't spoil any of the book for you, but I recommend it to anyone with nothing better to do.
If you plan on, or are reading the Godsland Series, I would highly recommend this to you. There's no point in not reading it, it's free, and definitely not a waste of time. I think it took me about 20 minutes to read it. If you're gonna read the series, read it, if not, there's no point :P
Not quitevas good as the first book but was well worth the read.  You can't help but love Nathan and Harv what what they do.  Adventureous and exciting.  Bea
Great case very slim.  I got the turquoise mint very bright color not quite like the picture but il like it just the same.  It for have sparkles so I would not recommend this for men.
I liked this book very much, it exsplains a lot about the life of a boy who is grown now. but reallycannot give up his dark interself he is deeply  unsure of who he is.
this book is very  true and  scary if you are not a christian. our world is in a big mess this writer  seams to know his bible well .i read all his books.
I am intrigued to see what happens next.  What's in the cards for them and who,is,this Q!?If you like suspense and love story this is a good one for you!
I loved the story, but hate the cliff hangers!!  Wish I didn't  have to wait so long till the next one
(5/10/13)Vendor purchased from:ArmyPropertyI've had this attached to my NcStar MOLLE/tactical vest(by VISM) for almost 3 weeks. I've no complaints about this product except for the securing system. The clips attach to the webbing perfectly, however, the straps that are supposed to secure it in place are constantly slipping which allows the carrier to sag below the comfort zone(wherever you prefer that it stays). I'm not military,  just a facilities maintenance person, but it seems that if I was carrying this all day and having to adjust it regularly in a combat zone or even in a security area,  I'd be a lot more annoyed than I am now being in an urban environment,  running from property to property, fixing, carrying, moving things. I plan on getting a heavy elastic strap and lacing it through the ends of the securing straps to see if that helps.06/20/13  The camo neoprene(or whatever it's made of) began pulling away from the top of the drink tube. My solution was to roll it away from the top to about half way, kind of like a woman's stocking, and then roll it back( I didn't let it form into a roll when pulling it back, but, made it slide down the length of the tube.)
I recently moved to a different state on a whim with little money and little clothes, and not being able to drive quite yet where I live now, I've had to resort to online shopping for what I need. Most my clothes are, shall we say, well loved, and I needed a lot of new things. These were absolutely perfect. I will say that yes, the tops unravel fairly easily, and one of the bows come undone, but other than that they fit great and are super comfy.
Great idea!  It made my best friend laugh out loud when he opened his present.  The binoculars themselves look like the cheap type that you could buy anywhere but the purpose of the flask makes it worth every cent.
haven't had a chance to read it yet but i loved the first book and i wanted them all in hardback
Comfy and sturdy!
Sturdy and comfy
I bought this for my niece. She loved it.
I guess the book was ok it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be! It took it a while to get going and then it was done.
As much as I hate to admit it, this was a really fun book to read. Romantic and sexual. Would like a little more proofreading, but I enjoyed it.
Easy, fun read. For the most part, very well written. Not a classic novel, but extremely enjoyable with a satisfying ending. Still makes me want to find out what happens next. Is there another?
Very very good cup, but you can't see the once because of the pictures. I recomend it anyway. Good for everything.
This book was interesting on so many levels.  It was a great looking glass into the history of a time that I did not know much about.  (History major, here).  It dispelled many myths I had about that particular century, (i.e. no one ever bathed), and it made me curious enough to explore the Hapsburg family to see how close fact was to fiction.Great read.  Simple and straight forward.
The book is huge with lots of pictures and great stories.  My mom doesn't like to read but said she reads a few pages a night because she has always loved Oprah and the blurbs are fascinating.
It is a very amazing study bible with complete comments. It gives me clear understanding of many verses which I previously di not understand. In short, I like it so much. The only reason why I did not rate it 5 stars is the paper which I consider too thin. But again, over all, it is a very good study bible.
I got this for a friend of mine for a Easter gift and he loved it and it's worth it!
While it was a story of a bad thing happening to a good person, it helped the reader to journey through the trial, the fear but most of all the lessons of faith . Faith is indeed the essence of the story and how walking with God builds one's faith.
I liked the characters.  They were real and one could identify with them.  The only negative was that the end was not as detailed as the rest of the story when they separated. Good otherwise.
OME, battery will last up to 4 hrs of charge. Price is high but it doing the job. Thank you.
This book reveals just how inconsistent information on the internet can be. For every truthful statement on the internet, there can be many more that are incorrect on the same subject.
I love my printer it works great easy to store but it took a while for it to ship, I expected it early like most items I have bought on amazon but it arrived on the exact date given which was fine.
A gift and apparently she likes it.  She likes to make jewelry and she suggested this book so I sent it to her.
I like the looks of this watch and was hoping it would help my husband in determining night from day since he now has dementia.  I am a little disappointed that the face does not light up for night so he can see the time.
Haven't heard how it works since it was a gift and sent out of town.  However, she did say she was looking forward to using this and the blocks the next time she goes to yoga.  She liked the color
I gave a 4 star cause one of the three protectors I got had a dent in it. So basically only 2 out of 3 of mine were good. They fit good and work good though.
These sheets match my room perfectly. They are nice I don't think there egyptian 1200 but they are at a good price and soft!! So its a win for me!
Im a college student who really dislikes going to get nails done and paying for it, so I'm deciding to do my own now. This came in the mail today, a very good amount for just starting out. I honestly had no idea what 4oz was (to lazy to check) but Im very pleased with the shipping time and how the product arrived.
I bought this tote bag for my mom, she's a Elementary school teacher. I gave it a 4/5 starts because the straps on the bag look a little thin and she tends to carry a lot of papers and books. Other than that, the shipping time and everything else was great!
It was a good reading book. Keeper my interest. I am about to start boom 3. I could nit put it down.
iThe cost is reasonable and it does most of what is required.  What I dislike is the actual size.  It is so small it can get mislaid quire easily.
This is a great ring. It is in sterling, and I do wish that somebody made one in white gold instead, but that is not a reflection on this product. Great for parents or couples. Very good quality.
Tender story of faith and new love. Worth reading and draws the reader in. Will be reading more by this author.
Product installed easily and has worked well. Should  come with documentation describing classes of products to charge with which USB outlets, products not to be connected to avoid damage, how to replace the fuse if needed. The little slip of paper provided is laughable.
Loved the story line. It was a great book. The only problem I have with it was it was just to short
Very good read this book was better than the last one was. I am going to get the next book hoping it will be great to read this one was just a good read. I just think this book was better than the last one
It is beautifully detailed  however, the charm is smaller than I expected it to be.also, there is nowhere to ingrave anything.
Got this in last week to go on a new build this is my first trigger guard with the screw assembly worked great took about five minutes to install  beats the risk of breaking your ears off lower receiver with drive pins.
I loved this book.  I would have given it 5 stars but I'm a little confused at the ending.  Is there going to be a 2nd book.  I sure hope so.
Don't expect this to be like the best of the best but its a good quality product. I recommend it (y)
Its ok I guess for the price. However, mine is missing a nub that holds the boom light over the head. Besides that, everything else is fine.
This is a good carrier to hold wine glasses. I was looking for something reasonable in price and simple. The unit arrived in great shape and was easy to assemble. The only thing I see as a con is that it extends way further than you'd expect, so the picture is a little misleading.
THIS IS A GOOD SCREEN PROTECTOR. HOWEVER, I DON'T LIKE ALL THE BUBBLES U GET TRYING TO PUT  IT ON. U MUST HAVE ALOT OF PATIENCES.
I don't read a lot of young adult fiction so this wasn't a likely purchase for me. I did, however, enjoy the book and found that I connected with the characters and wanted to know how the story unfolded. If you're looking for a light-hearted read with a little romance and a good moral, you'll like Capella Bright.
Shared very similar experiences. He kept the story exciting and fast moving. His thought about what going home would be like were true to life.
I have had trouble finding a good case for the Nokia Lumia 1020 , some were to bulky, some to thin. This one is just right and seems well made. Great for the price
I think the story line is interesting enough to hold you to the end.  ending was predictable.  But still captivating enough to make me want to read the rest.
I do like this show, and have bought two of my favorites, however, some episodes I just couldn't understand. \Screams in the Desert\ was one of them. Why would you meet someone who is making your life a living hell alone in the Desert??!! The one with the opera singer I felt was way over the top. Other than some others, this is a great show. It is worth watching!
I feel more enlightened by what the President said and how he responded. I have more respect for him because he understands what the real Americans need and want in life.
Es un libro completisimo en composites e interesantisim. El envio ha sido muy rapido incluso en laa modalidad de envio mas economica
Missed most of these episodes on TV, so I was happy to see them.  The five people on the show must have the best job in television.
Honestly,solitaire is solitaire, but this is a pretty good version of it. Loads quickly and has a hint button that can help. My only criticism is that there is a ad after every hand. Annoying.
A little tricky to adjust to the right height with monitors attached but overall it works very well and once adjusted is a very solid mount.
The lock is ok but it needed modification to accommodate the safety lock mechanism on the shotgun I want to use it on
This castle is wicked cute but I didnt realize how big it was! And it has poles which I didnt realize either. I thought for some reason it would just &#34;POP&#34; up when taken out but the poles make sense when looking at it to keep the steeple up. My mistake but my kids love it and we found a place for &#34;Santa&#34; to put it on Christmas Eve. Its now back in the bag and will come out when we make room in a bedroom!
So cute, comfy, and different! It's pretty true to size. The hoodie shrunk a bit so its a tad tight with a shirt underneath but overall right on.
I like the case but the screen protector wasnt the right one for the phone and the stylus doesnt work that great. Besides the fact that it kind of plugs into the headphone port of the phone and is in the way. I took it off and threw it in my junk drawer! The tuffy isnt so tuff granted these cases are very hard to get into anyway. One corner of the tuffy broke off into the slot of the case while trying to get it off. But other than that, I like these rubberized cases. Ive dropped my phone a handful of times and never had a broken screen or damaged my phone at all.
Ok so I gave this 4 stars only because I ran out of bluing to finish my project.  It&#699;s a GOOD DECENT product, so good as a matter of fact that I bought a second kit, as well as an extra bottle of &#34;Super Blue&#34; along with it. My only complaint is that I ran out of bluing.With that being said...I&#699;d recommend it to anyone looking to re-blue their gun.  Just be sure to buy another container of Super Blue. I think that works better than the Perma Blue they send in the package.I used this kit to re-blue a Mosin Nagant rifle.  The blue and rust remover worked incredibly well.  Degreaser was ok...I used brake cleaner and then wiped it all down with the degreaser, so I only used just a little bit.  The tru oil was good too.  I didn&#699;t use the stain at all, but I will on my next project gun. And I didn&#699;t use the wood conditioner either.  Instead I sanded the old finish off my gun, then used about 6 coats of the tru oil, and finished that off with about 6-8 coats of wood wax.  That worked out well.It was actually easier than I expected. Just take your time, and be ready for the smell!  Make sure you do this in a well ventilated area.  I did it in my garage, with the door open.  If you&#699;ve been thinking about re-bluing your gun...go ahead and buy this kit and do it.  This kit makes it easy.
I got this sprayer with my Duracoat shake n spray kit, and while at first I was a little hesitant about spraying the slide of my glock 34 with this...I am very pleased with the results. I also duracoated my Blackhawk holster, kydex knife sheath, knife handle, 2 AR-15 magpul magazines, my forward grip, AR buttstock and grip.  And I still have a little propellant left over in the canister.  This is just to show you how much I was able to do with just ONE can.As far as spray... YES, an airbrush would have a finer finish. But the finish on this was good.  Actually REALLY good.  My glock slide isn&#699;t completely smooth, and has a fine texture to it.  At first I wasn&#699;t sure about it...BUT, once I put my gun back together and racked the slide, I realized something...NO FINGER PRINTS on my slide!!!!  I&#699;m ALWAYS wiping down my slide because my friends gun has prints on it that are just STUCK now. So I&#699;m constantly worried about that.  But this finish gives my slide an ever so light texture.  And I like that alot.  On my AR polymer stock and grip it came out smooth.  LIke factory smooth.  I&#699;m sure it&#699;s because it&#699;s the polymer.  But it looks really good.  The kydex to it very well also.  l was very pleased with the results.I rated it 4 stars because I like it and I would love it if it were a little bigger, and came with smaller jars.  That way I could clean out the sprayer, and attach different color jars quickly.  Also, because it&#699;s a canned product, you need to be careful to shoot some out after setting it down for a few minutes to prime the paint thru the system.  But it works, and works well enough that I just bought two more of these power units to paint other gun parts.Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to use duracoat or any other coating application.
I have an AR style buttstock on my Flex 500. This LimbSaver fit perfectly, and it really tamed the recoil on my shotty, even with magnum slugs.  Although...it&#699;s gonna kick no matter what with those!  But...it&#699;s still a lot better than just the plain buttstock pad alone.  I&#699;d definitely recommend to anyone looking to put it on a shotgun!
Very pretty hand bag, its kinda small, doesnt fit alot of stuff, but would definetely buy again in other colors.
This costume was BASICALLY what you expect looking at it.  However, the belly was extremely baggy, and I'm by no means a twig.  An average adult male needed to stuff it with pillows to fill it out.  Also the snout droops considerably, which also had to be corrected using a nifty contraption that included a paint stirrer and some grocery bags...and sewing.  You get what you pay for with this costume.
I found it as a great gift option. Good size, and quality materials. Just as shown on the web information.
For the money, its really not too bad. I recommend it if you want cheap protection that wont break the bank.
Based off of Benchmade design, this is a good knife for the money. A wee bit of play in the blade when locked, but still worth the money. May need to be run through the sharpener and a good stropping when you get it, but that is expected from a &#34;knock-off&#34; knife. Bee is not a cheap brand though, so don't be afraid to purchase. Worth the money.
Great set of crimper and dies for the price,  The case is convenient and stores the crimper and dies securely.  Comes with a wide variety of dies.  It even has a die that will do large AWG insulated cord end terminals.  I believe it can go as large as 6 AWG.  Very hard to find one that does large AWG.  As for the ratcheting mechanism and the crimp, it does not come close to knipex crimpers.  I use the knipex master crimper with die sets almost ever day and there is a huge difference.  The crimp action on the Knipex is almost effortless.  I even have a dedicated ratcheting insulated terminal crimper from knipex and it is day and night compared to astro pneumatic. That damn thing only crimps insulated terminals and it's $130.  The problem is, Knipex will not only break the bank, but it will close your account hahaha.  I paid almost $200 just for the master crimper pliers WITHOUT ANY DIES AT ALL!!!  THE DIES ALONE RUN FROM $100-$200.  Laugh all you want but while you are laughing, I just rewired and repaired a backup generator that provides back up power to hospitals when a natural disaster hits.  I bought this astro pneumatic set as a gift for an employee/apprentice of mine.  He always complains that he has to use the old style crimpers with no ratchet where you actually have to squeeze to crimp.  He has some girly hands for a field engineer.  I tried his set out and I was so glad I didn't go cheap on my own tools.  This AP set is great for the auto mechanic or electrician but not for us engineers that hold life and death in our hands.  Sound pretty over dramatic huh?  I would give it a 3.5 but I will round it up to 4 stars.  Amazon, please try and get the Knipex tool prices to go down a bit.  Thanks
It had great romance, great story, alot of action.  Loved it better than the first book, looking forward to the third.
This product works well, was in good y family ... and i really enjoy playing it .goog job guys
The extinction Wars, so far, have been a great and fast read. Definitely looking forward to the next book in this series!
The speed button on the remote.I really love this fan. It is extremely quiet while still putting out a great amount of air movement. I love that it has 5 speed settings. I love that it has a remote. However, right out of the box, the remote will only control power and timer, but the speed button (to me, one of the most important functions because it is used in our bedroom) will not work. It boggles my mind that the other two buttons work, but the speed button will not. I'm not sure who I should contact about this issue, or if it is even covered by the warranty. Anyway, I still love the fan. Having a black fan goes so much better with decor than a white one and helps conceal dust that fans are bound to collect.
I read this on my son's recommendation and it was great read. So well written, thought provoking, sometimes poetic. Rings of truth in the portrayal of parents left to survive vs the children waiting to die. Touching on the dual existence of individual beliefs with an universal need to seek and give comfort. Tells the story without dragging it out; letting the ending quietly linger.
The sound allowed still seems really loud to me.  I wish I could control more and make it even quieter.  It gets loud enough for them to say it hurts their ears if we're not careful enough to make sure the volume is down from the beginning.
This product protects my tablet. There's better products out there I'm sure, but this one for the money serves it's purpose.I like it.
*ARC provided by Harlequin Teen via NetGalley. Thank you so much!*4.5 stars!Well, I think it's obvious... The first and most important question: WHY HAVEN'T I READ ANYTHING BY JULIE KAGAWA YET??? I really don't know. Geesh, this woman is awesome! I love her writing. She creates an amazing world in this novel and I actually get details on the worldbuilding, which is awesome. She fascinates me from the start and she got the vampires really good in this one. Okay the story seemed a mix of I am Legend, True Blood and a sniff of Hunger Games, but that's not bad, is it? No! It's more awesome!But seriously... A world were books are illegal? Just hang me already. I wouldn't last a day there. No books? No no no no no no. That's not how I roll. I need ma books okay? But I loved every part of this book. Part 1 was good, part 2 was better and part 3 was awesome. So yeah. You get it. It got better and better every chapter.Okay, the characters. I love Allie. I love her as a human and as a vampire. She's a kick-ass heroine all right. She's stubborn and she can really kick some ass if she needs to, but she's also caring and loving and she doesn't want to hurt anybody, even as a vampire.I liked Lucas and Stick, and I loved Kanin, even when I didn't knew his name yet. OH and I loved Zeke and his group. Yeah. Zeke. *sigh*This book is a lot of awesome and I'm going to read the sequel soon. This review will also be on my blog.
Sequels are always hard to write. People usually have high expectations if the first book was really awesome (which is was in this case) and it's difficult to live up to those expectations of all of your fans. But Julie Kagawa did exactly that, because this book is AWESOME!Yeah I use that word a lot, but it's true! Allison still is badass, but she annoyed me a bit in the beginning. I get it, she misses Zeke and to be honest, I would too, but come on... Just kick some ass and maybe you'll get to see him again! She struggles to keep her humanity and control her vampire side and doesn't always succeed in that. So I still love her!It was cool to get to know the other characters better too and see some old ones from the first book return! I did miss some of themJulie's writing still is beyond brilliant. I love how she describes the world she has created and in this novel we get more details of that world, which is great because it helps me to get more into the story! She keeps me on the edge of my very comfy couch and really hooks me to the story in a way not many authors can. And she can make me swoon with some scenes. I seriously was reading with a big smile on my face at times. She can take my breath away and crush my heart at the same time. (Thanks for that...)Of course she left me hanging at the end, which I kind of expected from her, but it sucks nonetheless...I give this book 4 stars because the slow beginning and Allison's references to Zeke in the first few chapters were a bit annoying but it's a great book and those who love the first one, will love this one just as much!
I really liked this book. I really did. It was original and I loved the mystery and the riddle Matty has to solve and I loved discovering it with him. This was a pretty good book.So this is the story of Matty. He's really smart. Seriously. I had a headache when he was talking or thinking smart things. Wendy did her research on that department. I liked the world she created and the references to this time. You know, the months, Yesa (I see what you did there Wendy, smart, really smart, lol.), That was really cool. So this smart guy doesn't like the school he goes to because the teachers are actually less smart then he is and he is bored all the time. So the King offers him a master's diploma but first he has to answer the question: What was January Black? It's a ship, but that's not the answer the King wants. So Matty has to figure out what January Black really was and I loved that we learned everything together with him. It kept me guessing and it was so fascinating. This was a really fascinating book.I loved Matty. Like I said, he gave me a headache every now and then, but I liked him. For some reason I kept hearing his voice in a British accent. Don't know why. I loved Iris and they were very cute together. It didn't feel forced and it was nice to see them grow as a couple. To see them fall in love with each other. I didn't know whether or not to like King Hadrian. Some times I did, then I didn't. Same with his dad. But I loved his mother.I don't exactly know what genre this is exactly. YA fantasy I think. So if you love that genre, you should read this book. If you don't, but you like books with mystery and smart guys that gives you a headache and sound British in your head, then you should read it too. I actually recommend it. The British accent thing. It's kind of sexy.
So an omnibus... Never reviewed one before, so I'm glad I liked this one! At some points it felt like 1 really long book, which is good. It flowed nicely from one book to the next and that's very awesome in a book. I hate it when it just jumps from one thing to another and this book didn't do that.The writing was good, although sometimes a bit simplistic than I'm used to in this genre, but that's okay. There's great character developement, they all grow throughout the series and that's awesome. The magic in this book was really cool and the world building was very well done. The romance in this book was sweet and emotional and it really fit into the story without taking it over to much.If you're a fan of this genre, I really recommend these books. They are written good and the story's great. =)Yeah, I know this is a short review, but I can't talk much about it without spoilers since I'm reviewing three books at once. Just read it, okay?
This is a cute short book.  Very interesting the thinking of the time.  I found it a nice escape for one afternoon.  Not of this era it is nice look at the turn of the last Century.  Enjoy.
I have been taking it for a long time now, its one of the best weight gainers I have had.
One of those movies that make you feel so small in this world. If you like special effects, it's a film for you. This movie is packed with them and great fighting scenes of huge monsters and robots. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it's not one of those movies you could watch over and over again. As I mentioned it has a beautiful special effects, but the story line is not very strong. The idea is simple, somebody attacks the Earth and people start to fight for themselves. It's just a standard hero movie with great development and implementation of special effects.
I absolutely love this agenda. It is super pretty and it has plenty of space to write. It is a perfect size, not too big not too small, and I love how the front and back flaps have a fold which allows you to store/bookmark pages.I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be better if it had a full month view at the beginning of each month and the material of which its made of can cause the ink to smear depending on what type of pen you use.
I work 12+ hrs a day with 4 computer monitors so these glasses where definitely a must have. They definitely help with the glare and at the end of the day I don't have a headache or feel that my eyes are burning! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they tend to get really dirty and the cloth they come with doesn't really clean them well.
The green will get dirty over time, but for the price it is well worth it. Protects the phone, and the color looks great.
Kevin Collier is a talented illustrator and this book is as cute and charming as his others. The story is simple and would be great to read to preschoolers, especially kids who love to draw and paint or are interested in sea life. It also has a sweet message and will help kids realize they, themselves, are valuable works of art.
The colors we received are the same as shown above. They seem to be decent quality. My 5 year old is a little tall for her age and weighs about 57 pounds. She usually wears size 7 so I got medium thinking they would be a tad big so she could wear them a little longer. She won't be able to wear these for probably another year because the neckline droops down past her chest. The bottom goes down a little past her belt line, so it's not too long or too short. They fit very loosely around her body. I would definitely buy these again, only a size smaller.
This is a great replica of the knife used in The Hunted. Good weight. fairly well balanced. Happyt to have it!
Thought this was a great action packed read.from start to finish it told the story of father and son and its bond even if they don't agree with each other.
Twisting the barrel to turn off is too easy to go even farther and place it in the &#34;remove battery&#34; position.  Not a critical failure but annoying.Does not pull hairs and is comfortable.In order to remove from package I recommend: plasma cutter, crowbar, and a circular saw.
DIN&Aacute;MICO, DIVERTIDO DE A RATOS. MUY AGRADABLE SU LECTURA. PARA LOS QUE AMAMOS LOS LIBROS, SER&Iacute;A MARAVILLOSO ENCONTRAR UN INCUNABLE PERDIDO EN LA BIBLIOTECA.
Great book! I recommend this! At first it's a little weird. But DONT STOP READING!! it gets better!! ;) (;
It was a light read and fun being able to relate to a lot, almost all, of his stories! Makes me love this sport even more!
Crayons didn't stay in the little casing the whole time and was hard to keep the crayons in there especially with a 1 year old pulling out the crayons but worked beautifully on the mat
One of the most incredible parts of the film is when one of the SEALS takes a foldable, seemingly toy airlplane from his pack, turns the prop and sends it flying over the enemy.  The airplane, then takes photos of all the buildings and terrain and transmits them back to an Aircraft Carrier, which then directs the strike.
I love this game. The only thing I would ask the makers to change is to make it so youre able to start a new game. I've deleted and downloaded it 3 times already (only had to pay once) just so I could play again once I finished it. If the makers are reading this please make an update that allows you to play again so that I so that I don't have to keep deleting and redownloading
Sapphique is a dystopian/science fantasy book by author Catherine Fischer, and is the sequel to the first book in the Incarceron series, Incarceron. The book is about a hero Finn, whom has escaped the prison of Incarceron, leaving behind his friends Kiero, and Attia. Upon his return, Finn finds that his stepmother is trying to prevent him from becoming king, and the warden of Incarceron has become trapped in the prison himself. The daughter of the Warden has become infatuated with proving Finn to be the lost heir to the throne and rightful king. Finn, and Claudia's life are put into Finn's hands based upon his ability to convince the courts that he is indeed the lost heir to the throne.There were quite a few aspects of this book that I enjoyed about this book. The story was filled with an amazingly large amount of content for the reader, but moved at such a fast pace, while giving excellent descriptions of what was going on. The use of imagery was actually quite excellent. For example when there was a description given of the glove of Incarceron, it was as if you could actually see the glove levitating right before you. Although the book had a wealth of quality content that I found to my liking, there were a few things that I didn't enjoy so much. For example, one thing that I didn't enjoy in the book was the dialogue, interaction, and actions of some characters. The dialogue for one, was quite confusing at time. Also, I found Kiero, and Attia's relationship quite dull, as there seemed to be a sense stagnancy to the romantic side of their relationship. It seemed as though their relationship was more mutualistic for their survival while Incarceron, rather than as a couple whom loved each other. Also I found that the actions of the warden's daughter, Claudia were quite unorthodox. Although this was a science fantasy book, I still can't grasp why she would cling to Finn so much, even when he showed disdain for her following, and affection. However, she was still an important character as far as the development of the overall story.Despite the unorthodox actions of the characters, with their odd interactions, dialogue, and all I found this book to be unsurprisingly excellent. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fantasy, and dystopias, of course. If Catherine Fischer did choose to write another book for the Incarceron series, I would read it without hesitation, because Sapphique is a quality read, that was enjoyed greatly by myself.
This book is exactly what has been missing for leadership in churches around the world.I read the whole book in the duration of one flight, and I finished feeling encouraged and agreeing 100%.I've known and admired the ministry of Benny Perez for many years now, and this book captures his heart and energy perfectly.The ideas and concepts in this manuscript are spot on to what I believe the spirit of God is saying to this generation while also respecting and embracing the practicalunderstandings of the 21rst century.I'd recommend this book to anyone in leadership looking for the perfect balance for the day we live in.Wonderful book!
My daughter LOVED the design and the ease of putting it on and taking it off when needed. Once ordered(at not on Prime) it was here in 4 days! Love this product and will order from this seller again, now that all four of my kids have iPods or phones!
These are a pretty good option if you want some cheap headphones fast, they work great, have a nice design, although their not my favorite type of headphones, I still like them quite a bit.
I love them, I just wish they fit in my ear a little better like ear buds. They are great for working out because they don't fall out if my ears and cords don't rip them out.
I chose this rating because they are practical and work relatively well for at least being seen by drivers however I would not ride and rely solely on the front light to see which you would expect for this price.  The one pitfall I came across was when fitting it onto my bike, the attachments or at least the screws were relatively small and I had to replace them with longer ones.  All in all, well worth the money spent
Love the Bluetooth keyboard and the fact it's pink. I've seen compatible items in stores for double the money but the colors are limited.  Don't like how my tablet isn't fully secure inside. It needs for corner supports,  not two.
We are in a time and a generation that focus' so much on the self. The desire to discover oneself, or to find oneself, or create oneself is advertised all around us. Which leaves us with the question. &#8220;What if people do not like who I truly am?&#8221; we ask ourselves. So we create a someone that we think everyone will like. As soon as that happens, there is no backing out. We must not only pretend to live that life, but we must make the stories more adventurous; describe ourselves as more free. We are left fighting against our own lies.Lomas describe the ways in which we create ourselves or see ourselves:You&#8217;re a mom. A dad. A child of divorce. A business owner or a freelancer. Male, female, black, white. You&#8217;re an introvert, an extrovert, a person who refuses to be labeled as either. You&#8217;re gay, you&#8217;re straight. You&#8217;re a success, a failure, someone who never lived up to others people&#8217;s expectations, or someone no one ever believed in. you control your own destiny or you cannot seem to escape the labels other people give you (Lomas, 27).He continues&#8230;If you don&#8217;t know the truest thing about yourself, you don&#8217;t know yourself. And that matters. What you believe about yourself determines how you live. We were made for something. Something bigger than the little things we seem fated to surround ourselves with (Lomas, 32-33).So then, what is that &#8220;thing?&#8221; I believe, as does Lomas, that Genesis tells us this quite clearly:So God created man in His own image; He created him in the image of God (Genesis 1:27).We don&#8217;t find our identity. Rather, we receive our identity. We are given it by God (Lomas, 69).Lomas wants his readers to know that the voices that tell you that you are not good enough and that you must create something more unique are not the truest thing about you. In fact most are lies created in your head.The fact is that you are a beloved child of God and He sees nothing but Christ&#8217;s perfection in you. This frees you to be who you are with no fear. You do not need to create yourself. The pressure is gone. You can now live free as the beloved. All those voices evaporate as the Father says &#8220;You are a child of mine.&#8221;  He does not need your acting. No. He just wants you as you are. Fasten the &#8220;Belt of truth around every morning.&#8221; The truth that says you are a child of God and everything pales in comparison.Highly highly recommend this book.
Pros:No input lag (Had input lag on the Elgato when used with a Asus monitor)Small and PortableRan the coolest between the Elgato and HDPVR2Roxio's device is supported by multiple programs.Roxio has a built in LIVE stream program which lets you stream directly to Twitch.tv (Hauppauge and Elgato will soon follow)High bitrate while recordingAmazing Price. I purchased it for $98 and I have seen people get it for less.Worked flawlessly out of the box. No need to download codecs..etcCons:Too light, Feels cheap. (The Elgato and HDPVR2 feels better)Does not include any HDMI/Component cables. At $150 retail I would expect it to.The Design. I think the USB should have been in the middle so it doesn't interfere with the output or inputs.Neither the Roxio, Elgato, or the Hauppauge HDPVR2 would display the image as crisp/sharp if I was to bypass the products.HDPVR1 still has better raw recordings than all the external capture cards I have tested so far. Elgato comes in close second with the Roxio and HDPVR2 following.Program randomly stops running after streaming for about 45mins. (This can be fixed in the future)Conclusion: At $100 you really are getting the most bang for your buck. I had a really good experience with the Roxio. I would recommend this product when it's on sale. At retail price I would be looking at Elgato's and/or Hauppauge's products to get the include cables at around the same price.
Its a very cute case but 3 of the diamonds are missing but it came faster than i think i really love this case for my phone i will be buying another one
Honestly I have been using the product for two weeks now and I have to say that I have hereditary dark eye circles but yet before I decide to write my review I look myself in the mirror with a bright light like a thousand times so I can give details of my improvement. Well first of all I use the product in all my face and neck, my face appearance looks more bright and my eyes look a little refresh that is why I didn't fill in all the stars bc I am still waiting on a more deep result on my eye area but honestly they look much better than when I wasn't using this product oh another thing I would like to add ladies if you have a minimal dark spot in your face this product helps!!!! Honestly I had dark spot on both side of my upper checks and I don't see it any longer so keep that in mind I guess since is a natural product it works great on skin. Ideally like my queen bee and when it finish I would buy another also ladies when applying this product on your face don't forget the sun screen is very essential :-)
I bought this for my niece for her second birthday and she loves it. It has all the things a little girl would need to carry a purse like her mom.
I really like this cardigan and the fact that it is long works out great. I am 5'7 and like shirts to be a bit longer. I have worn it several times and am pleased.
Microsoft Software.Thanks for your quick service in getting it to me, since I use Word and Excel all the time.
I really liked this case. It looked just like it did in the picture, BUT some of the stones did fall off.
i really love this cookbook. It was very helpful for me. It not only taught me how to make many yummy snacks, it also taught  me how to do the paleo diet the right way. I also loved how easy this was. I have a really busy hectic life, so i loved how fast these recipes were. It didn't take anytime at all to make these snacks. It also has great kid snacks, that my younger cousins loved. i'll defiantly be looking out for more cookbooks from them.
This story was definitely different from what I have been reading. Not at all predictable. I've been looking for a different kind of ending and I found it.
Just  LOVE  it !!!!
Well written and historically accurate (unfortunate as this may be).  If you have Italian immigrants from the early 1900's this may give you a glimpse of what they faced.
A story of life changing events and finding one's way.  I hated to see it end, hoping for a sequel.
This was an easy read and a very nice break from tougher reading.  I enjoyed the way she wove together the stories of several characters.
My wife loves the camera!  It is an excellent starter camera for those who want to learn more about photography.
Bought this for my HTPC.  Needed for keyboard and mouse function and not to control the HTPC side of the machine.  Easy to use and does the job.  Very happy with the product.
I Would Recommend This Wallet For Fans That Carry Light . Its Quite Crisp And Takes Awhile To Break In .Does Not Fold Well If Too Many Things Are Added . Its Very Nice And Has Many Slots For Credit Cards And Pictures.
Thought It Would Of Been A Lil Bigger But Its Really Nice . Bought It For My Husband And He Loves It . He Keeps HIs Ipod And His Dallas  Cowboys Wallet And Watch In It.  ... Well Packaged .
I love this case, I find it very durable! Easy to put together, and hard to take a part, which I find good if you have little ones around your device.
This is a very good album. It stays fairly true to the original, but with a few improvements. And the fact that he was able to have artists on the album that influenced the original makes it mo special.
Its an amazing helmet. Fits perfect to scale. only bad thing was the chin. its there to stop a lot of air from coming in but also prevents you from opening your mouth. I think it could've been more comfortable as well as flexible or adjustable. Another bad thing is the color. it gets dirty so fast. the finger prints are very noticeable and so are any little scratches. aside from those two bad things the helmet itself is amazing. fits perfect, looks great, feels great, the internal sunglasses are a big bonus, and the mechanisms on the helmet are cool. Great Helmet for that price!! Will def. buy another if I need too.
This is a well structured book with a clear, scientific thesis to its credit.  The rationale is well built up  and leaves one with the sense that  this is a manageable  process , maybe repetitive  in parts but  not a strain to read and think about.  Unlike many such books  it leaves a thoughtful residue which affects  what one buys  and what one eats.  That is a very good outcome.I could recommend it to friends and those concerned to manage their overall health issues, not just the question of losing weight.It must be a good read as I have returned to read it again several times.
Awesome quality and great price, would recommend. Although the colors do fade a little after a whole they are still good markers.
very nice shoes, i had been buying cole haan dress shoes and kept having a problem with the soles. so I am giving these a try. They look and feel great, I am on my feet for long periods of time and these shoes are comfortable enough to wear during that time. I am looking forward to see how they hold up through the year. My experience with amazon has been very good , the shoes were half off and arrived quickly , thanks
I love disney and my son loves mickey mouse, its cute, a little more difficult than i would like for kids as i even have a harrd time with it, but it cute and has nice graphics.
Making this super short, bought refurbished and a part of the screen doesnt compleately work all the time, its like a line going down the screen that is unresponsive to an extent.
The dress color came in darker than the image showed.  I was expecting a pale pink, more of a blush color, but it is more of a light tan color.  The length is too long for me, I'm 5' 2' with a little heal,  so I will have to take it to get hemmed.  Over all it is still a nice dress and I am going to keep it.
Fell in love with the royal blue dress but the top is cut very low. There were no Crystal-like beads anywhere on the dress that i received.  I was actually looking forward to a little beading, but it is still nice without it.Be careful of the neckline, if you are anything more than an A cup.  The &#34;Girls&#34;  will be quite exposed.  I am a C cup, so I took the dress to a dress maker to see if she could add about 2&#34; to the top for more coverage.
Got the shawl to use with a sleeveless evening gown for a wedding.  This will do nicely.  The chiffon material is nice, has a little weight to it...that's a good thing.  The hems are finished nicely; no lose threads.  Just needs a little steam to take the packaging crease out and I'll be ready to go.
It's okay for a starter kit.  I it has just enough stuff to start with.  We need just a little more thread.
I like the game even though it is not my favorite game in the whole wide world but thank you for making the game
It has one flaw though, it needs a door.  Also, not a complaint, but, if you do get one, take into account how tall your dog is standing on her or his back legs and allow for that.
It was fun. I had fun playing the game. The game was fun for me. Popping bubbles in the game made for a fun time.
Very good, long cord, easy use, durable. Everything I expected and and more. I would buy it again if needed.
I love this necklace becausr it's a simply cross that you can wear with anything ! I also keep getting good complements on it. But the only bad thing about this necklace is that it broke a week after I had start wearing it. I was just sitting there doing nothing and it just fell of my neck out of the blue. And the part that broke was the main peice you us to connect it. Now it is just harder to connect it in the back, but I deal with it because I love the cross.
This headset was incredible in every way compared to the headsets of my past! I was only sorely disappointed when after only having them for a little less than a year, the plastic holding the ears to the headpiece snapped. Clearly these weren't made for big heads. :(
Speechless...fabulous....addictive...must read more :) I cannot wait to read the second book.  I am dying to see what happens between them
better condition than I expected. good quality and included the CD, save me lots of money so I can't complain!
I loved this book. It kept my interest and had me wanting more. Can't wait to start the second book.
Costume looks exactly as shown. Pants run small in the waist, yet long in length. Coat runs large. I am a 36waist 34long and wear a large shirt, so i normally would have gotten a large, Lucky i read some really helpful reviews and opted for the xl, to which i am pleased. I hope this helps
OUR CHURCH Was studying this book so I bought it. The book is not adiet plan but a life plan.
this shoes is very comfortable and very usable ~~very ooood~~~!!i bought 3 sandals.i like it very much.
was very realistic for the halloween costume i used it for. its durable and is fully metal. i would just recommend getting the silver one cause the gold wears off after awhile.
This is a beautiful case that lives up to its description. It arrived on time and undamaged. The only thing I would caution future customers about is its finish. It's color is listed as &#34;gold,&#34; so there's no misleading advertising, but it is REALLY gold and very shiny. It's a beautiful case though and reminds me of a pocketbook for an evening gown...not a bad idea actually.
They didn't exactly fit as a 'legging', like I was hoping. They are larger in the butt and ankle area than I would have liked, but I still wear them weekly!
Easy to use a mobile. If you're taller than 4ft, be ready to tuck your legs behind you as you hang and pull.
This book is really great for those that have an artistic soul and looking for better life or business. I highly recommend it.
Only negative. Thing I can say is when my fish swim near the sides of the tank at the top they aren't illuminated by the light from the center. The blue night light is beautiful. The led light gives a healthy glow during the day, and overall the Hood looks and works great
It was a gift for my son but he told me he liked it very much and use it for the whole body.  That is all I know, sorry!
I love it! But there's some flaws like nothing really! Its so fun now i can reach my friends over summer! How cool! You should definitely download this app! Enjoy:)
I like it. Prints fast, clean, small foot print, for the cost its great. Wireless works perfectly. Ink is reasonable.
Thank you very much
Yes I liked this product.  Horror Hotel is one of my fav classic horror movies  Finding it along with another horror movie was a plus.  Very good value, arrived within 5 days.
The story should have continued into another book to see how things developed an how forest handled her new position. Would have loved to see the development between her an her father.
Interesting finale that ended up with characters dead who from the start is thought would've survived.  The finale is not a happy ending per say but a reasonable, practical one
Nice sunsets  Good quality viewing.nice  to see nice to view worthwhile download. Added to my kindle fire high definition image
When I read this book, it was great.I like how the characters in this book show their love for one another.A must read book if you like romance book. :)
Reading this seriers was a amazing. It was very intense to read. I really enjoyed reading this book and I would tell people about it. Overall it was great to read.
was a great accent to a winter wonderlannd themed party, arrived on time but not as sparkly and expected but will recommend
Brought back memories for a Baseball Themed Birthday party.  arrived as discribed, variety great , enjoyed by every one Thank you
arrived to late for event, pacckaging was poor, a few were brokenthey were beautiful, would have been great for our winter theme
This is a good read - always a surprising twist @ the end w/ Jodi P. I recommend this book.
A must read!! It was difficult to get through this book - a memoir written by a Canadian woman held hostage in Somalia for over a year - but I'm glad I did. I def. recommend this book.
One of the legs is loose, but otherwise it looks great! We are just using it for display so it works well for our purpose!
Its like a toothbrush attached to a motorcycle motor! Works great. I would buy this again next time well worth the money.
The copy I purchased was used but in decent shape.  There are no highlights or underlines in the text.  The seller shipped the book immediately and I was pleasantly surprised to receive my book so quickly.  As for the text itself, I would recommend this textbook to anyone interested in studying floral design.  It is a good &#34;go to&#34; reference for designers so a wise investment!!
This is a great game for my younger children!  They love it.....and would play all of the time if I let them :-)
This stuff works amazing on moluscum bumps!  I would recommend it to anyone looking for help with those annoying little bumps.
Subwaysurfers is a very good at a lot of good attempt said Fred Thompson and i know it is a very good at a lot of people who are not the Christmas carols and i know
Slight defect - case face bent when received, tried to bend back but thought it would degrade the water tight seal
Ok just doing this for the extra points because usually I don't do reviews but I gotta hand it to them the game is pretty awesome. The only problem is the controls. It will take a while to get used to them.
Good product but doesnt fit into the US plugs sometimes. I need few more but I'll try some other providers.Thanks.
This product is great! Very Satisfied!Pros:-Very Bright-Good Adhesive on the pods-WaterproofCons:-Connectors are practically useless
You can't tell from the pictures, but there is a glass case back, so you can see it work from behind too! Which I really like. Howver there is &#34;China&#34; on the back which is kind of dumb.I love almost everything about it except for the band.The band is very cheap, and it pulls at my hairs when I put it on. However, you can switch the band.
Got them to go with my Halloween costume. They're nice, good material, fit my fingers well. I have kinda long fingers and there is some space so if you have small hands these might not be for you. I'll use them for more than Halloween for sure!
i should have went with a dark roast. i like a medium roast, but with these i have to put 2 in to make it taste like a medium roast. i wish they still sold these in stores where i live.
sharp edges on the bar should have been rounded off a little. the sharp edges will cut your hand if you're not careful. but the tool does the job!
Cosplay worthy pin, did meet all my expectations, only problem is that the pin falls of easily. Fast shipping in a ok box with no damage to product
I finding ..easily torn in the under.soso ^^;;I'll just be coated.Quality is good.^^ thank you. ^^
Little thicker than the color screen.Still wear haeboni too OohMaterial doubt a very good thing, butSatisfied with the money.
Since the age of 14, this was my favorite Dickens novel. Having just reread it for the first time in probably 20 years, I  recognize the overt theatricality and floridness of the book, but accept those as part of its period. Dickensian truly captured the horror of the time. His characters, while certainly larger than life, are amazingly well drawn and colorful. I even found myself, once again, tearing up with Sydney Carton's final speech.
As a lover of fairytales and legends, I found this book to be both fascinating and frustrating. I know I shall have to reread it at least two more times before I understand all the nuances, innuendos and references. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying the stories and progression of the book.
I bought this as a present for an active granddaughter, and it immediately became THE gift. All the kids had to try it, and try it again, and play the music to dance to... However, as with any toy that makes noise, the electronic music became an irritant to some adults after awhile.
PRO: Does everything you need it to. Powerlines are a great alternative to wireless networking as long as your electric circuitry isn't all screwed up and they are paired. Great data rates :)CONS: Being in a split level house doesn't help this device at all. Reason why I took a star off is that it drops being paired once a week and is very annoying. Tested with another location with only one floor and the issue still remained.Other thoughts: I like it and I don't mind re-pairing it from time to time. Just wished I didn't have to do that but otherwise it's awesome.
Excellent delivery service, product arrived before expected, and the leash tape is a very bright, visible-in-evening yellow. However, unlike the product description states, the leash housing (what you hold onto) is not reflective, it's just silver and shiny. And unlike with my other Flexi leashes, this one has no 1-2ft. non-retractable extension hanging out; i.e. when your dog is standing next to you, this leash still \pulls,\ while other Flexi leashes have 1-2ft of limp leash that won't retract into the housing. That's a great thing because the leash goes slack (and doesn't pull on him or your hand/arm) when your dog is right next to you at a crosswalk or whatever.  Still, this is a great safety leash for evening walking. Just wish the housing itself was bright and reflective. I bought two of these leashes and I've received comments on them from passersby. Most importantly, at night cars can see that your dog is ON a leash.
The keyboard cover fits the keyboard perfectly and always keeps crumbs out. The cover itself is also great, could fit a little more snugly on top, but other than that it is good.
I must have gotten a good one. I bought it for myself to put it in my purse, but my awesome fianc&eacute; decided he needed it. He uses it a lot  and it still works great. I bought it about 4 months ago.
I received this from Influenster to try for free. I liked it but I did not love it. I does make your teeth somewhat whiter but it leaves a weird taste and feeling in my mouth. It is also a bit pricy. I would recommend it to friends, but I don't think I will buy any for myself, but I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste. So it could just be me.
My boyfriend ordered this for me as part of a costume to wear to the local renaissance festival, so I'm reviewing from his account. I'm about 5'9, 125 pounds, wear a size 2-4. The skirt came down to just brushing the tops of my sneakers when I tried it on, so it might be a bit long for women of average or short height. Even though the tag says one size fits all, it fit my hips without falling off or slipping, yet had enough stretch to it to comfortably fit the more full-figured ladies out there without any bothersome pinching, as other reviews have stated.  It was really comfortable and flowy, the brick red color looked great with the peasant blouse I wore, and the slip layer covered all of my assets, despite how sheer it looked in the photos. My only complaint being that the color bled A LOT when first washed and I am now the proud owner of 5 pink shirts and 12 pairs of pink socks.
Good book, but short. I read it in one day. Good plot and story line, would recommend if you like something different.
I have very fine hair and this is a great product that does not weight my hair down. LOVE IT
good story to help kid understand more about empathy. I give it 4 star because it is a bit wordy that kids can lose interest halfway through the book...but very good illustration and I would still recommend this book.
It was nice to get a logo hat for the price it was.Usually logo wear is very expensive.Nice quality too.
very good definitely a must buy, and thats enough to say, thats it, just buy it now, bye bye :)
It fits just right, just to wear with a thin tee below. I love pockets and the one it has a bit hidden in the waist is perfect. The colour is nice too.
It was okay i have no completes. I expected everything I bought. Took me only a about half an hour to finish on project. I bought this to build a 3D model for my science project and I could not be happier. I am I will be getting a 100 on that.
Deaver is always a good read. The story had me guessing all the way to the end. Next one please.
Took with CAMBOGIA and I lost 10 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks eating what I normally do. That gave me the push to cut out soda, then lost 10 more. Since seeing actual results I'm trying to eat healthier. Pills do not make you jittery or gassy/poopy
Love this game! Slow generating coins at first but when you get to higher levels it's not too bad. Was on level 100 then had to swap out my kindle and even after syncing I lost all my prizes and started at level 1! Really mad I spent money to get coins, don't think I'll do that again just incase I have another problem with my kindle.
I like this shirt it fits perfect and just tucking in the bottom a little makes it look so good!
My husband likes this product and has used it off and on for 30 years. He says that it is the only thing that makes his hair lay down without feeling greasy or stiff. He ran out recently (a little goes a long way) and we could not find it locally. So off to the internet we go.  After searching, we decided to buy it from Amazon.
I had a old Projector and many different devices with different output connectors.Now everything is plugged in :):0
Works as a great base layer or by itself, gets a little itchy when the weather turns warm.  Easy to clean, packs small.
For around $10 you can't go wrong with this case. The case has a nice feel to it. It does not feel cheap and is nice and grippy. The case has some soft stuff inside of it. This grips the phone really nicely and protects from scratches on the inside. The screen protector i was using at the time did not fit with this case so i did have to remove it. The reason i gave it 4/5 is because the cutout for the camera is a little large. Also the lock button is a little hard to access with this case. Other than that the cutouts for the buttons are perfect.
This book keeps you intrigue chapter after chapter. Always wondering what is going to happen in the next chapter; I really loved this one!!!!!!
EXTREMELY sheer. If you are looking for some sort of shield against sunlight this is not the curtain for you. It matched perfectly with what I was going for in my bedroom. Not the best material, it was a little frayed on some spots but nothing terribly noticeable.
I really loved reading this! It's a great girl meets boy novel full of lust, and moments of sadness. Madison met Liam and they were immediately attracted to each other and they later on find out that they work with each other! I got to hand it to Christina this was a very well written debut book, if there was any spelling or grammar errors I never caught them because I was too caught up in the book!Two people trying to make something of themselves In the medical field, and they find each other and know things will no longer be the same, they want a no strings attached relationship but that wasn't happening! I was on the verge of tears when Liam left, I was also so mad! He frustrated me at times! I really felt for Maddie. And i also wanted to kill Owen for doing what he did.Overall this was a great debut read and I am REALLY looking forward to seeing what's next for this great author!
The book came to my door and packaging was crisp or whatever. Book was solid and I could tell it was new, but the covers were not parallel to each other and the binding was bent. I'm a stickler for small things. The fix was easy but if the book were available in a store near me, I would've purchased it there.
Went for 34FF wear it as racerback is better for me than the normal way. more tight and help girls to not bounce as much.
it's beautiful! but it runs small a bit. half size up will be a better choice.unfortunately I cannot send it back. but really love the look!
These screen protectors are good if you want basic care of your screen. As in you just want it to keep your screen from having scratches and fingerprints. It isn't anything fancy, just a plain Jane screen protector. But it did fit well & if you know what your doing you shouldn't have bubbles. I would recommend this because of its price. It's well worth what you pay.
Very good product. I recommend it. Is you are looking for a mount this is a good alternative. Only bad: too heavy.
Good information.  This is a older book so it was a bit out of date, but all of the improtantion information is here and is very well done.
the kettle is fine, simple, the only problem i found: if you boiled water, poured it &#1097;&#1075;&#1077; and open the lid to add more, the steam can burn your hand - be careful.
A grain of salt must be taken with the no exercise part, however on the whole, a good and rewarding read.
I was excited about this...but when I got it, it was so tiny...I don't know what I thought it would be but it's tiny...It was delivered on time and packed great...
I would like to see this continue as a series. I'll watch anything with Gael Garcia Bernal in it. Interesting peek into life as a musician.
I love Affliction clothing, and this Konflict shirt is sort of a knock off of Affliction. Still looks great , price was great so I bought it. The size though is bigger than I expected. I think its made for big muscle guys with tiny waists lol.
I love these jeans!! They are a tad long but looks amazing around the waist and butt! When you walk in a room people cant help but to stare at these Jeans!
It was a slow meandering book. Kept me interested to the end...mainly because I wanted to know where this woman would end up. The author still needs to answer the question of why one of the dolls arm is shorter!
I have played a lot of mahjong games over the years, this one isn't the worst I have played. The graphics are nice and the fact that I can turn the music and noises off is a big bonus. But the game is glitch. In the middle of play it will stop n boot me. That doesn't endear this version enough to buy the full version. If that gets fixed it will be one to buy.
I enjoyed reading the depot. If you enjoy reading books that end on a cliff hanger, like a soap opera, then you will enjoy this book also. I personally do not like soaps. They are a waste of time. When I get the time to sit down and read a book I don't want to be angry with the author at the end of it. I choose short stories because they allow me to enjoy a little down time  without wondering when I will get a chance to finish a book. Unlike other prequels I have read this one actually leaves you feeling like some one stole your brownie after the first bite. Before you read this make sure she has published THe Library first.
I am looking forward to trying some of these recipes out. Unfortunately one of the best sounding recipes does not have ingredient list...the Bavarian mint...would love to try it. I didn't find many recipes I won't try in this book...except maybe the one recipe with no coffee added. I do recommend this book for anyone that likes coffee with a little spice. I will come back and update this review once I have tried a few
I find it interesting that the investigator in this vampire game looks like Keanu Reeves. When he talks, with that British voice, it throws me a little. I wouldn't say fixing things in the boiler room are adventurous, but maybe that's why I don't get paid the big bucks. I'm not very far into the game but so far I have no idea where it's going. So far the games seem pointless. But try the game for yourself. It's not the worst game I've ever played but I'm not sure if it'll make it to my faves list either.
Wasn't sure about this game at first, but I really enjoyed playing. The quilt pictures you are uncovering are beautiful. I recommend this app or others by GabySoft,  I haven't found one yet that didn't entertain me while I wasted time. The one thing I'd like to see included, and my reason for only four stars, is to give this app some type of penalty. You can just stumble along pushing buttons and still uncover the picture. I would also like to see an option of timing the puzzles, or something so that there is some way of showing you improvement in the game. But I would like these to be optional so that a kid can stumble along and uncover the pictures without penalty like the game is set up now.
I was amazed by a lot of the information I found in this book. I will actually reference this book in the future, which is not something I can say about a lot of books I have looked at over the years when looking for natural and preventative foods. I didn't give five stars because after only a couple pages I could tell the author is not a native English speaker. Some of the wording set the information of balance and I had to reread to try to figure out what author was trying to say. Not because of spelling errors either. I think Mrs Cooper did an amazing job. The book is full of great information, just please have the book proofread by an English speaking person. I would happily come back and update my review and give five stars.
It was very fast delivery ..my dog love it...thank you. I would order anytime again.looking fowards to look at more dog 49 ers
I like the color and durable quality of the cover's fabric.  It's not fancy but serves a practical purpose to keep a household applicance clean and secure.
The fabric is very soft. Appears to be well made. For this low price you can not go wrong. I like that it is reversible.
This was a really cute book and the story line was good. i think girls will enjoy the book! i read it in one day.
I like the tight fit ,my first waist cincher you can definitely see results the first time wearing it,the second day it was a lil looser,,I just ordered another one aswell,both in a large,..prompt delivery had the first one for a week now today 3-30-14 is my third day wearing it ,, the other one is scheduled to arrive 4-1-14 since it's by the same person it should be 4* too,the reason it's not 5* is because of the itchy feeling and marks it leave on you,,I keep it on for atleast 12hrs. as I go about my day.
Very good book. I love mythical mice relationship love stories.  These shifting stories are exciting. The author is very talented.
This is one of the best  books I have read in a while. The characters come fully to life and the story of their struggles in the harsh mountain logging camps kept my interest from the beginning. I look forward to more from this author.
Recorded in 2010, you'll find a few familiar rants and toons from his popular web series on this comedy album, but notably this fills in the gaps for the storyline of Germaine's nervous breakdown. I'm glad that JIM keeps it fresh by including Pillz-e and Begley (as I began to miss the squirrel punk Brit ex-pat- think Sid Vicious), in his never-ending NYC cultural/social commentary. He's ballsy as ever telling it like it is whether it's Germaine's weight gain, the state of education, or people walking around zombified from a cocktail of trends and antidepressants. Don't be afraid to DL this if you want to mirthlessly grin... or do be afraid.
Wasn't expecting much due to the low reviews but it's a pretty decent movie and worth watching if you're a sci-fi junkie :)
The screen protector is easy to put on and stays on well.  I wish that it was easier to clean because it is hard to wipe off the oils from your fingers
Works great could be a little lighter. An all blaze option would be nice. Shipped very fast received prior to promise
it work great just a pain if you have to take off for any reason fits like a glove thanks
the headset works great the sound is nice i love the color and you can use it for listening to your laptop, phone, or ipod it works the same with all and the sound is nice.
I really like this case it adds color and flavor. fits the phone nicely. Only down part is that it is hell to take off, so don't put it on unless you plan on leaving it on for a while.
Dose Leatherman make anything i that is not of good quality. This sheath is very nice, you can feel the quality. I use it to hold my skeletool. It is just slightly to big for that tool.
It's a fantastic product. It does everything it says it does, has a super easy to use interface, and adds new games regularly, (on average every 2-3 days). The only thing I'd like to see for this to earn 5 stars is PS1 game support and codes. Once that happens then this will be the perfect device to enhance a second playthrough or save you hours upon hours of annoying grinding.
Its recommended to use this safety can to keep potential fires from starting in your home or your work place.
John Waters midnight classic looks great on this dvd format. While I wait patiently for the Blu-ray (if they can even make one), I can enjoy some time with the filthiest people alive. The &#34;Shock Value&#34; of Pink Flamingos aside, the kitschy music, sets, and costumes are rolling on the floor funny. But be warned: If you are shocked easily, offended easily, or just down right closed minded, you should pass on this.
Delivered on time, well packaged and slip case only slightly worn. '67 DVD Set 4 Volumes 7 & 8. Vol 7: The 50,000 Breakfast, Dead Man's Treasure, You Have Just Been Murdered, Vol 8: The Positive-Negative Man, Murdersville, Mission Highly Improbable, Bonus episode: The Forget-Me-Not. Essential set for all Diana Rigg fans with the episode &#34;The-forget-me-knot&#34; where she leaves the series and Linda Thorsen as Tara King is introduced.
Great price for a big bottle of a classic masculine scent that is universally liked by most people. Being that the cologne is a spray makes it even more economical. It is rare to find a quality cologne like this in a store at the same price and quantity. I highly recommend getting this while price and availability last.
Light weight and easy to hang, these sconces are a welcome change from plain old pictures. I actually hung mine on either side of a framed picture and it completed the wall. Only drawback is the undersized candles they include that don't lie flat and centered in the glass holders. I am actually searching for replacement candles and/or glasses for it. It would be nice maybe if it was stained glass. Still, it was a good deal for the price and I am satisfied.
This unit performed well. No problem leaving it plugged in so far, although I unplug it when I leave the house because of the reviews I read, and indeed it even states in the instructions to unplug when not in use. The toast setting is sensitive, so it may be difficult to get very lightly toasted bread if that is what you like. I like my breads actually TOASTED, so setting it at the lightest it comes out perfect for me. Cleaning crumbs is easy with the pull out tray. All in all, it is more utilitarian than a standard toaster, as it bakes and broils foods as well. Except for the auto off for toasting cycles, there is no timer or auto off for baking or broiling. I just set my microwave timer.
There is nothing like a good &#34;who done it&#34; to while away a lazy afternoon. Of course there can be no comparison to one written by the estimable Agatha Christie and acted by the sublime David Suchet. Watching these mysteries in Blu-ray is icing for the little grey cells Mon Amie. Top that off with the beautiful art deco sets and period costumes, and all you want to do is kick back with a soothing cup of teasan and watch episode after episode. Highly recommended....enjoy !
Purchased for my daughter. She is 8 and wears a size 7......ordered medium .... I think is too small.......but she LOVES it! That's all that matters ! I recommend buying larger size. It's super soft and made well....would order again! next time just larger size. Fast shipping also !
saves you from having to replace lures, this retriever works so well it has paid for itself several times. it never leaves my tackle box and I take it every time I go fishing.
I loved Edwin's book True Haunting, so this wasn't much of a risk. The storie's were very clever. I enjoyed this book.
I bought this item about a month ago because I was in desperate need of installing an easy access light switch going into my garage. So far this item works great and was fairly easy to install if your handy with a drill and screwdriver to mount the switch on a wall. For me this item is only intended to be temporarily until I can find an electrician to hardwire and install better lighting. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to easily install a wall switch for lights or other electronics. I would have given this 5 stars but I'm not sure of the battery or long term life of this product though.
I originally bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my parents based on the most favorable reviews of any pillows I read. My parents totally loved them so I decided to purchase 2 more of them for myself. I have to admit that they these are not your typical idea of what you think a pillow would be. They are actually kind of heavy. After a few nights of getting used to them, I ended up really liking them. They are firm which I like in a pillow and they hold their shape really well. I find that I don't toss and turn nearly as much causing me to have a better nights sleep. In conclusion, I would recommend these pillows to anyone who is currently unhappy with their current pillows and willing to try something unconventional.
I really enjoyed watching this clean, family oriented movie. It was well done, Kelly my interest. I am a fan of historic fiction. Especially American history.
Jason Upton has a way of lifting you up, encouraging you, inspiring you. I love to worship to his music.
I like it. I like that I can either write, or type and can use it off line as well as on.
I've started the pan, but have been interrupted by illness. I think it sounds like it can work, but I still see the need for cardio activity more actively in the beginning for myself. I plan to continue with the book and hope to utilize all her suggestions.
Pretty cute. Very sexy and fit. I wear it in our party, fits my legs. I don't have single complain. Really its nice.
I really liked this product, it is easy installation and operation of its sound quality is very good and the image of the videos or movies is excellent, very good!!
Very entertaining.very funny. DVD came on time . Had no problems. I am enjoying my purchases. I have more to watch.
Received on time today. Will give five stars after a week of testing. Did come half charged.
This little purse is so cute in person but small. I use it for makeup/change. The otters are otterly-adorable and I carry it with me for quite store trips.
Very pretty but took way to long to get here. It is a nice green color, sparkly etc. This piece is big but not too big. It looks great in a mess of curled hair.
I love these, super cute! The heels is a little tight so I may need some cushion for back but besides that they are puurrfect!
Great ring for everyday use, but as a mechanic , my worry is it could get damaged or scratched, or dented so purchased a second tungsten ring for durability.
I enjoyed the story very  much, but felt like it ended too soon. I think she could have written more since it is a short book. I'd love to read how the story continued after the blessings. How did each grow after the baby came?It is an encouraging story of hope and of reaching out beyond yourself.Mrs. Patrick Welsh
This book is very helpful in my intro organic chem class. it is my go to reference for any question I might have.
Books is in good condition. The 4 star rating isn't due to amazon but the book is overall boring and not intriguing.
Powerful story. I loved the characters and the setting. I like how the book was set up in journal form.
The dialogue screens suck...Stellar battle system...Amazing character customization...Repetative... And dry gameplay...Although it's really good in small bursts.
The pants are perfect, I ordered an incorrect size but I decided to hand sew the hem to fix my exact size.
this was a text book for a university class so i needed it quickly and the book was in perfect condition and delivered extremely fast.one quality concern... a group of about 20-30 pages were not cut at the top properly so they were formed together almost as one thick page which i had to tear apart. i did not find it a big enough deal to complain or file anything as the seller was very exceptionalthank you!
This book was written by an author with a TON of experience on the subject. Lots of interesting tidbits of info on how air behaves as it passes through not only the engine, but through both the intake and exhaust systems. The book is a bit math heavy, so it's not written like a typical DIY engine book. It's more of a reference for those who are building engines on the professional level. If you skip most of the math (as I did), the book is pretty easy to read/understand.
These tapers are a good deal and a good quality. I ordered three sizes at a time and they sent me one of the wrong size, so I had to return all three and re-order. It was an inconvenience, but they corrected it with no problem.
At the start, this game appears to be not much of a challenge. But having played other similar games that start out with easy solutions, I expect that it will become more challenging at the higher stages. What keeps the game enjoyable is the panel of choices the player has for how he might need to use the tools he collects. An unexpected and creative spin on the usual escape the room games.
This is very good quality for a costume. I love how bright and durable the fabric is. My only complaint is that the measurements--as said in previous comments--are geared more toward men or women with longer torsos. I have longer legs and a short torso, and I'll likely need to either have it adjusted or tie it around my waist in a Portal 2 style rather than wearing it normally. It fits perfectly otherwise, or else I would return it and size down. All in all a very good product, but it's a risk if you're not sure on what size you might need.
These items got the job done. A couple of months after being used. They are starting to breakdown. I think they should last a little longer.
I've used this product before and had excellent results. However, it does not kill the adult fleas the bite and if there's an infestion, you'll have to use several applications and other products to finally get rid of all the fleas.
I've used the product before with excellent results. This time it is taking longer than normal. Maybe I don't have enough roaches and am not putting enough out. It worked wonderfully when I used it at my father's apartment before he passed away. He was so sick that he couldn't clean his apartment and the roaches were out of control. When I came into town the first weekend and used the product, It killed about 75% of the roaches. Of course we cleaned the apartment which also helped. The next weekend about 90% of the roaches were gone. My mom loves the product and my second mom love the product. (I have to get it for everyone).
Good read. First a bit slow to get into, but the last half is an enjoy and interesting, twisting and turning read.
This Jambu sandal is a good option for those who need support or have difficulty with backless sandals. The base cups your heel so no slipage and the straps keep you from pronating also.The toe box is a little cramped if you need to add orhtodics.  Without orthodicts it is sufficient.
Is silly comedy, most unlikely to happen, like the cast, Katherine did a great job!!! will recomend to adults only.
Good quality and I received the wig fairly quick after purchasing
Ok, It's a great knife... except my tip was a bit bent when i received it. Also, I hate how it's so uneasily flipped into/out of position. Could have been designed better, but for under $10 it's a good knife.
It's been anywhere from 1.5 to 2.5 weeks now since I planted five. Two of them have sprouted, one of which already has two leaves.
I believe this is a pretty good crochet book.I have not tried any of the items to crochet but it looks fine.
I love this bag it is really cute, i dont really like the orange inside but i knew that is how it came and that is my personal opinion. I gave it 4 stars because i wish it came with more pockets. It has no pockets on the outside and the ones on the inside are really tiny. I ended up using this bag as my new diaper bag lol!
I love this case. It is great and works well with protecting my kindle. It doesn't look cheap and the leather feels great in your hands. Now it won't let you close it and charge it and it sucks to read with it on because it's awkward but you figure out what works good for you.
This is one of the dictionaries that is compatible with Office Suite Pro 6. It also happenes to be the most comprehensive of the offerings, with over 160,000 entries. If you get OSP6, then this is the perfect dictionary to have(you'll probably never see those annoying little red lines while typing again).
I love the product but it came in 3 separate bottles (equalling the 24 oz). Was looking for the pump top, but it ended up working out fine
It warms of the room real well, I would reccomend it. The only bad thing about it is that the fan speed one and two are the same it doesn't change but it is not really needed.
I have been taking this for a month now and slowly I am noticing a drop in my weight. I plan to start a work out regiment too and will update after that to see if this accelerates weight loss even more.
It was a captivating book in my opinion and it was my type of love story, and as it was expected everything ended alright.
This is one of my husbands favorite holiday movies.Great chemistry between the couple and a good family movie to watch some evening.
Love the protection with this. Having to get use to opening phone to text. GREAT that you can anwser phone and look at time when closed. Could be a little more economical.  Almost ordered wrong one cause video played for one with no cover so not sure whats up with that. Why show a video of one cover on link that is not the same cover?
they are wonderful my son was so excited! he LOVES Thomas. but they are pretty cheaply made. already coming apart at the seam when we opened them.. and the material seems like it will rip easy.. but they get my little one excited and ready for bed time so that's a big plus, but probably wont last very long. (however we have lots of Thomas clothes ((winter hats, gloves, and blankets)) and they all seem like they are cheaply made and come apart at the seems within days..) so I wasn't expecting much better quality, just sew it back myself and it stays together.. so that's why I still give it 4 starts cause I purchased only because Thomas was on them. they look better in person then in the picture and the blue one is nice and fuzzy and warm, the green one is thin so better for warmer nights.
These things are pretty good if you need a replacement cap. They do the job. Not sure how durable they are, but it's pretty hard to break lens caps anyways.
I liked how straight forward it was as well as how accurate the information is. I strongly recommend this for business or for personal relationships
I don't love the chocolate one as much but the peanut butter is so good! Great way to cut calories in a smoothie
I enjoyed seeing Tim's motivation was indeed based on love.  Previously he came across more as selfish and just wanting Ben for his own sake.  Maturity allowed him to appreciate Ben's relationship with Jace so much better, since he had a similar one with Eric.
I'm hoping this is the first in a series!  There is just enough angst to make the characters interesting and the love scenes leave you wanting more!
This is a sweet short story about a boy looking for love and another boy unsure it even exists.  Enjoy.
This is a beautifully written piece set during a time in America so many lost everything.  Whit was able to pull himself together by helping so many others 'down on their luck.'
How many times do our dreams have a hint of reality to them?  This could very well be a portent of things to come!
I like my purchase because it matches a shirt I wear while playing golf and it is the correct size for me
I bought this to put on my home network.  I have several computers with a variety of operating systems.  OS X, Linux, and Windows all work well with it.  If I had to do it again, I would.
This short book outlines the life of Herbert Grings, missionary to both Africa and South America.  Grings was definitely a bit eccentric, but effective.  What is most impressive is the number of missionaries who have come from his family, now in the fourth generation.  Matthew Champlin, who helped rewrite the book, is himself a 4th generation missionary from Grings.Robert. D. Patton, M.D., D.d.
This book is a very positive addition to those on the life of Brainerd.  I found the original diary very difficult to finish.  It seemed like page after page of fasting, prayer, and sickness.  However, this book helps me greatly to put things into a chronological sequence and make the entries much more meaningful.  I would recommend it.Robert D. Patton
Good movie showing the &#34;passion&#34; or ending side of christ only showing basically his trial and crucifixion. But it does show in actuality how they would beat someone and persecute back in those days.
Good ole nozzle with plastic covering over the handle, has brass fittings in the end and guts. I think and hope it lasts a long time. It does have a warranty for life.
Bought this to put in my air compressor and some flat tire repair tools, everything fits good and this bag is built tough for the job!
Accurate little thermometer, have not tried it out in the freezer yet but no doubt it will work there as well.
Has little jaws that come in and grab jar lid once tightened down, then the leverage of the handle gives you grip to take lids off. Not sure how this will help elderly as they need both a stationary base and something to take top off but this works good.
Perfect for properly disposing of lancents. Plastic container like you see in hospitals or doctors office, the lid it comes with hanging off is when you get ready to seal it up when it's full.
For the price and non-stick properties these are great to use. Probably will get some good long use out of these.
Overall for the price given its a nice little set of everything you need for personal manicure or pedicure. Good little travel kit
It's a good halogen bulb that gives a bright white appearance almost matching HID. I've used these for years over the yellowish phillips bulbs that come default. These fit the fogs on a 2012 hyundai sonata with no issues.
It suds up good, i used this in an attached sprayer bottle on my hose and it foamed up good spraying it out. Noticed after rinsing it immediately started beading water off which is a good sign. Only time will tell on how long it will last. As far as cleaning power it does fairly good, but i've seen better. Then again it is trying to do two jobs in one. The best cleaning of a car is in steps, but for an all in one cleaner and wax i think this outperforms most.
Bought for my dad to wear out and about, he really likes the khaki color as it blends with anything.
These have good adhesive on the back and work well on any application from a car to a computer. The chrome coating has lasted many car washes so far, and if ever it wears out later then it is easily removed.
Its ok, could have a little louder ring as my hard hearing mother could not quite hear the ring well. Although the clarity of the phone is really good. I love how when someone calls it tells you who is calling. overall worth the price from Amazon.
Nice shirt and fits well. Good thick quality cotton and overall colors and design are nice. Threads are done good too.
It is hard to find these anymore around the hardware stores, with the metal backing and descent cardboard surroundings. Nowadays more people are buying the restrictive pollen catching filters that end up doing more damage than good.
Great size for making fondue etc. I used for melting chocolate for dipping peanut butter balls and found setting on low side about 3 to 4 dots up worked best. Use oil in bottom when melting chocolate morsels so not to scorch or etc. Stainless cleans up very good, i was sad to see it was not dishwasher safe and recommended hand washing but that was no big deal. Came with the 4 dipping spears with different colors on the end.
Going to be  christmas gift, for the price i expected cheap plastic or something. But its a good metal with pretty little design that reflects light all over it. Going to make a good little gift
It's a nice little stuffed bear but the picture looks slightly darker brown that what actually the bear is. Also the frame is not wood but vinyl. I noticed some loose bear hair at first picking it up and running my hands through. Overall still a good gift for the price
good rechargable 9v batteries, lasts a good long time before needing recharged again. Use them in metal detectors, magnetic levitation devices and other household items.
Very light weight shoes.  Comfortable walking shoes and east to care for too.  The elastic shoestrings make them easy off/easy on.
This sprayer arrived without a bottom plug but the problem was promptly resolved by a phone call to the manufacturer.
these run true to size and wash well.  Very comfortable to sit and lounge in.  Warm enough to wear on the coldest days.
It was not for me, but i think that my girlfriend like it, and we didn't have to go walmart.
Thought it was a great read, kept me interested the whole way though it, didn't expect the way it ended
I was expecting a bit more weight to these sheets but the color was great.Over all for the price not bad.! I would buy them again.
these aren't as soft as i expected. will probably soften in wash. doesn't have a normal hem like the ones i purchased in a store.
the colors aren't the same as in the picture and they aren't as long.
I really enjoyed reading this series. i can not wait to read more about snow white i give this 5 star rating
Excellent great raping paper in all the bottles arrive in great conditions.Love every one of them thank you so much..
It looks really good. They are the perfect size and looks just like the picture. It arrived rather quickly also
my computer would not load it as it said there was too much risk to have it put on my machine
Really nice gear and will work perfectly on my trip to Belize. This set was missing a small piece that connects the mask to the snorkel but Amazon and I came to an agreement that was satisfactory to both parties.
Good read can't wait for the next 100 books. I will be waiting to buy each one of them. thank you
Too cute! I really like it ! Nice and affordable! Stylish girlie and the look is in!!  Love love love love this
I love this strope!  Works well.  The only problem was of its length as well as its mislead picture.  The length just makes it a little more a hassle where you would have to repeat the runs on strope a few more times.  The two seperate stropes you see on the picture is actually one strope.  Overall, been using straight razors for a while and can honestly say this is a great buy!
Well written and creative! Loved the story for the most part.The characters are strong, especially Beatrice. Her thoughts and feelings are strong and the interaction she has with the others works well throughout. The story really drew me in. Seeing the different factions and how different they were and how they interacted was really interesting. How Beatrice overcame obstacles and progressed through the story made me want to keep reading more and more.The story is fast paced, the action intense and keeps you involved.Parts where I think the story could've been better were the character development. I think it was good, but it could've been a lot better in my opinion. I didn't connect with the main character as much as I would've liked to. Not that it was bad, because the character was really good, I just think it could've been better.The ending was okay. The emotions seemed off at the end. I felt it was a bit rushed. That was really the only time in the book when I wasn't connecting with the characters. The ending was left hanging for the next book.  If you're looking for a book that sums up completely, this isn't it. There will probably be a few more on the way. But it's definitely worth it.(Possible Spoilers)I think some parts came too easy to her, like the Capture the Flag game. I felt like it could've been more of a struggle and it would've felt like the victory was more of an achievement. The interactions between her and Four was good, but sometimes I felt like it was lacking. Also I felt like security in the area should've been better. It was far too easy for some of the more evil characters to commit violent acts against each other and get away with it.Overall I loved the book and would recommend it. Not book of the year but very good.
i like this product and i really enjoyed it and its good to read my favorite books and i would reccomend it to other
Perfect size for the space needed. It has met my expectations . The price was great and so is the lamp.
Presidential  dollar coin collection  book find and as expected.  Ad says includes free DVD.  did not receive.  Papers with product says must send for the free DVD and pay another shipping / handling / processing fee.  this is not right.  again ad says free DVd  It should have been included with product.
If you're looking for revolutionary gameplay, this is not the game for you however, it does have an interesting story as well as good music by Bowie with him as a character in the game.  It came in on time and works perfectly.  Very interesting story and a good edition to the Dreamcast collection
Its super helpful to have these if you don't want your ears pierced, but you gotta be mindful that they do irritate the ears a tad bit because of the magnet, and do fall out quicker than an earring with a stud.
GOOD PRODUCT, I USE TO FINANCIAL MATHEMATICS AND IS VERY PRACTICAL.Would lack (,) FOR ZERO ELSE BUT THIS WELL.
OK I THINK THAT THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST THING I EVER BUY, SINCE I WAS A CHILDREN SO JH
Laurel is now in senior year at Del Norte High School. Despite all that happened, she tries to live a normal life. But when Tamani enrols as an exchange student at her school, all becomes even more complicated.In my review of Spells, I was starting to dislike Laurel, I don't know if I'm the only one? Things got worse in this book. It's a pity because it's the only negative thing I have to say about the book, this book was a lot about Laurel's relationship with the two men, I didn't mind it and I loved Tamani as always.I can understand that it's hard to choose between two people you have interest in, but she's bringing it to the next level. Poor David and Tamani! And yeah, she's still acting careless even after what happened in Spells and what Jamison told her. She never learns of her previous mistakes I guess.I loved that some chapters were from Tamani's perspective. I think it made me even more in love with him then before. Laurel must choose him, I'm team Tamani even more then before!But the end&#8230; I want to read the last book now! For the first time in the series, there's a real cliffhanger at the end. I love cliffhangers even if they can be frustrating, especially if the book is not out yet. Luckily, this one is. And I will be reading it soon!
I absolutely love these shoes I ordered them in red  they look expensive but They are definitely not . I can wear them with pretty much anything I want . Runs True to size, very flat.
Three knives at this price, nobody is expecting a high-end performance.  For the price they look nice and fun for throwing at soft targets.  Probably smart to throw over carpet v a hard tile or concrete surface.  Don't plan on using these for a street fight, they're only slightly better than screaming for help.
Strong female characters that are put in their place by hot men. The relationships seemed a bit rushed but a well written plot. Wish it was a longer read.
i love the color and size. i will recommend this item to all of my family and i pick that rating because the item is good.
it is romantic and creative, although the author has potential for better stories, and sweep the readers off their feet.
its pretty awesome. its not just the concept but the way the story has been written. i just couldn't put the book down till i finished it :)
I got these as a gift for a friend of mine. She loved them and wears them constantly. She has not described how comfortable they are, however when I was packaging them to give to her, the material felt soft and stretchable.
This collection of six horror stories is entertaining. Turkish Night is a surreal and violent story about belly dancing competitors. Never Leave Me stars a possessive husband and a ghost, with an interesting twist to the ending that I really liked. In The Painted Staircase, a troublemaker on a museum tour gets more than he bargains for. The Colour of Dishonor is a chillingly different kind of historical horror story with a cruelly dishonorable character who finds himself haunted by his sins. I Dived the Pandora is a scary story about a wreck dive gone terribly wrong. Enjoyable collection.
When I purchased the inverter there were many other options to go with but I am glad I went with Sunforce. It is performing great and came when expected. I'll order another before I go with a different company.
This game is super addicting! If you like flappy bird you'll like this too! It is so much fun! I' d recommend it.
This is a cute movie, sad that people burn each other people like that though in that profession. all in all thought, we love Zac Efron and can't see him doing a bad movie.
The boots look sturdy enough, altough i have to try them in the field, maybe i will go hunting this weekend.They are also pretty comfortable, i just walked a couple miles today with them and i have no sore feet. Also they arrived sooner than i thought, thats a big plus.
I ordered this phone case for my older brother, and he likes it.the item looks exacltly like a picture shown.
i love this. great neutral tones. only downside is that some of the colors don't blend as well as the others.
Overall amazing product. Took a few extra days to get here. Looks great and the cover went on easy! only thing that was a problem was that the sticker on the screen protector would not come on off so i have glue smear on my screen
Loved the product...great seller...highly recommended !!! This book is a good starting point for those who wants to learn more regarding engine management.
I received my case and keyboard cover. I was looking for a deal on both together, and I thought this looked like a good product. Be aware, the case is not crystal clear. There is a frost like quality or opacity to it. The keyboard cover is silver, not clear. However, I do like the silver keyboard, because it blends in nicely with the aluminum of the computer, and gives it a retro feel. Typing will take a bit of getting used to, but it is a good fit. The case fits nice as well, I just wish it was a little more see through. Another note on the keyboard cover- the power button key is painted with the eject symbol, leading me to believe that its for the Macbook Pro, but, again, to me its not a deal breaker. I am very happy with my purchase, and saved a good amount of money over buying a case and keyboard cover in a store.
I found this book heart warming.  The martyr was truly put through the wringer.  The enemies he made, the friends he found during his hiding, his intelligence all lead to a great story.
Very interesting advice well worth reading and help full in site to the American tax system if one has retired to the US
When I search strings like \statement command\ it finds the phrase(4 cases exactly). However, the highlighted phrases are a few word off-focused. That is, in the following text snippet,'The Show Next Statement commmand...'\Show Next\ is high-lighted instead \Statement command\. In this case, two words are off-focused.Additionally, quite a few graphic titles like \Run to cursor\, \Step Over\ are hard to recognize.Lastly, I felt a couple of pages are missing although I don't remember exactly where they are.As a overall judgement, I don't regret buying this book. I'm reading this book on my Android smart-phone, too.Take care,
Liked the Marriage Merger but loved the Marriage Bargain.  Great reading.  All 4 were fabulous reading - interesting story lines
Well done Katie.  Another great one.  Loved the books about Aidan and Emma.  Loved their story  A real romantic's favourite
These rose petals could not have been a better price. They don't look 100% real, but they also don't look super cheap like some of the others I have looked into. If you are on a budget, then get these. they were perfect for my occasion. The best part is when your done you can reuse them and they do not stain like real petals would.
This is the second time I have ordered screen protectors from this company. Both times I got super fast shipping. I was not supposed to get my product for another two days, but I got it early both times.Now time to review this particular screen protector, It seems like good quality, However, It does not grant as much privacy as a similar tech armor screen protector. Downfall for this screen protector is that it isnt as private as the tech armor one. Good thing though, is you get 3 screen protectors for around $5. But the Tech armor privacy screen protector was $8 for a pack of one!I would have given 5 stars, but it just isnt as private as other ones.

Blocks noise perfectly, priced better than the local store. fit very well my mic. Awesome! Great for an amateur, just like me
A lovely quick read that is  quite comical if you don't mind corny British humor. Written in play format, easily imaginable.
First of all I was under the impression that Pink Zebra products could not be sold on Amazon? The sprinkles melt well, but the warmers or \simmer pots\ as they call them do not last well. Since Jan of 13 I have had 4 burn out and 2 lightbulbs go out in 6 separate warmers.. The company is a hassle to deal with. UGH I recommend to stick with the store brands.. Smell just as good without the hassle..
These are great at canceling noise. It is so much easier for me to study and work out now because I don't hear everything that is going on around me.
These are great but sizing feels one size smaller than listed. Would have definitely kept them if they had fit.
I read this after I watched the movie.  It is an entertaining book and was not as graphic as the movie which was a good thing.
This coffee is great for persons that like good coffee it works great in the 1cup maker.I had problems with the plastic type
I didn't mention in my previous review that the Microsoft Step By Step books come with a CD. There are practice files to load and exercises that give the user practical help in learning to use the programs. I have not yet seen the 2007 PowerPoint book. But I expect it to be of the same quality.
Very nice figures for Beatles fans. They are for decorative purposes, though, not to play with them (very limited articulated movements).
The controler is not an original but it works fine n my kid likd it!! I would buy another one if I ever need it...
For the reasonable price, they definitely fill my need, with no concern if I lose one.Would surely purchase again.Very good.
Have used it for many years. No after affects. Works great.This item is no longer available locally. Glad I could still get it on line.
This protector was what I expected.-No glare-Has a smooth feel to it-Shipping was fast-Instructions included-Fits perfectlyI am really happy with this item so far.Only negative is that I do have a few bubbles at the top right corner. I didnt get it on perfectly straight so maybe the next one will be better.Justin
I got this on a black friday offer... Just 200usd, and well... The price was just right haha. Sometimes it gets a little slower when I want to watch a movie online... But other than that it is great for school. The only think I truly hated was Windows 8... I went back to Windows 7 and it works just fine ;)
The Julian Chapter was a great sequel to Wonder. It was nice to hear Julian's point of view. It made me respect Julian more. I chose a four because I wanted Julian to become friends with Auggie. If that would have happened, I would have gave the book a five.
I just got the product in the mail yesterday and  immediately put it to use. I have a pair of high heel shoes that are just too snug by the toes and this overnight in one shoe has made a difference!
This book sounded like a real person. Was not too descriptive considering the title but was by no means dry!
Basically what I said in the title. You can make some shots with the same motion three times in a row. But on the next set it goes way wide on a simple passing shot. But it doesn't ruin the game. Good graphics. Good gameplay
The book is entertaining,as  are all of James Patterson's mysteries. It is more along the lines of the Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drew series. I would probably have given it 5 stars back when I was a kid and reading murder mysteries. It is great for kids.
Sometimes it dribbles a little water, but otherwise I love this product. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, but it ended up also being a gift to myself. I use it all the time when I need to quickly rid my clothes of wrinkles before work or going out. It heats up super quickly and really gets the job done.I've found it works best when I lay my clothes flat on a bed and use it like an iron.
it was a little smaller than normal mediums but it stil fit. i wear a small in real life but on amazon i always order a medium because most items do come too small.
No different than the ones a 3ds comes with, other than the color on the ends. They stretch out to the same length and fit nicely inside the console's socket.
It's not a bad case for the price but it has the look more of a binder than a tablet case, oh and the card holders on the otherside will fit a business card and not a drivers license or credit card.
As long as its under 40$ it's a good deal and a overall warm and appealing fleece, would by again, in a different color but not for anymore than 40.00$
I was a big fan of Power Rangers in the late 90s-early 00s, and I never had the original MMPR Megazord. Thankfully, this rerelease fills that void. Although not a perfect recreation of the 90s toy, it still has a vintage feel. Parts are of high-quality plastic and diecast. My only complaint is the sticker sheet. The actual stickers are placed about a half-inch to the right of the patterns (most likely a manufacturing error, and hopefully an isolated incident). Overall, this is a must-have for fans of the show from way back when!
I bought 2 of those books and they are awesome but they were stick together with a big sticker and I haven't succeed to take it away completely without damaging the cover of the product.
I have been using a small cross over sling purse for over 8 yrs and it still looks the same..Very practical with little babies around.
It was the usual Belinda Alexandra, I cant put down book. I had to keep reading to see what happened next. I have read all her novels released here and can't wait for the next. My favourite was Golden Earrings.
Searcy's book, &#34;Connect&#34; is a good book and I really enjoyed it, for the simple reason it enabled me to start thinking through how to create and implement systems in our church. What I like about it is that its very practical. While not everything translates to our context, I always make sure I look for principles of connection not programs. And very often with Searcy, what you see is simply common sense put to print helping us remove much of the fear of recruiting and implementing volunteers.
I would like to say Thank you but I NEVER RECEIVED THE MEMORY I JUST OPEN THE BOX I FIND ONLY THE CAMARA & BACK PACK if I dont write before is because I was away so I come back last night then I opened the box I find only 2 thinghs so I would like to know what happen now
Great quality decal. I wish that it was less frustrating to pull apart and get the decal on the clear side but other than that it serves it's purpose.
I've started using it for just a few weeks and starting feeling that.my knee is getting better. Hope it gets even better.
I would reccomend this product to anyone with an I phone for protection. The otter box is by far the best product I have seen. And why would you pay 50 dollars at best buy when on amazon with shipping is only 20
Obviously an awesome show. I adore it. Amazon let me download it quickly and hassle free but the quality isn't the greatest. It isn't bad though.
I really enjoyed the book, it was hard for me to believe that could really happen.  But, what if it could?  God can do all things.  It is just hard to wrap my mind around, but it is great reading.
My boys love Richard Scarry. They have many of his books and several of his videos. This one is meh. Not terrible, but certainly not the best out there. I would recommend sticking to his &#34;Best Ever&#34; series.
works well...does have a slight unusual smell and a bit oily, but works well and will keep it for that! only 2 weeks  used on my thin hair-- hope to see some changes
Happy i tried and use this product, works well, user freindly..smells OK and will continue to purchase-use it ! again..
Nice to know, you have the protection-service to replace/repair your hard earned money on your purchases (electronics) glad i have it!
All worth the cost/price for this amplified speaker ( as so many to choose from..) i went with this model/type to fit my budget and not waste my money, well.. it was a good choice.. user frendly-Loud enough for my use.. (classroom) and backyard (gatherings) i plug and play my CD player and mic-up to have some fun...
very satisfied with purchase and delivery time, looks good- works as expected and love the shrink wrap/ covered handles. Busts a good sweat/workout for entire body.
This is a great system, I really like it. Here's my review about it.Note: I didn't purchase this on Amazon but this is the exact system that I bought so I decided to write a review about it here.This system comes with the DVR, four cameras, four 60ft power+video siamese cables, a mouse, the power supply (power brick) for DVR, and a single power supply with a 4-way splitter for all of the cameras.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 1: The DVRThe DVR is great. It's nice and clean looking. The user interface looks crappy but I didn't pay much for it so I don't expect a pretty UI on it. It's also not that intuitive/user-friendly but I'm pretty familiar with it now . It was much easier than I thought it would be to install the hard drive. The screws on the DVR cover weren't even on it yet (they were in a bag with the hard drive screws) which made it easier to install the hard drive since I didn't have to unscrew each screw on the hard drive first. It came with the screws for the hard drive as well as the hard drive cover. I got a 500GB \white label\ hard drive for $45 on another site and it's working great.The DVR has motion detection recording which is really nice. You can set it to continuously record or to only record when it detects motion. You can also set it up to send you an email when it detects motion and attach a picture of the motion it detected.- - - - - - - -EDIT: I have now successfully set up the networking stuff. It didn't take me too long, and I followed Zmodo's tutorial but I have experience with networking so it was pretty easy. You just have to open a few ports on your router. I can view my cameras anywhere on my iPhone as well as from any computer (that has Internet Explorer - ugh, I know... but it requires ActiveX to work). I couldn't get the email notification to work though - it just wouldn't work. I would've constantly been getting emails anyway though since the motion detection recording is triggered all the time.- - - - - - - -The DVR has 8 BNC video inputs, 2 BNC outputs, 4 RCA audio inputs, 2 USB inputs (one for mouse and one for flash drive to back up files), 1 ethernet input, 1 VGA output (for monitor), and the power input.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 2: The CamerasThis system comes with 4 cameras but the DVR is 8 channel so I have the ability to extend it if I need to add more cameras. The cameras were a little bigger than I expected them to be, but they're not too big. A couple years ago I got a couple of Lorex cameras from Radio Shack, and they're a bit smaller than these Zmodo cameras; I was expecting the Zmodo cameras to be as small as the Lorex ones. They do have more IR lights (night vision) on them though. The Lorex cameras that I previously had have microphones built in to them but the Zmodo cameras do NOT have microphones. I'm using the Lorex camera for the front door (so I have audio) but you can buy this small microphone to attach to one or more of the Zmodo security cameras for audio:VideoSecu High Sensitive Audio Pickup Device External Amplified Tiny Spy Microphone for CCTV Security Camera with Bonus Warning Decal WD6You'll have to purchase a cord that has the audio though too (they're available here on Amazon - 100ft video+audio+power cable for around $10).The cameras come with brackets and the mounting screws. It's kind of difficult to get it just right but I haven't had issues with the mounting brackets like others have had - they didn't break and I tightened it pretty good. Also, the camera colors are pretty accurate. I noticed some people have said that the camera colors aren't accurate but mine are pretty accurate.The night vision isn't that great, but it's better than just a black screen. You can see more than shadows but still not enough to identify someone. Lights that are outside your house make the night vision better though.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Overall, I am very happy with this system. I got a nice 8 channel DVR with 4 cameras for a great deal.PLEASE NOTE: This system does not come with a hard drive installed in the DVR, you have to buy it separately. You can still view the cameras without the hard drive but you won't be able to record anything without it.
Not exactly what I expected but what I wanted.  It was introspective but was not a cutsie book about a dog and his person.  It was a nice read and I got a nice feel of climbing the White Mountains.  Some good family thoughtfulness.  I enjoyed it.
THE HEADPHONES WERE EVERYTHING I HOPED THEY WOULD BE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN BUYING AN AID FOR HEARING YOUR TV MORE CLEARLY.
Everything was great as far as fast service, price, etc. The only problem I had was that the color is mire maroon and not pink like in the picture. Wish I'd of known. My daughter loves pink so I hope she still likes this one.
I loved the story...the only thing I did not love about it was how they separated it into 6 volumns just to get you to pay 2.97 for what was just a book
Moves a little slow for advancement but over all a pretty good game, interesting to see what will come next. Can hardly wait to get to add a new section.
Purchased this as a place for my toddler to hang his things, and for that purpose it is perfect. However, I'd think twice before hanging anything too heavy on it. It's cute, and a great knockoff in comparison to it's higher-priced predecessor from Eames. My only real complaint is that the screws it came with are of extremely poor quality, and with one twist of the screwdriver, they stripped. Purchase yourself some decent hardware for hanging.
its a decent story, well structured.  Going to read the rest of the series next.  I imagine that this book really just sets the stage for the rest.
Overall I'm pretty happy with this coat. Past reviewers commented that the wool was scratchy, or low quality. Yes, it's scratchy, but not terrible. To be honest, when compared to other wool items that I have, it is pretty smooth. It has a smooth felted feel to it, which is perhaps why past reviewers didn't like it? (It isn't fuzzy soft, or lambswool - it's more like a &#34;motor coat&#34; kind of wool.) The quality is about what I expected for the price. The wool isn't super thick, which I appreciate, so the &#34;skirt&#34; of the coat drapes fairly well. It's warm, windproof, probably not the coat I'd want for sub-zero temperatures, but great for cool brisk November days in Oregon. I liked the studded sleeves better than I expected, they stand out more on the actual coat than they do in the photo, and they add a nice feminine touch. I love the gray color.  Now for the less than ideal... it's not quite as structured as I thought it would be, and it bunches up a little around the waist. The arms could be a little longer but I always have trouble getting coats with long enough arms. I'm 5'8 and ordered the small, but wonder if I should have gotten the extra small - the shoulders fit, but as I mentioned there is a little bunching of some extra fabric around the waist. That seems to always be the trade-off- enough room in the shoulders, or a nice tailored look around the middle. When all is said and done, this coat is a little bulkier than it looks in the photo, but I still like it. I'm keeping it, and in the few times I've worn it, I've gotten a lot of compliments.
I prefer the electronic copy because the paper copy has never arrived before the start of the period. The January copy was due in December as at 14Mar13 has not arrived. I will recomend that all subscribers at Our Lady of the Pines Donvale us this method.
Not what I was expecting.  The five charging cords don't work. Happy with the camo phone case. And happy with screen protectors.
This radio is great. I work in a mechanics shop where it's constantly loud but you can still hear the radio over everything. It's light weight and all functions work well. Clear sound as well.
These gauges are pretty cool but would look better if I had a bigger size. The trim on the outside makes it kin of hard to tell what the design is in the middle. They are well crafted though.
This bracelet is sweet. Like one of the other reviews said,you do have a hard time fitting the pin in the holes but after some use its no problem.
Sometimes it's nice to read the books regardless of weather you've seen the movie or not. The changes can be interesting in going from written word to script
It was a nice read. I think I just get tired of &#34;series&#34; books. Whatever happened to just writing a novel? To me it's getting to the point where it's an underhanded way for writers to get more money.
Has some awesome music. Just think that as a whole, My Kinda Party was a better album.  Maybe it will grow on me!
the product was exactly what i was expecting, you could see and feel the high quality the instant you remove it from the packaging. Although one remark I would have is how it is very easy to dirty which some might see as a good thing as the leather ages and gives the case a different feel.p.s. it fit the iPad 3 perfectly
My Son loves  for me  reading to reading his to him at bed time. It has become our bed time routine.
I like this word game, sometimes I get a lot of letters that I can't use then I get frustrated, but overall this is a good game
HI  I would reccommend this book to any one who needs help with their daily lives,  and any help would be perfect.
Never read this author before.  Would read this author again.  Kept the story interesting as well as the interaction of the characters.  Very satisfied with the book.  B
i have used it a couple of times.  It gives me something to do when riding with my husband.  A good past time when you don't feel like reading.  I also like the challenge of being timed.  Good fun.  Bea
easy to use and when you have doc in a higher version of word it easily converts it for you.
The story thoroughly pulled me in. After a while I barely noticed the editing errors. Looking forward to the next books.
It works well with my laptop and the sound quality is awesome. My only problem with it is that the headphones are not adjustable.
I like the Creed family members, always have and very likely always will.  Linda Lael Miller can be depended on for a good story.
When I received this case I was so excited it fit my kindle very well but the quality is.  Little low well I guess you get what your pay for .
This is about zombies. It took a little bit to get used to zombies being called ghosts even though the explanation was clear.  This story drug me in and glued me to the pages. . It seemed too short and I am ready for the next .
i got this for my moms pond and she seems good with it
bought it for a friend
its so cute i got it for my nephew
everything came and it all fits a good lil kit to start off with
Well built and strong. Great for street use and racing with vintage cleats. Competitively priced at my best go to-Amazon.com
It's too bad so many people try clipless these days. These give you a choice between street shoes or racing cleats with the same pedal.
I liked it it was an game and I hope that they create more levels for this amazing game and it was a fun experience to play this game
It's a lot better than the other temple run and the graphics are the best. There are better upgrades and power ups in this one I recommend this for everyone. The only thing that I don't like is that there are demon monkeys.
I found that this book reminded me of why I believe in God. It also helped me to put known truths into perspective and strengthened my faith that God is sovereign and in control. Nothing takes Him by surprise and He is God alone.
This is the cheapest place to get this product by far :) I decided to try this product to help with my dogs fatty tumors, at the advice of my friend. Gave him 1oz per day. After several weeks, the tumors started to shrink! There was a significant reduction in size. They went from a softball size to around golfball size. Then after a cpl months, the tumors started to grow back. :(  They returned to their original size. I may try the gel in addition to the neutralizer and see if that helps. It was very amazing how they shrunk, even if only for a while.
Really like two of the books the other I had a little trouble getting into but was worth the price
I didn't find it as memorable as Ashley's other books but still had the Kristen Ashley magic to it. Was kinda disappointed in the story line as it seemed to go nowhere.
Haven't heard how they work since it was a gift.  However, she is into yoga and said she was looking forward to using them the next time she goes to work out.
I love big nate books because they draw a smile on you're face and this one just made me crack up. Can't wait to read another one :-)
Awesome product.Very bright light, excellent magnets and fast delivery.I would defiantly recommend. Bought it for my mechanic boyfriend who always works on his truck in the dark. Hangs inside hood.
Enjoyed the book very much. Actually liked the rambling from different eras. The memories of my youth came back. Neil has always fascinated me and I have a better understanding why. Highly recommend for the rock and rollers among us.
Good DVD quality tho.  Gotta have the whole series so don't miss this one.  Still stars the original Angela!  It's a spookbash!
This purse is super cute! I want another one in a different color. 2 things I dont like about it but its not that big of a deal. The straps are short when I put it on my shoulder the top of the purse rubs under my arm and its very floppy. It doesn't hold its shape when I put it down it just lays flat other then that I love it!!
I liked the book but it starts a little slow but got better as it went on. I will read the next one just to see where this goes. Can't wait.
Still reading but so far it is very interesting, very well written, keeps you reading. It is a very good book buy I am only half way through it.
The book was good I wish it had been a little bit longer. But it was still good to read.
I think this book was better than the last one. Can't wait till the next one. Keep up the good work.
I picked up this book and I just think it was great. If it had been a little bit longer that would havebeen great.
Worth buying. Not crystal clear, but has a humble and low-key gloss. Hope it will prove to be endurable as time goes by.
My daughter loved this costume and so did everyone else. Would recommend to any little girl who wants to dress up like perry.
Anyone buying this item should know it is not as long as the original cord but it is an excellent purchase and it arrived sooner than promised.
liked it but was shutliked it but was surprised when it ended so abruptly.  I expected more .  like  Alex cross series.
The Sylvania light is bright on all three settings and I am very pleased with it's performance.  I would order it again.
I have not read the free preview.  I would rather wait and get the full book on Kindle when it becomes available.
Could of had more info on operation. Otherwise it's terrific. Watch is a nice size,not too big nor tooSmall. You can't appreciate the watch until you actually have it in your hands. Would recommendIt to friends and family.
Girlfriend really seemed to like this product, it's very easy to put on and stays in place great. Highly recommended!
Not for the overly sensitive. If you get offended then don't bother. If you enjoy a good laugh, do it!! So super funny. I totally enjoyed it. My only issue is that it's short. But hey it's a kid book...hahaha!
Another great book by the king. Only 3.5 stars in that this is typical king. I hold his bar a little higher. Very good book. Reminds me of dollens Cadillac.
I did my daughters hair in a twist out after washing and her hair was dry after 30 mintues, very happy with purchaes
I really like this...its simple easy and its still compact enough with it being a wallet so that I can keep my cards and stuff in it if need be. One little thing...is that its not quite as snug around my iphone as i thought it would be. But it still holds it nicely! Its not a case for everyday use...in my life at least...i use it when making quick trips to the store...or going out to dinner or something with friends. Worth the price and i would buy it again :)
This book had me from the beginning, I just couldn't put it down until I finished it, so that means I stayed up all night until finished.
Works well except after a rain.  Then it works after it dries out a bit. That's all I have to say.
Mostly enjoyable hidden object game where you earn coins to purchase other items to furnish a room.  Don't like the rooms where you have to unscramble the clues to find what you are looking for, or the rooms where you are shown just a silhouette to find the object.
Drop in replacement that works as expected.  Easy to install and hookup and runs very quiet.  I hope it lasts as long as the original did.
Smells like fruit.  Mostly coconut.  I like it! a little goes a long way: 1 bottle per gallon.  Next time I&#699;ll try strawberry!
It works...but for some reason it seems like it&#699;s not quite as &#34;billowy&#34; or as &#34;full&#34; as regular fog juice.  I bought this to try it out, and see the difference.  It&#699;s not bad.  But it&#699;s not great either.  Don&#699;t get me wrong...I&#699;m not unhappy at all.  Just giving my review in comparison to a regular juice. I&#699;m not really sure what the ECO is, I haven&#699;t looked it up yet, but if it&#699;s a good product that&#699;s good for the environment...it&#699;s good for me.  I&#699;m going to research what the ECO part of it is, and then make another review.BUT...I&#699;d buy it again, especially if it&#699;s good for the environment.
This fits the Trailmaster Limited perfectly.  I live in Hawaii so I need a cover that is medium to heavy duty, that will keep rain (and in turn...RUST) off my smoker.  I&#699;ve seen a number of YouTube videos of smokers that are totally rusted from being left out in the rain.  If you have a Trailmaster Limited, it fits perfectly and it&#699;s priced right.  The Amazon price was actially less than it is at my local Home Depot.  No tax and free shipping.  Can&#699;t go wrong there.
Ok, so this is the 3rd one I&#699;ve purchased. I own one, and I&#699;ve given two as gifts.Here&#699;s my take... bass is nothing to write home about.  However, this unit is MUCH better than my phone speaker, so when listening to music on my phone...THIS little oontz is better than what I have.  Does it match the sound quality of a Bose or JamBox?  C&#699;mon... let&#699;s be real.  NO.  But then again, I didn&#699;t spend $200 bucks on it either!  And it&#699;s inexpensive enough, that I bought THREE of them, two to give away.  And the teenagers who have the other two...LOVE IT!The one negative I have is that I don&#699;t believe it actually lasts 10 hours on ONE charge. (I think it says that on the manual I got, but I may be mistaken)  I think it&#699;s more like 6-8 hours. Still though... It&#699;s worth $39 bucks.  If you want something that&#699;s better than your iPhone or Android phone speaker... Get this, and buy with confidence.  If you want better bass, and fuller sound reproduction...then buy the Bose.  For me... $39 bucks for something I can throw in my bag and go to the beach with...or give 2 away as gifts...PERFECT!Update:One odd thing... so these two didn&#699;t come with the little carrying bag.  Not a deal breaker, but my nephews both said the bag wasn&#699;t in the box.  Mine came with a nice little felt bag that you&#699;re able to carry all of the cables in, but theirs didn&#699;t.  Like I said, not that big of an issue, if mine hadn&#699;t come with one, they wouldn&#699;t have even noticed but since it did... they brought it up.
Chris has a great voice and I hope that he keeps making good music .I would recomend this to people that like good muisc.
I like TV that is interesting and keeps you guessing.I would recomend this program. Hope it gets good ratings.
it is good for this price. maybe I am too thin, the costume is too short and fat for me. But I am still very happy when wearing it. and that is enough :)
Awesome thing to have for trips or even if you are just in an area where there is no outlet or charger. The one bad thing is that you have to take you cover off to charge phone because of the large output port
Not pretty but does the job of keeping the glare off so I can see the screen.
Thank you.  This is a &#34;short and to the point&#34; learning Dutch! It did help me a lot and now I know the basics!!
It does it job. Afterall, it is simple bar stock with lapping compound. Have seen same kit in a decent plastic case after purchase. That would have been preferred....
It was so exciting. Absolutely stunned by the drama. I could not stop reading it was addictive.Well, James Cavendish is addictive!
i liked the plot, couldn't stop reading it. Wasn't as unreal as other similar books, although it had certain similarities with 50 shades.
Not bad, very vicious little blade. Came with a few small stains on the blade, which may or may not be a CRKT issue. Doubtful it had to do with the seller. Sheath is a little hard to assemble, and not the best design. I do like the knife though, but not quite what I had hoped for. Still, excellent sharpness and the full tang is nice. Very lite weight also.
Good knife, just way too big for a pocket knife. The handle is HUGE. LAWKS system is solid; definitely no play in the blade. Good knife overall, but not good for pocket carry. Came with extra clip, which is always nice. For 20 bucks, not a bad buy. Ill keep it in my truck.
This is my 8th Invicta watch, Very nice Watch to use for business or casual attire. Love the design and classy look! Worth every penny,
I cant complain because I have worn this every evening since its arrival. However I think I should note that it is not as soft as expected and the color was very very off. I ordered the rust color and it is pictured a very nice dark rusty color. The robe I got was more of a light rust (looked like it had been washed 100 times or more like a primrose. Despite this I really do love and will not return it. The quality is great and I feel I will have it for years to come
I got this for a cheap and easy way to heat up water while camping with my kids. I didnt put much faith in it because of the price. It did take quite a while to ship but at this price you can not beat it. I have not used it very hard yet, thats why i am giving it 4 stars, will update it after some serious use. Case is flimsy, but what can you expect?
Put this on my Mosin M44, it leaves a small gap between the grip and the stock but its tolerable, especially for the money. Easy install, it helps to drill a small pilot hole and to use a screwdriver, dont use a power tool or you can strip out the hole or crack your stock.
I liked the information given on why we should or should not consume certain fats, etc.  Dr. Wythe not only gave reasons about topics he also went into detail.  That was my most favorite part of his book.  It would have been nice if the charts were in the book rather than have to go online to retrieve them--that is the only thing I did not like about his book--not having the charts to refer to as I read the book.  I am trying some of the recommendations and menus given--bot not all.  Furthermore, I would recommend this book to anyone intereseted in knowing what they should and should not do to lose weight.
I really enjoyed this book. It seemed a little bit short. I would recommend this book to everyone. I would have like it to be longer. It had an abrupt ending.
One of the most sweet books I've ever read and I hope more to come from the author. Great job.
At first I didn't think that this would be as accurate as it said. It just seemed like a fun little app but all the times I've used it its been pretty accurate. =)
It was my first time getting one and i have to say it works wonderfully its helping me with my drawings majorly
like it, worth what i payed for. i digged the color too went along well with my black electric violin.
I purchased these to clean my stainless steel drinking straws.  The smallest fits tightly enough to wash the regular drinking straws and the widest ones fit well enough to clean my wide plastic smoothie straws.  They don't feel super sturdy as the metal bends some, but my stainless steel drinking straws are bent and it aids in cleaning around the curve.  I figure they'll last at least a year if not longer if I'm careful and are definitely worth the purchase.
Sound so good an look real pretty sitting next to my other instruments. I wrote a song with my guitar and added the bongos to jazz it up and its perfect
While the book is compellingly entertaining from the start to the finish. It never really hits home on the issues it raises at the beginning. A disillusioned corporate sellout taking on the powers behind the world's biggest conspiracies should deliver so much more than this short piece did.Nonetheless, if youre after a strange, hilariously entertaining and at points depraved quickie, Eggman is your man.
So... good vampires, bad vampires, soulmates, witches,... Haven't heard that before... I expected it to be bad, honestly. It didn't seem all that original with the vampire-loves-human-thing, but I am so glad that this book wasn't what I expected for once. Because this was a really good book. Wait... What am I saying? It's not good. Not at all. IT'S AWESOME!Yeah you saw that right. This is an awesome book. And you know what? It actually turned out to be pretty damn original. I love the vampires in this book and the whole soulmate-thing. Throw in a witch and your settled for a good time reading this book. The writing is also great. I mean, seriously. Ashley has a way with words and when I read this book she kept me guessing until the end. I loved the mysteries and unanswered questions that hooked me to the story. Good job Ashley!I love Amelia. She's awesome. Yeah, she had a hard life and she had a lot to deal with but she's also a stubborn, strong young woman and she doesn't like to be controlled. (Unlike some other characters in vampire-books... *cough*) She fights the bond even though it may hurt her and I like that about her. And in the end, she learns why her life was as s***ty as it was. So yeah, great main character: CHECK!Of course I loved Mitchel and Angelle and Eric and Luke and... All of them. The good guys were great and the bad guys were great. It's all great. Awesome awesome fantastic!I will read the next books in the series as soon as I've finished the other R2R-books, ARC's,... that are screaming at me from my TBR-mountain. (Yes mountain. Not a list, not a pile, a mountain.) \Shut up! I'll read you as soon as I can, okay? Yeesh...\ Books these days...
Have you ever been cheated or tricked? Have you ever put so much trust in somebody but eventually it turned out that he/she lied to you? Do you like the feeling of being fooled? I believe you don't!This book is about lies. Before I started to read it I couldn't think that it's possible to write whole book on such topic, but I found out that there are many more books about lies. That surprised me in the beginning, but getting deeper into the pages I realized that it's really a very wide and important topic in our lives. I thought that I never lie, but it turned out that I do, just mostly all of my lies fall into the category of acceptable lies. You will find many interesting information like classification of lies and liars, the accuracy of polygraph, biggest lies in history and many more.There are things that I liked and disliked in this book. The good thing about reading Paul's book is that I really learned a lot of new things and information. Before reading it I just knew that people lie, now I know a lot more about psychology and science of lie. Yes, you can really call it science! I don't mean that I learned everything written in the book, but I can see a bigger picture on this topic now. Another thing that I liked is examples about real historical events. They really made reading more interesting. One more thing that I paid attention to is that author don't claim things, he just says his opinion, results of the experiments and facts beside. That makes it more real, than just to know someone's opinion and take it for absolute truth.What I missed in this book is more pictures of human expressions with different emotions. There are some, but I think it would be more interesting to see more emotions and more different people feeling the same emotion. Reading this book felt like it is more adapted to catch criminals lying. I've missed more examples and information on business lies.I understand, this book is dedicated to see the big image on lie topic. It's not a learning tutorial. So probably my dislikes are not very countable. Anyway, it's a great book on quite an interesting topic. If you are interested in body language, mentalism or seeking the truth, you should read this book.What's your opinion on lying?
It's sick.It's creepy.It's disgusting.It's unethical.It's psycho.It's mentally ill.It's pervert.All of these epithets might suit to describe this book. I think some people might not even read it fully.The author, Chuck Palahniuk, can really write intriguing and creepy plots for the stories. I'm not too much into novel, but as I liked \Fight Club\, written by the same author, I decided to read this book as well. I can say, Chuck really surprised me with this book. I didn't expect it to be so sick. Of course it depends on the attitude, of how sick you see it, but even for me thinking to have a wide attitude, the story was pervert. And I don't mean pervert in a sexual way, I mean pervert in mind way.The story basically concentrates on few young people having everything in their lives. What I liked the most, that the author shows what is happening in their heads, but this is fully revealed only in the end of the book. One of the main quotes of the book is: \Everything we want is what we are trained to want\. And only reading this book fully you can see to what sick thoughts, actions and consequences it could a damaged mind bring to.If you think you can imagine all freaky-pervert show, you should really read this one!
You have to serve for the people - people who buy your products, people who work with you, people who you work for. Howard Behar is the man who made Starbucks the biggest coffee shops network in the world and now he shares his knowledge and experience with us.There is nothing much new or different from any other business success literature in this book. Howard shares his life journey while developing Starbucks into the biggest coffee chain in the world. He shares ten principles, which made his fortune. All those principles are pretty much the same as many successful people have. What I found different in this book is that Howard writes it from the perspective of people. Mostly he concentrates on all the people who make the business like customers, colleagues and employees. Author points out how important it is to listen to people around and act on other people's needs.It's Not About the Coffee made me to start looking more deep into people, analyze what they want and find a way to help them in what they need. It was a good reminder of the success principles as well, and mostly it helped me to realize how important people around you are. The book showed me that it's people who do the business. It's important to have a good product, but it's also very important to have and develop good team.
It could use a stronger hanger and a better way to hold the hanger in place. If you have very heavy jewelry or a ton of it, might not be a good choice.
We have 3 girls in one bedroom and affording 3 matching bedding sets can be a daunting financial task!  However, these were extremely reasonable, and look very cute in the girls room.  No problems with them although they are not the very highest quality.  They are really great for the price.
First space heater I've ever owned.  But it does everything as advertised.  We have corner storage room that is very drafty - this knocks the chill off in 15 minutes.
I wish it could be shipped faster. Because what have we need it right away. So i think you should work on that
When i got this product i was trying some of them to charge my device and all of a sudden the orange one did not work so i hope u can work on this product.
Great mouse for web browsing, not too fond of side scrolling mouse features. Great for most internet and pc gaming, any other general laptop tasks. I have small hands, this works great for me. Only major flaw, after a couple months of use... the scroll wheel becomes loose. Doesnt really affect anything unless you like to rest your finger there (gaming) then it tends to wobble up and down. Great scroll capabilities, dont really need a mousepad for it. Minimal crevices for gunk to get into. Reciever neatly tucks into battery compartment.
this case is sooo cute! i love it so much. if you like protecting cases though, this isnt for you. i gave it a four star because when i got it the lace was already kind of peeling off. it will be fine though because i will just switch it out alot so i have it longer :)
It works well to get rid of dry skin.  I would buy it again.  It is worth the money. Thanks.
Grim story like the book.  I enjoyed the film very much.  Peter Jackson and the rest of the production crew did a fine job again.  Can't wait to see the death of smug.
So much better than my old phone. So far I am loving this phone. I just wish there were better accessories available for it.
Don't get me wrong, I really love Black Veil Brides. The music was fantastic on this album. The extra songs were worth it. But as far as the Legion of Black video goes, I was very disappointed.It's just one long music video.No dialogue at all besides the dialogue that comes in the songs already.The story was hard to follow. It's not even a story really.If you want the extra songs, just buy them online. It's not worth your money to buy the video.
Having bought this buggy as an entry level product with a view to getting back in to buggy racing then it was just what I was after. You can run it virtually stock in many clubs and this means it's down to your driving as to whether you win. It's great flying over jumps and better than the slash in this respect. However, you are well advised to buy the wheelie bar as under full throttle it wheelies virtually every time, which you may think is fun, and it is to start with but when you fire the power down hard coming out of a tight turn then it's just what you don't want. They are around $11-12 on amazon and are what I would class as an essential purchase. Buying a set of bearings will help increase the speed and more importantly the run time, and I'd recommend fitting a set as your second upgrade. Both of these are normally accepted mods but if you are planning on going racing check your clubs class rules.Battery life? 8-12 mins with the standard battery and then 8 hours for a recharge is not much fun, so budget for a larger capacity Nimh battery and a fast charger, the first will increase your run time, the second will charge it back up in around 45 mins, much more fun for you and /or your kids.You can even fit a Lipo 2S but will need a matching charger, combined this could cost you $150+. I would therefore suggest a 5000Mah Nimh on amazon at under $50 and a fast charger at $30-40 will be a much better bet for most people. You can purchase an 8 cell hump pack which will also increase the Rustlers top speed to over 40mph with the extra gear fitted. Note though that to fit an 8 cell pack you will need to fit the 'Battery expander pack' - a bargain at under $6.I would therefore say the rustler gives great fun in the back yard or on the racetrack at a very low price, but budget for an extra battery, fast charger and wheelie bar as they are all essential. The bearings are a good 'nice to have' option.
I learned a few new things. Like the one about swiping keys to type. Pretty amazing! I think it was pretty helpful for beginners. Thanks for writing the book.
like this. it works well for your appointment and note to remember to ask when you go.not a bad device to use.
I just received this awesome decal! I also received two practice stickers as well.I had a gift card and decided to splurge!The instructions were clear, however the decal did not easily adhere to my MacBook Air.I had to use an ID card while peeling off the paper so it would stick.Now that it is on I love it!
I thought these pair of earrings would be adorable to put up in your cartilage. I thought they were going to be a little bigger than what they are. They are pretty little, but I still think they are cute.
I love this single. Love Is Only A Feeling is one of my favorite Darkness songs. But it took soooo long to get here haha.
Daniel Mason is a character that leaves you conflicted between feelings of sympathy, shock and pity. Campbell weaves a gripping tale that draws you in for more as you feel you are right there with the protagonist soaking in the sights and sounds, experiencing the frantic energy of the streets, enjoying time spent with lovers and living as a foreigner both fascinated and alienated by new surroundings.An original story with many layers, Typhoon Season leaves you breathless and revaulating everyday sensory experiences.
I like it very much and for the price yes please. I can change it every time I need a new one.
Nice shoes they fit nice, at the beginning a lil tight but then they start adjusting to your feet form. I like them a lot l have it a four star bc the heel is ok not great I would've be perfect if the heel had a stronger support.
My grandson noticed that there was no white ball on the end of Santa's hat. Attention to detail! That kid notices everything.
A different take on crosswords and jumbles, it is something that I am enjoying while waiting for the bus or plane
The 5:2 Diet cookbook is a very wise choice for someone who is always busy. I hate diets because they never work, that&#8217;s why I loved how this cookbook explained to me what a diet is supposed to be. After reading that I was eager and ready to learn. This cookbook provides very delicious recipes that can be made effortlessly. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s ideal for someone who is always busy. Anyone can prefect these meals. This diet plan takes dedication and commitment. You defiantly have to stick with it to see results.
This cook book drew me in because it gives extensive details about diets. Most cook books only give you recipes but this cook book explains to you what a diet really is. It also teaches you about diseases that being overweight can cause. It taught me what foods were good and bad for me. It also taught me how to save money with this new diet. This was really helpful to me. The recipes in this book were very easy to make.
Being able to charge my Kindle without a USB port is just what I needed. I am happy that Amazon made it so easy to get this item.
\After the Cure\ seemed like a totally different story from \The Cure\ - different characters, different place with a thread of the first story in it.  I never even found out who was in the hooded robe in the closing scene of the last book. Isn't that what sequels are for? To continue the original story and explain? The grammar and punctuation weren't very good either. I really think they need a new editor, or at least a proofreader!
Not much people can really pin point what really happen during reincarnation (by memory at least), however this book showed a unique approach. Whether it's true or not, the plots of the characters here give me some fresh points of view. It triggers some questions within me, what if that's what happens in this real world ? Each different plots were presented in such a natural way, gloomy or happy ending. The gloomy ones left me feeling relieved, that such tragedy in the character was finally ended. The good ones left me with the soothing feeling, that kept me going through all the circle of the chapters.
It's a good portable device and you can easily carry it with the case given. It have a decent design and battery life. But have less supported apps.
This purse was a birthday gift from my husband he may my day I totally love it the color the quality of it and the space I highly recommend it if you like big purses!
I put it on left it on till it was all dry.Then got into the shower and washed it off with warm water after I towel dried my skin was so smooth.You can tell it washed away old dead skin cells.It's great!  Thank You Debbie
They are good but fall off after like 4 hours, so don't were them to somewere you are at all day.
The wig was pretty good it fit descent and looks pretty close to the real hair I would recommend it .
its been about 2 weeks now and my tf700t is doing good with the new armorsuit.  The application process is a bit scary cuz u gotta put all this liquid on your tablet before applying the screen protector.  oh and you gotta wait 24 hrs to use the tablet after application wtf is that i gotta wait 24 hrs to see if all this liquid didnt kill my tablet??? nah son!!!  its cool i guess cuz you can take it off and re apply it and it does look good after a few days of setting in. but liquid and tech dont mix and for that it looses a star. if you want to buy this youll be happy with it after the scary process of applying it.
Sent as a belated Christmas present to adult son and he loves it!  Maybe I'll get my own some day!?
I enjoyed this boxed set very much. The only thing I dislike about any book is narration. I like to hear and feel what the characters have to say or are feeling,I other than that I really enjoyed the change if pace from other romanc books...this series had scandal death and so on in it. Another favorite author!!
Love the feel of the fret board right up to the sound-hole.  This is my first acoustic guitar. Love the color. Finally have a guitar of my own.  It's a Takamine classic.  Thanks
Only using the IR usb dongle for HTPC machine.  Have it programmed in a universal remote and works great,  Does what I needed it to do!
this is a ok Sim game not that far in to it but I see myself loseing a lot of time to it
I really enjoyed reading this book but the Ira chapters in the middle of the story were difficult to read through.  The love Luke has for Sophia is darling and overall, I hope this story is a movie some day :)
The tank fits as expected . I dont have a flat tummy and im short so I bought a large . It doesn't fit too snug . The XL  would have been a much lower cut .
The toy is great, but there is no place to store the cards. If they would make the plastic part just a little bigger, then you could store the cards and the buttons inside so nothing gets lost and the cards don't get bent.
I purchased this drug book to help with clinicals. The main thing i don't like is the set up of it. Some of the drugs that are still on the market are not even in here either. Overall, I do like it and it has been very helpful for clincals and researching drugs.
It is bigger than I thought it would be.  Love the bangle bracelet style, fashionable with easy to read dial.  Matches any outfit.
These shoes were my favorite shoes until I lost one shoe to a muddy swamp! Great shoes for anyone you're feet will love you for buying them!
A large type of music in this album. Singer's voice song's like C. Bennington from linkin park. Sometimes accoustic, folk, alternative, hard rock or Nu Metal, but always on it.AS what I think they deserved to be more popular.
This phone freezes up too much. Didn't come with an SD Card. Unable to look at some youtube videos that are on Facebook.
Only &#34;bad&#34; thing is this shirt is so much attention! So many looks hahahaa but that's why you get it q:More purple than I thought it'd have...
This is great to start with the thread is in good quantity,  But the scissors are hard to work with.
-- we are reading it together as a church. However some editions have the Book of Job  a little further back than on the tablet version..
Fast, able to handle gaming and engineering solid models. I purchased this on my newest PC build with intent for high end gaming with occasional SolidWorks use in Nov 2012.Pros:1. Easy install2. Looks awesome (my PC has a clear section on the case. These help the \why is that not in outer space\ impressive appearance)3. Very fast4. Never been able to max it out yet (even with highly graphics modded Skyrim.)5. Still expandable to 32 if your running extensive video and higher level Windows 7 or 8Cons:1. Still a bit price heavy, but I got them Black Friday so no issue for me.
I love the gold heart dangle earrings. I was disappointed in the packaging. The fine gold chain on one of the earrings was in a knot. I tried  to untangle the chain, but I could' not untangle the chain, so I wear one shorter than the other.
This bag is perfect for my many travels this summer with my little toddler! I search online tillI found this bag; the size is great and its very stylish. However, there it is labeled as &#34;CA prop 65.&#34;I've never purchased anything with this label. The state of California has proved that this productcontains chemicals that cause cancer and fertility issues along with birth defects. Being that I am 7 weekspregnant and plan to use this purse daily, I've decided to return it. Other than that It was perfect for me.Makes me wonder what else should or has this label on it?
This is a good replacement for the DirecTv remote at less than half the price.  Easy to program once you get the hang of it and if you have any questions, Eric is awesome!
This is a great book to get your juices flowing and it is a great read! Enjoy it alone or with a partner!
shipped on time. very excited to give as a gift because our son really wanted this. our son is a ningago fan
I enjoyed the variety of characters, and the natural progression of the story.Kept me entertained from start to finish.
its really a big help,with this little bottle.It can even stick hair pieces to a sweaty bald cap.non problem whatsoever removing it.
I read reviews and thought that this product can without added salt or sugar. I was mistaken. I'm not super picky about that- but I know it is very important to those more health conscience than I.Other than that, it tastes GREAT! came super quick and their is no extra floating oil- very well mixed and very smooth & creamy.
I dyed over already blue fading hair. Turned out more of a dark blue/purple than just dark purple but still very pretty and color is holding fast! Thank you!
I wasn't sure what to make of this book at first. It started a little slow but the storyline quickly developed and the characters emerged  and soon I couldn't stop reading...I just had to know what was  going to happen next:)
I love the descriptions of the destinations.  Can't wait to have a few road trips this year.  Some are practically in my back yard!
It really keeps things hot!  Indispensible for those large groups we have for breakfast during the summer.  Just remember to release the lever before tipping it back down to avoid the drip down the side.
These plugs are definetly lighter than the pic but none the less extremely beautiful! They might run a bit small but great quality and super fast shipping.
My husband likes the pants.  Sometimes in the stores it is hard to find the 29 length.  This was an easy way to get him the pants he likes.
Great game!the pace is incredible! The food get burnt easily though! Pout! I'm glad the money doesn't disappear like some game I know!
Satisfied in its aspects , but its memory is not that much good...browsing with pointer is diffcalt and slow,that is not ok
i just got this light today in the mail. its very bright which i thought it wasnt going to be so thats a plus. it seems heavy duty, i bought am extention cord ahead of time and im glad i did cause the cord it coiled very tight and probably wont reach very far. other than that only time will tell. ill give an update soon once i have been on a few jobs with it and once it rains heavy on it and everything. the only reason i put 4 stars is because when its plugged in and you turn your car on it automatically turns on to the first of 7 unique patterns so you have to push the button 7 times to turn it off. other than that its a great buy so far. i know it will light up the area at night because of how bright it is in the day time. bye for now.
The reflective tape was exactly what I was looking to make minor alterations to the shimmer of my lures, excellent
