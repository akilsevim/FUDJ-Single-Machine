Very mobile product. Efficient. Easy to use; however product needs a varmint guard. Critters are able to gorge themselves without a guard.
Cute
The case feels a bit cheap but overall it's a nice case. A but hard to use when a call comes in but if you usually use headsets it won't be a problem.
Very funny show. Look forward to watching more. My family enjoyed the show as well. I love when they the show president. So funny and cute.
Some dont close well. But you get what you pay for. They can do better than this material I think.
The case is ok except for the slight smell coming from the case that I fear could be somewhat toxic.
This product was very well made and will last forever but it just doesn't work as a belt clip.Damages dress belts with minimum useNot secure on wide beltsScreen faces out so it is exposed to possible damage and nosy peopleI am very impressed with all the other products from this company but they need to put more through into a belt clip design.
It is good for me to recharge the battery in my cell phone Maybe it works in other cell phone but not mine
The terminals were bent or broken on both batteries when received. I do not believe this was caused in shipping
I like it very much and i recommended to some of my m7 friends but after a month i using it i found out the soft rubber on the edge of my screen is starting to peeled off, i hope the production line will aware about this issue and improved their quality control in the future thank you..
My wife and I both agreed that the best actor in this film was the dog. Having said that, he was an exceptionally gifted dog actor, so it's swings and roundabouts.Plus points: The action sequences are brilliant. Really good, and have much better pacing than in the book where they are somewhat ponderous and muddy in the detail. Also, some of the more laborious bits of the book are left out, so when it does eventually get going (after about the first 70 minutes), it's pretty good.Minus points: The lead guy is a muchness. The lead guy's dad/guardian is cold and unlikeable, pretty much binning the character from the book. The woman playing number six has something of a \Mid-Pacific\ accent, veering between Australia and the US on a sentence-to-sentence carousel of linguistic wonderment. The whole of the first hour is pretty dull. I was going to say terrifyingly dull, but that romanticises it somewhat - it's just dull.But there is enough going on to keep you interested. Don't read the book first though - I guarantee you'll be disappointed.
The boots are absolutely beautiful.  I bought a size 8M (my true size), and the zipper wouldn't go up all the way....I have other boots no problem....thought ok, I'll try an 8W  still no luck, this is definitely for a SMALL calf....boohoo...
I was kind of disappointed with this card stock.  It is not as smooth as the Neenah Super Smooth White card stock and you can't blend alcohol markers as well, but it works just fine for digi stamps using colored pencils.
I haven't washed it yet but the fabric looks like those which get smaller looks better than feels, the fabric looks cheap.
the earphone is suck!!! not louder at all!!! but the bass is okay for the price and i am not okay with this earphone...
The dress is of good quality. We like it very much. Good thing my daughter is 10months and small so she can use it now. Despite the size issues, its a great deal! Thanks
This book started slowly but I  couldn't put it down for the last couple or three chapters. I was not too surprised by the end though.
Never finished the book, when I bought it I thought it was the next book in the series. I only got half way through, and I was very bored when reading it. I guess it was my bad for buying it under false pretenses.
Its ok, not much of a choc kinda freak. Not my cup of tea really.  Might be asking the wrong person.
I really liked the neckalce, but you could not read the writing on the heart. I had to find a magnifying glass on christmas just to read it to my mom. Other than that it was a nice.
However, I only got it in March and the AC  adapgter has since stopped working, I need a replacement one. My 15 year old is driving me nuts without it.
I choose this book by accident but once I started reading I became hooked I love family and when they came together I was happy
loving this game cant wait to unlock more rooms i didnt think it would be so much fun i would recomend it to friends keep up the good worka
I LOVE my weight lifting gloves: they really have a grip. Everyone @ the gym ask me we're did I get them from....Also LOVE the color&amp;#128517;
This case was good for at least a month before the accessories had begun to fall off! Cheap. Cheap. Cheap
This book is one of my least favorites in this series so far. I love that it continues to fallow the other couples as there stories continue to unfold, however I felt as though this book was to short. There is getting to be detail after detail in the story lines of the numerous couples that needs to be told, i felt as tho grit and his masters story didn't get the details it deserves. I am not sure if that was due to moving things along or trying to shorten thing so the book didn't get to long ? I personal would have preferred the extra pages and details. I was just getting into grit and his master's story when this book came to an end, I am ready for stix to release to see what happens next!
Author had knowledge of New York City, antiques, people of privilege, and especially drugs.  There were brilliant descriptions and heartfelt emotions.  There was too much truth in the book -- the unrequited love and life is short imparts a feeling of hopelessness.  The fact that art endures seems to be the whole point of writing the book.  If you have nothing important to do, read it.  I found it to be a sad story with a sad ending and far too many words.
I love it only thing I have to say that sucks about it is that the little magnets throw off the pen, other then that it's great
Need to add stickers for access areas not covered by case for better blending of colors. My phone is red and it really stands out against the black background of the case. Howeverr I really do love the design and it holds on nicely.
This keyboard protector is a simplistic covering keeping the keys clean, but the right hand side does not sit properly over the keys. This causes the right side to lift; it seems a few millimeters too wide to fit correctly.
This aquarium is sweet. I love the lights it makes your room glow. My only problem was the filter it came with is not very good. It doesn't keep the tank very clean. I would suggest getting something different if you want more than 5 fish. I found I was taking the water out and cleaning the entire tank every 2 weeks because of the build up algae and fish flakes the fish didn't eat. That's actually bad because your fish will be stressed from changing they're environment all the time. Most of the fish actually died Also do not put those claw frogs in there either, the tank won't be able to keep up with the mess they leave at all. I tried even putting a different pump in there but it just will not work because of the shape of the tank. I think if you want to buy this tank it has to be for looks only. To be able to maintain the aquarium and keep the fish healthy I suggest only having 3 very small fish.
Because of the pics on the cover and the description I thought this book would be good for younger kids. This book is not. This book would be enhanced with descriptive pics so a kid would know where in the body the author is describing. Facts are fine but they are not going to keep a child's attention long enough to learn them.
so so...kind of over rated lol.  It didn't come out as clean as I wanted to at the end and alcohol scratched it up.
I could not put it down! The book was good but the only thing I will say is I think Rene fell in love to fast!
I was caught up in the story from the beginning, and sadly thinking  such a scenario or outcome is truly possible.
Tool does exactly as advertized but crankshaft really doesn't need held the only way it can be turned or moved is by hand.
Better than the movie. A must read excellent characters. I enjoyed every page. Leo Tolstoy is a great writer. Recommend this book to any one
It stains like crazy! But it leaves a really rich color. It also washes off a lot as you shower which sucks a lot!
The item is great but the one thing I didnt like from cable matters that they keep on getting on my nerf
I don't have personal experience with it, but received no complaints, and the person I gifted said she liked it. It does make a nice, quick, and thoughtful gift for teen girls when you need something.
These are OK.  The way they are packaged causes some of them to not lay flat which sometimes makes them appear cheap looking, but this probably cannot be avoided without more costly packaging.  That is my only negative comment.  They are good for what they're used for - disposable.
This one was a little too hard core for me. It was okay. I didn' like the cheating and the was he treated her most of the time.
This book answered some of my questions. The information it does give is good information. It reassured me that I am headed in the right direction. But it was general information. I still need more detail.
They r trying to make games like floppy bird but are morning's good enough jobI like that they used different colored tubes as your score goes up to
I have always loved Dooney &amp; Bourke products but I must say I'm not impressed with the Leather Case. It is to small for the iPhone and almost phones, not room for money or any cards
It was a slow start book, but got really good towards the end. The f word in the book that many times made it less enjoyable, but it was still overall a good book.
The design is great but the quality is not the best, I have used it maybe 20 times (2 months) by now and it seems like I have been using it for the double of time, I have other belt that actually look like new even within a year of use.
When I ordered this, I had a 34DD chest and 38&amp;#34; hip. I had gotten a large. But it hugged my hips and butt really tight and unflattering, and strapped my boobs down, thus making them look saggy. I loved the color and material, and if you  are more petite, this would be great for you! But for curvier girls, like myself, I would not recommend.
When I first got it, I loved it! I loved the color, the material, etc. However, I was wearing push-up a bra when I first tried it on. I am quite busty (34DDD), I had got a Large, and it was still way too baggy in the chest! When I tried to wear it with a push-up bra, it went really low and I had cleavage for days. When I didn't wear a push-up bra, it was really baggy. If you have time and money to get it tailored, or if you like extra cleavage, this is definitely the costume for you! It was comfortable and all, it was just hard to constantly be pulling up the front.
So I'm aloud to get any app I want and I don't wanna spend. 6.99 on ANYTHING. Pleease lower the price to. 99 so I can buy it
I had stray cats crawling under my house and fleas came inside the house. I had to use several different products inside and outside of the house for weeks to finally get them out of the house. Plus I had a neigher block off the entry points with chicken wire. I haven't had a problem since. I also check the crawl space under my house to see if they're squeezing through the blockade. I only used this product in the house, so I'm not sure how well it works alone and I had to use products almost daily for  a few days to break the flea cycle.
While I am not familiar with Phillipa Gregory's novels, I took a chance on this series because of my interest  in this moment in history. I was hoping for something along the lines of &amp;#34;Vikings&amp;#34;----- a balanced mix of drama &amp; action. But this is more like Downton Abbey in tights, heavy on the romance while all the action (the battles, anyway) takes place off-camera. This is definitely aimed at a female audience The political situation at the end of the Wars of the Roses was extremely complicated , but it seemed to be over-simplified, at least as it was presented in the first episode. I may or may not  take a chance on the second episode, to see if the aura of Romance sets the tone of the entire series.
Very hard to believe, but oh well, is a nice quaint love story, cute. Adults viewers only. Teenagers will never get it.
Lip sync off-movie had to keep reloading-Not a good experience-Have found that the &amp;#34;Free&amp;#34; movies all have this issue.Not real happy with the Prime Video.
good afternoon, I have a doubt in Venezuela phone works perfectly with any of the operators? I await your response, thank you very much.
I received Lexmark 150xl ink cartridges quickly. I;m grateful for that. Only 1 thing, the black ink leaked a little onto my clothes, but other than that it works great
The bracket rusted within a few weeks :(
Very flimsy.. looks just like the photo
First of all, I supposed to get 3 in 1 but I only get the fish eye and lens I never get the micro lens . So I rate this for 3/5 but it doesn't mean I didn't like it. I like/love but if I have the micro lens then ill be more happier. But thanks  though.
Not spectacular enough to look through more than once or twice. High priced for what we got. Cute pictures though.
The mat is OK, but is just a flimsy piece of paper, not real mat board, and certainly not worth the $10 plus $5 S&amp;H I paid for it, but for some reason no stores in my area were carrying these types of mats at grad time, so I was stuck buying one on line.
If the story were longer with the characters fleshed out more, it would have the potential to be a better story.  The writing came across a little stiff and mechanical, much like the characters, come to think of it.
Good product, but I didn't like the way it holds the tablet, a little bit insecure about it, but other than one is a good product
This Is A Fun Activity to Do With A Family Member But It's A lot Smaller Than The Package Makes It Look Like...
It's ok in the sense i hope the antibacterial properties are actually working, as far as cleaning linoleum floors it leaves much to desire.
Its okay for budget scratchers but these are plain bamboo ones with a somewhat fast finish on it. They are not that thick also. but you pay for what you get.
Started out good, but the ending wasn't. It had a lot of twists and turns and I wasn't sure who was the good guy and then I figured it out. I felt like it wasn't really finished.
I really like the boot, and it fits fine, but when I received the boot in the mail it looked extremely olive. It was more of a green than a tan. I returned this boot for the whiskey color. Otherwise it is cute!
Its no Bull-Nox or Hemo Rage. It is a servicable, but not great pre-workout. i use it on days when i am doing lighter training so i dont get burned out on other better pre workouts.
Cutsie movie. Fun to watch but not much of a plot. The actors did a pretty good job but the story line was lacking
this movie did not keep me to interested but it was ok. Not as good as I  thought it would be.
If it wasn't for the mini games there really wouldn't be much to this game. The only good thing is that you get 100.00 bonuses every so often so you can keep playing
I can only say it is ok for me to use. We know this book is very old and I just need it for one year! If I need to value it, it can achieve between 2 and 3 stars
shouldn't expect much for this bargain price.  It will not win any costume prizes for sure, but might get your child's one big wish come true.  And thats because kids are easy to please
its a kids toy; yet it is quite delicate.  I expected more life for the price i paid.Maybe my son was too rough with it.
the delivery time was ok the case look's nice . I bouht two of them but after aproximatly 3 weeks of wering the edges of case start braking . But for me was ok I say that for that monu you cannot uspect higher uspectations .
My daughter likes the jacket. However, the picture on the website showed a black jacket with hot pink on the sides. When the jacket arrived she was disappointed to see it was solid black. It is very soft &amp; cozy so she decided to keep it because she did not like the other color options. If it looked like the picture I would give it 5 stars.
Well, there really isn't much I can say.  I got the game in a timely manner original case and all that, and there's nothing wrong with it.  I think this game deserves a 3 out of 5 because the actual game just kinda sucks. I mean, you figure that for Dreamcast the graphics would be better, and that there would be a more in depth storyline. It simply put falls short of other versions.  Honestly, I miss arcade systems :/
The control is hard, and the story is,...okay.  Other than that it offers online gameplay, and is a cool game to own.
CUTE COLORS, GOOD STUFF, SO I'M VERY AGREE WITH THEM AND THE SETTING IS GOOD.RECOMMEND THE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE.
They are SOME LARGER THAN YOU SEEM,YO I USED IN THE SNOW AND ARE VERY WARMRECOMMEND IS A VERY GOOD BOOT, THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT
The phone inside the case moves alot I'm not able to text some words but other than that I love the case
For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]We're thrown right into action from the first page. The book begins where we left of in Nightshade. It's packed with information. We learn about Searchers and their world, the real story of the war between Searchers and Keepers and Shay's role in all of this. Even if the pacing was slower because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was necessary, the author had to explain everything before getting into the plot. I loved learning about the truth at the same time as the pack. Some stories surprised me like the one about Ren's mother.Like I said in the review of the previous book, I loved the characters. It was the same in this one. I was anxious to find out what happened to all of them when Calla left at the end of Book 1 because I could very well imagine that it would not be good for them. I can only think of Ansel, Calla's brother...  The new characters introduced in this novel were interesting. I absolutely loved Connor and his humor even when everything was going wrong. His bickering with Silas made me smile. And what happens with Ethan, his evolution, is cute.Overall, it was a good read. I felt like nothing really happened. But the next book will be filled with action that's for sure!
Thethird book is action-packed. If you like action, you will be served in this one! There is almost no break, we go from one place to an other. There is no time to waste before the final battle happens. Between the planning and the hunt for the pieces of the cross, of course there was also a time for romance.Calla is still torn between Shay and Ren. When she's with one, she can't stop thinking about the other. I was a little disappointed with what she did with both men. She acted selfish and it was like she didn't think about their feelings. I think she should have done things differently.The end ruined it for me. I enjoyed the book so much, but I still can't believe what happened. I was really really really disappointed to read how the love triangle ended because it was one of the easiest possible way to do it. That's the worst ending someone could ever imagine. I don't understand why, I just don't.But a good read anyway. I think even with all the disappointed fans, you need to read it to see for yourself. One scene doesn't make the book. I was also pleased to see that Andrea Cremer decided to write a fourth book in the trilogy: Snakeroot and I will definitely read it! I'm intrigued about what it will be about.
First and foremost, it's a hidden objects game.  If you do not like such games, don't play this one.  It's also a Facebook game at heart meaning you can play so often.  All in all, it's not the greatest game, but it is decent.
fun. easy. runs smooth. great time killer. not as brain involved as candy crush but still requires a little bit of brain power. its fun for kids too.
This was an OK read, but was a bit slow and maybe it was just me, but I found it a bit difficult to follow at times
The skeins were smaller than the ones I purchase in the stores which took me by surprise. I had trouble finding this particular color scheme in stores around town so I went on line. I need it for the border on a blanket. I'm glad I purchased two but noe I'm thinkging it's may not be enough.
My granddaughter is into everything &amp;#8220;Paris&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;I bought this for her to hang off her backpack. I was a little disappointed that a little part of it broke off, so now it doesn&amp;#8217;t stand as a matter of fact, it&amp;#8217;s in the trash. Guess you get what you pay for&amp;#8230;
Fun  and exciting to work on the puzzles to clear the blocks and save the pets and receive the necessary points
I have Read Many Book by Kiki  and this was not her Best .This is the type of book you read if you have nothing else to read .
pretty easy to install, and when the door closes it isn't that loud at all.my cat hated the magnet part and wouldn't come through the cat door until i spent 20 minutes tearing the plastic and magnet off of the thing.
Cute but it fell apart within a few days. The acrylic ball just cracked in half. Oh well, good thing it was cheap.
Patterson's books are always &amp;#34;a good read&amp;#34;.  His short chapters keep the story line moving without losing the readers interest.
It is NOT a beanbag like it said in the title. But I don't mind. And it's face was kind of naturally mad; so I spent some time trimming the facial hair to fix it's expression.
I bought this flavor to try it. It is alright, however it is defiantly not the best flavor ever. The protein does its job, but I wish I had gotten chocolate flavor.
These did there job but they also leaked when you took them out of the printer. I wouldn't exactly recommend these if your not on a budget.
The book was okay.  Not one of my favorites but didn't hate it.  The story was getting very tired and I couldn't wait until it was over.  I normally have to make myself slow down and savor a book or become mad that it is over.
While I enjoyed most of this one, I felt like the author just gave up 3/4 way through and then just ended.  Very interesting twist on the zombie experience.
Item does not mention that there is no rotation for mount. This makes it a little hard to set straight on most windshields.
Very well made, yet for me the material was a bit to streachy but may be perfict for someone else.
Very well made, but I need more coverage on top, I have to be careful bending over. Yet may be great for someone else.
Not the best but if you are looking for cheap screen protectors, these will do and they do help a lot.
I don't read to be depressed, I read to be entertained.  Most of what I read was well written, just not the content I'm interested in.
too much texture, hindered touch screen usuage a little and dirt was allowed underneath surface easily. It was an inexpensive purchase so I got what I paid for.
But It will be good if you give some info for dummies in the area. I had to replace by myself and it was kind of difficult.
Even though my usage of these batteries is boringly constant, it seems that every once in awhile, I wind up with an unusually-short life.  It's sporadic, but it does happen.
I really didnt like the swearing but it is a good book to read! i kinda did like it !
I am not too crazy about this product yet. I have not been taking it long enough to make a well determined call on if it is working or not yet.
I have not been on this product long enough to be able to make a good call on whether it is working or not yet.
Nice quality but wish the black was a true black. It's kinda faded.
This is a great jacket, but 3 stars because I recieved the Mighty Lite II as opposed to the current model, the Mighty Lite III, listed here. Have tried all incarnations of this jacket and the subtle design tweaks in the Mighty Lite III made for an improved fit for me. Previous models were oddly narrow at the top of the sleeve, with uncomfortable seams in the pit area. My arms and shoulders are not big. I'm 5'5, 130, and a small in the Mighty Lite III is a more comfortable fit for wear with light or no layers vs. the previous models. That being said, I had to send the Mighty Lite II back and get the III directly from Columbia. Dissapointing to pay full price for an older model, when you can spend the same on the current updated version... which is what I thought I was getting here. Someone dropped the ball! Great jacket with great features, though. Figure flattering. Great as a mid-layer when it's very cold. Love the thumb-hole cuffs! Worth the trouble to get the right one.
I really like this item.What I didn't like was its chemical smell (formaldehyde or something).Also, it drains batteries (or perhaps that's just me).
I'd heard so many raves about its performance but I found no superstar.However, I think every woman should have one if she just wants to kick back and relax.This product requires a lot of manipulation.
This item is not bad, could be a little more rugged, it is easy over tighten and bust the end where the battery goes when you are replacing the batteries, the sound is not a clear as would liked.
Very rugged case but the clear protective cover over the main screen is sometimes hard to use with your finger and you have to swipe a lot of times before something happens on the screen
Its a good watch specially for its Price. It has a sport wallet. I like it... ... ... ... ..
Not sure why they took this off the market.  I absolutely loved Honey/Beige as the Natural Beige/cool is too white looking.  I live in Florida and have more of a tan.  Always had compliments that I looked younger....I'm 44 and people would say they thought I was in my 30's.
I paid for the Action Replay DS, and I got it. But the problem is, it's one of the early versions of it and it was shipped to me with no AR CD/cord to quickly add games and cheat codes to my Action Replay DS; which means I have to insert everything manually with my DS touch screen's crappy keyboard.It can perform all the cheats Codejunkies has to offer, but if it's not pre-set, be prepared to spend a hell of a long time typing in each code.
Air bubbles form early and often which makes it look a little bad and can be annoyingly hard to get rid of since the stickers are a little thicker than one is used to dealing with, but otherwise looks great and has a nice feel to it.
Book. Arrived in good order and very quickly. My only disappointment was the postage and handling black plastic bag stapled and that cost me over 10.00. When the book weighed no more than 150gms. Was willing to pay because present for someone who had been looking for this book for a long while. Don't know that I would do it again would rather pay more for book
took forever for this to come and it almost didn't come before I needed it for my daughters first birthday party...and when I got it I busted out laughing as it is very tiny like maybe 1.5 inches across the widest piece of the thing
The kick stand on the back of the case doesn't work. you can open it and set it down but it snaps closed almost immediately.
The quality of this cube is not really good, but what are you going to expect for the price, just fine if it is your first 2x2. I like it, but I think it could be better
A bit slow in places didn't grab me early enough. When I persevered it picked up and was in the end a good story.
Was not as useful as i thought it would be. Maybe will be more useful as we all get used to it and find out more. We don't use Facebook etc.
While using it the first week it broke.  We were able to take it apart and fix the wire that came off.  The cats do love it though, it's better when you get it still and move it yourself because the cats like it better that way.  I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't broke because the cats do love it.
Love the iphone case but wish it had screen protector attach.  Took too long on the shipment. My son love the case too.
magnification times too high, not fit for hand-hold.  magnification times too high, not fit for hand-hold.  magnification times too high, not fit for hand-hold.
it is a nice simple ring but it was not what i was expecting. the turquoise &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; was barely a stone at all.. i do wear it and its nice but i am still looking for another turquoise ring
did not receive ubs,  cord as it stated it was included.  No instructions as how to get clock off military time and onto regular time. No instructions on how of program or search FM radio stations. I feel that the instruction manual need a LOT OF WORK. A little to technical for the average person with limited computer  tech knowledge..
Just downloaded so not sure needed a hint so I had to rate this to get the free hint  so I not sur and nreed to type 20 words
it was really cute and great while it lasted, however if your someone that drops your fone a lot..like me..it will break on ya in a few months of use. it did come quickly though. i just am either a little to clumsy or the quality is a little lacking. thanks
I got this in the mail in 3 days and hate it. It won't let me play any games on ps2 even if i download it onto my ps3 and its a wired joystick. The picture is of a wireless joystick not wired. If i had know it was a wired joystick i wouldn't have bought it. It also feels like really cheap plastic. But otherwise on the actually performance on ps3 games its ok, no dual-shock though which sucks. But for the price it was at i will give you 3 stars
The quality is too general, I don't feel very good&amp;#65292;Feeling a little short&amp;#65292;Quality is really very general&amp;#65292;It's not worth the price
this can be worn well beyond 12 pounds, its much larger than it seems like it would be.  Can use later on.
For the price I expected a better quality.  This is a very thin dress. not well made or something that seems like it would withstand multiple washings.
It wasnt what i was expecting but I will keep and maybe I can use later or find someone else
purchased for grandson......he is only 5 but we enjoy crafting together....he loves it and left it @ my house so he will have it when he comes for his sleepovers.....I predict many memories will start from this Art set.....
I am still working on getting this program to work....I'm not very computer savy when it comes to these programs...  I followed instructions and got it downloaded but am unable to open up instructions....will have to call for assistance...
It only grips for a few minutes then my phone falls right off. Works better after cleaning, but has started to leave a sticky residue behind.
Not really a compelling story for me. Disappointed to learn that the author did not have first-hand knowledge of the culture or the era in which the story was written, and the descriptions become repetitious starting about halfway through the book.
Sorry to see the shoulder area ends very short of the average female figure.  it is hard to fit a blouse or top if you don't have suffucient width there, as this measurement is cricital to a good fitting garment.
The headset itself is very compatiable with my phone, but the earbuds are made of a hard plastic and very uncomfortable.
Sold and shipped by amazon.I love the way this thing fits! If feels amazing. It is truly fully adjustable with hook-and-loop shoulders and 3 adjusters on each side around the waist. I've worn it practically every day for a month with no accessories(to poor to afford everything I want in one order).I'm a maintenance/facilities management guy and I was tired of running back and forth for things and saw this as a way to fix that(excellent idea, by the way. I think all trades people should have something like this).within a week, stitching began loosening in the molle loops. All I've used it for is a caribiener with keys(35 keys, to be fair). One loop came out completely just before I received my first accessory pouch(Condor). Don't plan on taking this to the battle front. Weekend use for airsoft/paintball/hiking, maybe. I am looking and may spend around 100on something better in near future. (P.S. I thought the hydration bladder pocket was a plate carrier, shhhh, don't tell anyone, it's embarrassing!(Update:05/10/13) I've loaded the vest down with 15 lbs of gear, including my CamelBac and 3 tactical pouches. I've run, jumped and moved heavy items. I haven't yet improved/repaired/reinforced the molle webbing (and it needs it) but it seems to be holding up pretty well. 40 hours a week plus, wearing this, the wide flat shoulder straps are starting to cause slight blunt discomfort in the contact area(no chafing though).I'm still of a mindset that this could NEVER hold up under real combat conditions.
some parts are cheap looking but it will be cute on him.
The bibs are nice in themselves, seem to work just fine although they are a bit thin, but they did not fit around my 18 mo baby's neck. Would be best for a younger/smaller baby.
Pretty set but too simple, not enough shine or luster except for the middle stone. Nice but I'd recommend the heart shaped set by Berricle instead. Wonderful shipping but I think I'm going to return.
Adequate, but nothing to write home about. It's a mid-range product. This takes out small scratches and not tar or paint marks/scratches.
The story was good a twist at the end . What I appreciated was the characters reasoning with themselves and finding a solution and that made the difference. It also showed that when two people meet there will be differences but it is how they resolve the differences.
it works what can i say it is what it is i mean really you can see it and that is that
i have dragon and wanted to use it for that purpose but it will only work if you talk loud and there for it will get just an ok from me
What is this a college textbook?  $80 for a softcover and the pictures are in black and white!  You can't even read a few of the pie charts because they are in black and white and you can't decipher 6 different shades of gray....The content is decent but there isn't anything in there that the million other Lean books don't have, it's just in the context of emergency services and priced 5 times as much.Basically the professor (Dr. Noon) saw an opportunity to partner with an ED physician (Dr. Crane) he had in his MBA class to take the same material that is in every other lean book, put a different context around it then price it like other professors price their text books.
It is a wonderfully illustrated book. I purchased it for my 88 year old mother-in-law who does a lot of knitting and crocheting for kids in hospital etc. I think the children will enjoy Amineko
A good Mills and Boon read which I enjoyed but probably wouldn't recommend as they all start to sound the same after a while.
it fit my phone just finebut after 10 days the design started peeling off at the sidesalso its in two pieces and it really very difficult to have the locks snap into placewen u do get it on it sjust finemy phone hasnt fallen to see if it withstands impact tho
I just think it was a good book. I really liked the Jennifer Ashley part of the book. I will go back and read this one again to see if maybe I missed something.
for an adjustable ring it doesnt adjust much, im sure its great if your really fat but i got it thinking id be able to make it fit my somewhat small fingers sz5 but i can only get it to stay on my middle or thumb other then the size issue though its nice cute and arrived really fast
This book started out fast. Then it kind of slowed down. It picked back up(a little bit), but I kind of feel like it's dragging. The good part is, it keeps you interested, and want to continue reading. So, with that being said, I guess I'll wait for book two.
i'm not really a video poker player. its good for those who enjoy video slots. IT WILL KEEP U OCCUPY.
I liked the main character development and the man vs himself aspect. However, the knowledge of weapons was a little sketchy and gas goes bad after a year or so unless you use a stabilizer.  Also the characters had a tendency to start shooting when they should have been quiet, such as when they first went  to rescue the lieutenant. The jumping back and forth in time was well done. It is a good zombie story and I'll definitely be reading the second book
this flashlight mount definitely is not bad for the price. its nice and universal so i can use it with all kinds and sizes of flashlight. decent for a man on a budget.
Makes you wonder!!
These lights did the job but were not &amp;#34;Neon&amp;#34; as described. I bought them for an outdoor 80's party and they looked more Christmasy than anything. Not very bright but again, did the job. Not the usual size as &amp;#34;rope lights&amp;#34; a little thinner. I did like how they connect so theres no break in lighting but I did have to call the company to figure out how to connect them because there are instructions for everything else about the lights EXCEPT how to connect them.
Stunning part works fine. Sadly the flashlight is off and on working at the momentBut still. It works great for defense and it came in good time and packaged well
It wasn&amp;#699;t as bright as I had hoped.  I thought I could use this to light up my scrim...but it&amp;#699;s WAY too small.  So I&amp;#699;m using it to send a wash down onto my DJ rig, as it changes color.  Good enough for that use.  I&amp;#699;ll use some slim-pars for the scrims.
battery life last under 1 hour, but it works, thats really all that matters. but hey it was cheap and it works
I bought this striping tape thinking I could use it for making designs and creating perfect stripes. When I got it I was so excited. It was easy to place down on my nail. However, when I put the top coat on, some of the color from the tape was gone. Then the tape began lifting and peeling off. I ended up just painting over the tape and peeling it off to create lines. By itself, the tape is not a good nail art tool. When used to make other designs on your nail and then just peel off the tape, though, it works better.
These is an essential product to have when you are out all day but that plastic taste is there after the water sit awhile.
This clothes were a bit to soft for my liking but for a baby these clothes are absolutely perfect. Great price!!!!
Very smooth, moisturizing with very littlescent.  Haven't been really in the sun yet to see how the spf protection is.
The recording quality is mediocre. I found it to be contrived. Also, it doesn't follow the instrumentation for the score.Postive elements are: The demo is useful to get one's bearings &amp; some of the accompaniments are well represented.It wasn't a waste of money, for the price it serves a purpose.
i rili shuld give this watch 5stars, judging from the package it came in, quality and condition. got it for my sis and i didnt even av d wrist problem seen in most reviews. but the watch seems to work only wen its being worn(meanin u av to set the watch errfin u take it off) Also, the indiglo light seems to dim after being used a couple of times. Other than this, 9ce watch
Pros:I really like this phone case you can put your credit cards, I don't need to bring my wallet anymore.Cons: Only 3-4 max of your cards that you can put inside.
I really like the product but now I need to look for a better quality. It almost break my phone. :(
Amish blizzards series are just very  short stories.I am disappointed in in them.won,t bother to order any more.  They.  Should be ..one bookYou. No sooner start and you  are finishedI would not recommend them.
The rubber bulb doesn't push out the water as well as a plastic bulb from like a store bought douche
Bought it for my bf so far he enjoys it  and uses it everyday . so yes id recommened this product.
The tablet is ok.  It entertains my son, but I had to go through a lot to get it started.  Prior to buying make sure you have Wi-fi and make sure you have time to go through All the set up process.
3.5 stars!To be clear, I enjoyed this book. It was pretty good and the characters were awesome, but at times it was a bit... boring. I think some people will compare it to twilight, and it is similar, like so many books are, but this book at least has fun and entertaining Main Characters. And the writing is good. I just would've liked to see more action, more... something. Maybe in the second book?Sunshine is about Sophie. She has an allergy for the sun which means she's almost as pale as Caspar, Snow White or a vampire. At least, that's what the kids at school say. But she doesn't really care anymore. She has two amazing best friends and she can always count on her family. Well most of them anyway. And then Myles comes along. It's clear from the start that something's up with him. He has secrets, but so does Sophie. Both of them have a past they do not wish to share. But as they grow closer, more and more secrets will be revealed.So this story is good and well... Like I said, it was a bit boring. For the most part of the story, nothing really happens. Myles and Sophie get to know each other and their friendship grows and blossoms into something more eventually, but nothing exciting really happens until we hit the 80% mark. If the characters weren't as fun and cool as they were, I wouldn't have given this book the rating I just gave. But it's nice to see a friendship grow into something more between two people. Especially a human and vampire. Yeah, no surprise there. Most of the book is told in the blurb, which made it a bit predictable. Oh and by the way, not to sound like a total geek, but in the above quote... Charmander first evolves into Charmeleon and then Charizard. (Okay yeah, I'm a geek.)I think it's clear that I loved the characters. Sophie is pretty cool. She has a milky white skin, dark magenta hair and wears combat boots. Seriously. Awesome. And yeah, she has issues to deal with from the past, but I get it. There is a depth to her and I liked that. And I loved seeing her growing and learning to care of someone other then her two awesome best friends. Talking about best friends. In this case we have a Korean brother and sister, Boo and Trei (as in peek-a-book and tree). They are soooo cool and funny. And there are some other well-developed side-characters like the stepdad and sisters and high-school barbie bitches. But I hated Sophie's mom. Not exactly mother-of-the-year material. But I really loved Myles! He's a cool vampire and he cares for her. I like the vampires in this book by the way. They're cool.So overall I liked this book. And the ending pretty much made up for the boring parts in the rest of the book. So I'm excited to read the next book sometime in the future! And I do recommend this book to people who love the genre and want to see a relationship that grows for a change. No insta-love in this book! Hurray! But okay. So check this book out people!
I usually don't read books like this and that's probably the reason why I gave it just 3 stars. I usually look something that I could take for myself from the book. I don't want to say that there is nothing to take from this book, but it's not much. For me this story is more like romance and struggle in love story than a story of human transformation and finding something meaningful in life. It's a classic story of bad boy and innocent girl who finally find each other and the bad boy changes to good side. Many movies are made on this topic and many books are written as well. I usually look for more meaningful lessons or stories in the books.Reading this book it usually seemed that I'm reading some Gothic theme literature, more likely to be some vampire story. It's too much darkness in this book. I understand that it's a novel and it's creative work, but I'm looking from the perspective of what I can learn from this book. And as I mentioned above it's too much to read all this book, just to understand that you are the only one to fight your darkness within.I could recommend this book for people who like dramatic love stories, vampire love stories or similar - you might find it interesting, but as a literature of human transformation and lessons in life, sorry, there are much better books on that purpose.
I am ok with this game.  My 14 year-old grandson said he enjoyed playing this game also. I added it to my favorite s
Was ok for the price. I found them to be a bit light. The tip could have had a little more foam to it. But al in all a usable product.
Ok but a little to big for the phone to fit exactly. But worth the price I paid even including  shipping and handling.
Ordered these before I read the description that they don't work with the Kindle Fire. They work great with my mother in law's phone though!!
I was skeptical of this product because it was so cheap. But i have seen an improvement on my acne scars. However, i havent been usin git multiple times a day everday as it reccomends.
This is a beautiful bra and provides good support, is comfortable but the under wires in the front poke out :( And I cant return it so I'm stuck with it. Probably wont be ordering from Amazon again.
I really enjoyed reading it for being the 3rd book in the series, Michael Grant kept the story line alive and I liked reading it.
Story ended too abrupt.Many people were involved in the story, i.e. Cody, Bailey, Ashley and family, but none of the individual stories had an ending.
The earrings are cute, but the backs are slanted and push behind your ear a little. But they look exaclty in the picture. Super cute on.
As my first pair of bike shorts, they are comfortable but a little restricting.  It's nice to finally have some padding, but I don't feel as if the padding is ample or made of the best material.  At this price range though, they are well worth it.
First I would like to thank Amazon for all the help and information plus the wish list feature. You found me a unit with ease ofuse at a price that I could afford. I am a recent student of the computer (June of 2012). I have not had a problem with thisitem yet, I take classes at a computer club and this size seems to have the least problems.Thank you for all you do.
Is not as goog as  I Believed, Does not compress too much space, It usually open by it self in the journey
A great classic that speaks to the soul. Written in a tone that has stood the test of time. I certainly would recommend this book to anyone.
It is aight, ain't tryin to buy stuff on here like those coins, so I'll just get free ones any way I can
The stamper works great but the scraper thing is metal and I hate it. A credit card works just as good though, if not better.
They are okay . . . A bunch of different colors; but it is a pain in the a$$ to try and top coat them without the edges peeling up.
Good quality I really recommend! They fits perfect on the face and they really help to keep the sun out of your eyes
I totally love it I purchased this item for my son it was sheep in price but very nice looking it holds 20 men's watches I'm really glad I found it and it was deliver within 3 day's
I don't recommend movies, this was okay for a few hours of useless movie watching.  The acting is a bit lame.
Everything about this product was accurate and it didn't end up being a fake or anything, but I just dislike the bulk that this case adds to the phone.
I bought these for the cabinets I was making expecting them to deliver the same soft close as in the Blum drawer slide, which is very good. Problem is that the installation guide does not properly explain where to drill the holes. It says that the distance is 32mm plus the height of the mounting plate, but in their adjustable hinges if they are moved slightly inward it has the same effect as a raised plate. Secondly, even when that is taken into account, unless the door is very wide, it gets stuck on the piston and doesn't close unless it is pushed, which defeats the purpose. To properly install, I placed them 65mm away from the side of the cabinet and now thy work ok,just they are a bit quicker than the drawer slides and the doors with built in blumotion (which can be a good thing). Also, it is worthwhile to get a drilling assembly to accurately drilll the holes at 90 degrees; it can be messy if you don't.
This beading board is ok, the lid doesnt work well, my beads easily come out of it which is irritating. The board itself is decent but I would probally buy a diffrent board in the future.
decent muzzle but still enough room for the dog to chew and get into stuff, wish the part where the mouth is was adjustable.
These were to be Cotton but they are Polyester, they are cardboard and not round,  so I am having problem trying to get an even stich on my sewing machine.
They look cheaply made and I like the self-Threading needles that you thread on the side not the top.  I give them three stars.
I bought 2 pieces and shipped it all the way to Saudi Arabia (the shipping cost a bomb) upon receiving it and setting it up, i soon discovered that I was sent 2 pieces that didnt have the backlight !!!!!!Product isnt too bad, but not getting the backlight (even though i paid for it was a total bummer!!!!!)
Not all that impressed with this for the price.  The only way for the fan to run is plugged into your computer so the battery is getting twice the pull.
I ordered this because I decided to get a gym membership and get back into shape. It fits true to size and the support is incredible. My boobs didn't move an inch when I jumped around. However, I'm returning it and giving it 3 stars because the shape looked terrible on me. It was too wide and flattened my boobs in the center by pushing them out to the sides. I looked embarrassingly wide and flat. I'm very narrow and close-set, and this just didn't work for me at all.
The 2600 has to be manually operated. When I first set it up, I swear it would automatically place the time in column 1 and the next box over or when the clock goes past noon, it would place the pm out date right nex to the in time. I contacted customer support and ther person helping me had me reset the unit. After that evry time the an employee wants to clock in and out it all has to be done manually. If you pay a little more money and get the next model up, you will be happier I think. By the way, I called back to customer service tech help several times and anyone helping me after the first person didn't seem to know anything about the 2600.
This type of material gel gets dirty pretty fast it's so cute the color but wish it wouldn't get dirty the way it does
I would normally get a medium but should of got a small. Very recommended and different then the norm but it a change.
We get this jeans but they are not low rise and not Straight. They're high rise and slim. In general quality is good though fabric is rather thin. Maybe it was a mistake of Amazon who shipped us another item...As we cannot return them now, my husband can wear them but feels a little bit disappointed as expected another model.
I have super thick hair and it is too much for these pins. They are good for small pieces of my hair only. But my friend with finer hair than I, LOVES them! Thank you!
I chose 3 stars because the book was a little ...jumpy. I moved fast and sometimes it was too much. Buy overall it was a happy feel good story.
I bought this thinking it would be a nice thing to use with my kindle.....Its not all that great...It bends when you try and stand the kindle......its ok for protection but not its purpose........so if you need one buy a better one.......
The case was a little to big. It was supposed to fit an iPhone 4, but the case was a little loose. Also, when I took pictures with the flash with red one, all my pictures had a red tint...
it just doesn't fit every badge, if you have patience and a sharp knife to customize it, it works just fine. does the job. i bought it for part of  Halloween costume.
I Liked it but it didt protect my screen from cracking so it was very disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend it.
Fun game but is a little buggy when the reels are spinning. I do enjoy playing the game to waste time though.
The images do leave a certain lasting impact, but the story is wonderfully whimsical. A delightful book for young ones. I  know my 21 month old sat quietly listening. What I dont like about it is my friend who isn't too familiar with reading with expression wouldn't fair so well reading it to a toddler. Not an easy flow.
I bought three of these for all of our vehicles.  One does not like staying mounted.  Other two work great.  Just a little quality control issues.
The mount is good if you account for the play early on. There is a play between the wall bracket extensible rod. I attached the projector to the mount and turned it on to find the best spot to drill a hole on the wall respective to my screen. After drilling the hole and mounting this whole thing i found there is a play as soon as i suspend. Luckily i was able to adjust the screen a bit and a few things on my projector. The circular disc from this three prongs hold the projector is adjustable but the play was beyond belief and even with the provided adjustment it wasnt able to perfectly align. if  you extend the rod the play increases or rather worsens. I would spend a little extra and get a better one.
I purchased this case as it was one of the few cases I could find that was both matte and red.  The case is very slim and adds barely any thickness to the device.  I keep an extra battery in my wallet and am often swapping out the battery once it dies.  After about a dozen times or so I noticed a small crack coming from the top-right corner of the case.  The case is a very tight fit that requires a bit of force to remove from the phone.  However, not everyone has multiple batteries for their S4.  For those of you who don't change the battery, this case is just fine.
Since I bought this for a Halloween costume, I didn't have any great expectations. It looked synthetic and some of the hair had gotten twisted in the bag so that it ended in a flip rather than turned under. The snood was obviously cheap and didn't want to stay on the wig without a couple of large bobby pins (not a problem). I was able to make it look more respectable (for me, an 'older Cleopatra') by shaking it in a bag with baby powder. That dulled the plastic look and gave it a bit of gray. I would never have purchased this were I looking for a human-hair looking wig, but for what I wanted it for, it worked.
This was a costume for a school project. We actually used it for Amerigo Vespucci. It's small on the sizing though. Stitching on the back of the top came undone straight away and I don't think my repair will hold for many more wears as the fabric is very flimsy. But not hugely expensive and if you're not creative and need a quick and easy costume, then it's ideal!
I love my old sketchers that I paid $60 for, they are about 5 years old with daily wear. They are still wearable with no tears or anything. The only reason I had to have another pair, I wore them while I was working in a kitchen for about 7 months and they are just filthy now. I have also washed them in a machine at least a dozen times. Now I use them for running shoes. I found this pair on amazon for $39.99-at Black Friday. They are hardly worth that money. They look and feel shorter in the front, a lot of the reviews say order a half size bigger, I am now regretting not listening to the reviews. If you are buying a pair on here please consider doing that. Comparing them to my other Sketcher D'Lites they come up way short in my expectations. They are cheaper for a reason. They don't even look as pretty as the ones you look at in stores.  I will update my review in a few months, right now they are a 3 stars to me, if that.
This is not the first kindle book that i have purchased where the spelling errors and wrong word substituted has been dreadful.  Perhaps its just me, but I think the amount of typos in kindle books reflect the quality of the product delivered,as for the story - i have purchased book 4 - only because I like to finish a series once started.  It was a nice waste of time to read the series but i really started to be annoyed with the &amp;#34;top of the tallest mountain&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;colder than the coldest night&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;bigger than any monster ever seen before&amp;#34;.  For mine that is a cop-out on providing a meaningful description - and it is descriptions that keep the reader entertained.  The characters had potential however they never really strayed from being good, bad or hero.
At first this shirt was good but after washing a few times it lost the tightness and did not fit as well. I will be returning this shirt for a refund unfortunately.
What did you think you're buying?  They're regular jeans. They run a bit big but they are still jeans. What you see is what you get.
The quality isn't great, but that is to be expected for the price.I like it mainly for the case and all the smaller brushes it comes with for eyeshadows and lips, etc.The face brushes are not soft.I'm not a huge makeup fanatic but I could tell the quality wasn't great.Fast shipping though and as not bad considering the price!
I'm a home remodeler I use the floor nailer often enough to be able to tell you it's good, I don't recommend it to anyone using it on a daily basis
After going through FIVE Lifeproof cases (insane!), I finally tried the Catalyst + Survivor case. Overall I was happy with the case; the design, screen protector, and audio quality were excellent. BUT, there is one major flaw, the plastic that covers the camera lens completely blurs all of your photos. I have tried 2 different cases, both with the same problem. So unfortunately I cannot recommended this case to anyone who takes lots of photos with their iPhone.I hope Griffin will fix this issue, because it's a great waterproof case otherwise.
got this for my son for xmas. didn't realize u need and external hard drive just to play the game. It was not in the description at all so he now has a game he cant play that he was dying to get. doesn't work on the xbox360 4g without the drive.
It doesn`t fit elegantly at least in petite ones. Love the softness and the colour. It made me look square.
the canon camera lens cup is nice but it send me by DHL like hell the thing come to my house and i open it up the out cover of the lens cup like s****!!! and i need to give as a birthday give! if the thing.....
It was okay i expected the box to be worn, but not opened I don't know if the film was pressed or not.
A romantic mystery that was not too bad. I am not keen on romance stories, but this one was tolerable.
Different from what I am used to reading. Not a bad read all in all. Might try another one some day.
Unlike temple run, brave is really hard to get her to jump and side to side and I have to push hard on my tablet and really do not like that. Other than that it is okay.
This is mildy enteraining. It has super short webisodes that don't really connect. Waiting for season 2 to start so i can continue the show. It's just ok. Not that great.
While it does offer a lot of information about medical genetics, the written language is overly complicated and does little to introduce medical students to new subjects.
please forget the color you saw...! nothing like that.fortunately I ordered one size up. So no complain with toe box.heels are wonderful and love the footbed too.looks weird (11M) but guess that I'll love it more later...
Picture on cover is what you are being taught in this book. If you are looking to learn how to crochet, this is not the book for you. Actually, I learned by watching videos on YouTube. Then I looked at books, magazines and tv shows. This book has information. It has one pattern followed by more info. It's not a bad book but title is misleading. I suggest you get this book while it's free, but use it as a guide and one of your tools to help you learn to crochet. But be aware that it won't teach you in your first steps of crochet.
FOR A FEW BUCKS IT DOES THE JOB AND LOOKS NICE I RECOMMENED IT FOR WORK OR A YOUNG KID
They are comfy is why I chose them. I have no other comments to say about this pair of houseshoes.
Wallet has the capacity to hold what I need -- various cards, paper money, coins and keys.  Its appearance is acceptable, and I like the window that shows my driver's license without having to take it out of the wallet.  However, the wallet's coin purse is not durable.  The fabric inside the leather cover has frayed, and the snap is coming loose.  I've had to use tape to hold the cover together.
These are ok I guess. I bought them for P3 of the HCG Diet since there are no sugar, syrup, etc.I probably would not buy them again, but I will finish them no problem. There just really isn't much of a flavor at all.
Received this on my porch on a Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised. Packaged well. I give three stars only because the 11 inches were very deceiving.  This is the smallest doll my daughter has. It's cute with its little creases and such, but I could have found something at Toys R Us for the same price, and bigger.  Not to say I won't order from them again, I will just have to get a bigger one. My daughter loves it all the same.
It was a good book and in was really into it but it cut off so short! I am looking forward to the next one.
This is an interesting story that moved along at a good pace. I enjoy young adult books that have substance, and characters that overcome physical and moral challenges. I look forward to the next book.
I specifically ordered this firebowl because it was advertized as a 35 inch firebowl. After receiving it in the mail, the bowl only measured 22 inches. It was too late to swap it out because I was having a party that night and couldn't order another in time. That's false advertizing and it needs to be fixed immediately.
Pretty standard romantic comedy. Somewhat predictable plot. However, it's definitely not a bad movie by any means, and is good for an occasional chuckle.
generally the design is good and convenient but the quality of the brown leather is not, as it started peeling of in less than 1 month.
For the money this belt is probably a good buy, but certainly not anything special, but it does hold the 12 ga. shotgun shells tightly, and it will fit up to a 48&amp;#34; inch waist size, so &amp;#34;It's An OK Shotgun Belt&amp;#34; that for the money that I would recommend !JM
An interesting read. Definitely one and done for me. Leaf is the most messed up protagonist I had the pleasure of reading about, through his &amp;#34;God's Eyes&amp;#34;. So, it was comical at times, strange mostly, and to be honest, I bought this book because Satan Burger is something I would have come up with for the title. So I connected on that level. Many times it was just strange as hell and gave me weird feelings b.c it's just such a strange story. The images this book puts in your mind is pretty gross. Definitely funny and I wont ruin it for you, but personally the ending made my skin crawl and the very end was just oddly strange and left me feeling like man, I'm sorta uneasy right now. Weird, I know. Sorta left me wanting more, but it definitely ends... So, for that, this book offered an interesting experience b.c it makes you jump out of your skin. Nothing about this book is normal and based on that, I liked it.
I think a majority of the bad reviews I read about these cartridges not fitting may have to do with the model you are fitting them into. I noticed hardly any reviews included the model #. Well, here is mine: MFC-J825DW. I have installed only one black cartridge so far. I will update review to include any subsequent pertinent info. First, the package arrived with only one damaged leaking cartridge, a red one. Next, the plastic film covering the inkjet hole is very hard to remove easily without patience and a small sharp tool. Installation was easy enough, and after just one blank page, it printed well and normally. Bottom line, for the price of just one manufacturer approved replacement cartridge, you get 10. If only 2 of the cartridges work for you, you made your money back. I think the great price is due to these few obstacles. So....&amp;#34;ya spin da wheel, an ya take ya chances&amp;#34;.
Average. A little too unbelievable in parts. I guess that's why they call it fiction. I will read another tonight.
Could have pages that were lighter in colour, a little hard to read. It did come on time to my home, Excellent service
It looks good but it is incompatible with  typing and the 5 way is hard to operate when playing the brain game.
It does not feel enough like a real game. The game does too much for the player. I probably should have expected that.
the style and color is great. But one thing I dont like is that there is no mic with the headphones.
This was a Birthday present to myself. The music was OK.  It was sent quickly but given I ordered and payed for new the CD was not wrapped as new CD's are. The music played fine.
My daughter had only carried this to school for three days when it started falling apart at the top where the straps attach. A few days later it broke completely. I was very disappointed in the quality.
the boots are light weight but they are not warm at all so the term blizzard is not correct I like the solid grip on them and the overall build is really nice
I downloaded this and was having the greatest time playing it but I was getting low on gold so I decided to re install,low and behold I cant reinstall it,even after resetting of it says I still have it installed and I can only open it which doesn't work....sloppy job amazon sloppy job....
This story is different from Hamiltons' other books with Anita Blake.  It just shows where she stands with the police, not anything real exciting like her other books.  I enjoyed it but it really didn't have a purpose.
It's not the color that looks like on amazon.... It's to tight on the phone!!!  The reception is bad once the cover is on the phone :(
This item looks very nice. However when using it, you can tell it is cheap quality. I guess if you are on a budget, which I was at the time, then this item the good. If you can spend a little more, then you might want to get a different item.
I definitely enjoyed this book. It was a good quick read, I would recommend. I HATE that Amazon has a requirement on how many words I have to use for my review. That's not necessary!Sometimes less is more!
It fit well except I ordered the wide and it was too wide for me, but the shoe was well constructed.
Good laughs, but same old thing if you are into celebrity gossip. It's like she does not have any imagination for funny material, but then again that is her mo. The &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; list stuff. Not family material.
Perhaps I should have known, but the inside of these cards are dark and thus hard to write legibly on. Otherwise the cards are fine. Very plain, but fine.
Good quality wig, but the blonde is much more yellow than the photo depicts  :(
This is a great quality wig, however it is a much lighter shade of red than in the photos.. also the ends are wavy with no curls :(
Did not come with Power Cord.  Power cord is needed for constant projection to work. Set up is fairly easy with the instructions.
When I saw the optical port, I assumed that this card had Dolby or DTS on it. It does not. This means that your optical port will only transmit in PCM, AKA 2 channels. This makes the Optical port nearly pointless. Although, I did get true 5.1 surround sound using the ports on the sound card and my receiver that has multi channel input.
I found it to be very creepy and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.  Too close to reality for me.
I downloaded the free version from here (which turned out to be an older version); after the program updated itself through the developers' site, I found that even though it's nowhere close to Microsoft Office (it won't even change fonts like the online user's guide shows, nor will it let me print anything for some reason) the interface is decent and there's not a lot of clutter on the screen. The main problem I found is that to have the truest professional version of this program you have to  BUY the Windows-compatible suite (at 50 or roughly $120!) Let's face it, shall we? If we wanted to spend that kind of money, we wouldn't be looking at freeware, now would we?
I bought this for my wife for Christmas.It had been recommended to her,but it was difficult to obtain seconhand in U.K. She hasn't read it yet,but is looking forward so to doing.I was pleased with the rapid service and Quality of packing.
Each bag is only filled about a 1/3 at the most.I would eat 3-4 bags at a time easily.I did some pricing and found the best deal on cinnamon apples is at Trader Joes or Whole Foods.You can double the amount for the same price.
chocolate taste great! but was all melted and stuck together so it was messy and we had to cut off pieces to eat it.. but it still tasted wonderful.
its alright, the tray to hold paint is to small for those nice no spill paint cups... and its very hard to find the paper roll size unless u get a very skinny one or buy directly for there website..
But needed more!  Of their budding relationship, the mother's involvement, how they fared against Cromwell.  Was there a word limit requirement?
It's ok i guess, when spraying out it sometimes never comes out of can evenly. Also it is kinda strong smell at first, so might want to check your allergy to it first in a small test area. It does mask odors or etc for animals or just heavy traffic areas and will die down on odor strength after a few hours or a day. After  three days though its not even noticable but no odor.
It's ok for a regular face size and for the money works well, but for a large face man like myself it looks kinda small on me.Durable lens and plastic design, appears as if you could switch out lens.
It works ok, sometimes the spooling mechanism gets hung up and cord does not want to wind itself. But for the price you get what you pay for, overall a short good retractable cable for using any phone to aux usage.
It fits like a hard case on back and keeps it tight, the back is that gel rubber which i don't care for as it tends to be slippery especially with oily hands like me and leaves streaks. The sides are a rubberish grip but more hard like a plastic than real rubber. It's ok but the perfect one would be this with real rubber gripping bumper sides with a back the same.
Was free, has good beats and good tone. Likable some not sure on the group as a whole yet. will see later
The short its fine, but it is too small and obviously too short. but the padding seems to be ok.
Very nice cover, however, it was too tight that i had to break one of the ends to take it off my phone.  Now struggle to keep it on.  I had three men try to take the cover off!!!
Well, the stainless steal fell out of the first one I got but good on the seller for shipping me a new one right away. I got a second one which looks better then the fist one and seems a little more solid. Hopefully it lasts. But seriously ... it looks really really impressive.
This game is a HO game, and as such is not outstanding. Some of the objects were too little or camouflaged in the background. The atmosphere and sounds were appropriate to the story of this game which was a gloomy and spooky one.It has a decent length to it. I give it three stars because of the graphics that could be better.
I'm giving this a 3-star, would have given it a 5-star but my kindle fire hd keeps hanging whenever I open the application and have to restart for it to function properly. Otherwise, the pictures are great and crisp, it jumps out on you and you would love to try it out for yourself.
This oil is okay. The smell doesn't last long. Only one day on a cotton ball. But it does smell good in a diffuser.
Questions were rather simple, &amp;#34;What is your favorite food?&amp;#34; etc. Not very thought provoking, but not too bad for long car rides.
Not a bad movie, but not great like the first. Still better than the second. My 7yr old loved it.
The book holder was great. It would be perfect and do the job if it was wide enough at the top to fit my treadmill. I wanted something to set my kindle fire on when I was on the treadmill and ordered this holder but it is not wide enough at the top to fit over the lip of my treadmill. Nice holder though!
This is an ok game but there are so many more out there that are more interesting that I probably would not down load it again on my kindle. These apps do not run quite as good on the kindle as they do on the computer but they are ok
Game is fun and keeps you interested. Is a little slow compared to a lot of the slot games but is still fun.
It's an easy read and entertaining enough to finish it but not very exciting. The characters are a bit too shallow to be interesting.
Its cute....I may keep it or give away as a gift, I thought it would like a little different then what it looks like.
This game is probably the best one I have but NEEDS a huge fix. I gat random pop up adds that will not close down, that helps ruin a great game.
Very cute outfit, a little smaller than expected. Very cute though. Like how a pair of socks came with the outfit.
You can play it online. That's the benefit of having this.  The control is terrible until you change it, as well as how fast your character moves and jumps. It's hard to shoot targets, and the story is a classic.  Cool collectible but not extremely playable.
Better than the first book.Good  who done it. Next one should be interesting.Can 't wait to read  it when published
bought this so crap does not go into the cracks of the keyboard which it have prevented but it no longer lays perfectly flat...thinking its the heat that has made it this way but still use it everday
I bought them for my granddaughters.  It seems to be more difficult to use than I expected.  I hope that it will help them with their dolphin kick.
I got this as a new one but if the time goes...the color stains to dirty one.I'd recommend pink color one, cuz sky blue color will be stained to green one.
It was described well, just a shown. I love it! BUT, the ball is very hard to unscrew to be able to put in. Still cant get it un screwed.
These bowls are certainly nice to look at, but also are perfect for a bowl of cereal.  They are a bit strange with the square bottoms...!
The outward facing cover is nice.  My iphone 4s slips around inside the case which makes it difficult at times to push the home button.  The cover also can get in the way of the camera and the flash.  The credit card slots are extremely tight and tore slightly when I tried to pull the card back out.
The short stories are well crafted.  The second part of the book is a continuing sad story of a dysfunctional family.
Nice songs I can listen to it all day I love her so much it's amazing song I can relate
As I expected it did not cover every details of the so called perfect language C#.Still I can learn basic idea of the language and English grammer too.I'm not a native English speaker that is why I learn English thru' computer language English book.Maybe this book is for me since I'm a dummy.
Loved the movie and thought the book would be good too I was wrong though it added to the movie the subplots were not needed and the author got lost at times frst the main character has boots then she magically doesn't then she does was a bit annoying.
My incredible 4g LTE phone was not charging for some reason so I bought this so I could just change out the batteries when it got low. after about 3 months one of these generic batteries stopped holding a charge, but between the battery that came with my phone and the extra one I have from this it is fine. I have had it for just short of a year now, and it still works as good as it did the day I got it.
It's okay, I think, for the price. I have the choice to use with battery or electricity. I bought this camera for curiosity.
Steam is having problems with this game and its not letting me play- I would check to make sure they have fixed it before purchasing.BUTThis is still an great game I used to play it all the time but I lost my disc copy.
They are cheap in cost so dont expect much from these, they do work but the sound sounds like it is far away. the comfort is not great either, but do remember... You get what you pay for.
Not as good quality as the 30 year old one I am replacing but it is okay and easy to put together. I have extras to give as Christmas gifts. It is currently in my hall with coats, etc. on it.
Some of my baby skins areas like knees , arm pits were getting blackened due to crawling and other fun activities , we bought these mitts to clean those body areas , Those helped but not fully . my baby plays with while bathing. So it didnt serve the purpose fully but , its okay kind of product .
It's an easy fit and looks good. It does'nt seem too durable though..we'll see. I was expecting a thicker material.
this is a helpful tool on putting your hunger in check. It does curb it for a few hours, but the taste to me, im sorry to say, i could not stand it. I tried many times to force myself to keep using but just cannot. May you find this product better suited to you. The seller is fast at shipping. Products arrive safe and sound and super fast.
The book was good but the only thing I would change is adding more description of the characters. I could picture very well about what they looked like.
Not wide enough, often shifts and leaves room for leaks. Love the material, just wish it was larger and offered more coverage
The package &amp; the book is acceptable.But the mailing period is too long. It seems to take more than 1 month
not magnetic on the the tablet. but its ok, im using right now POETIC slim and the keyboard externally, just in case i need to type a lot.
The description says the toy is 8&amp;#34; but when i measured it, it only had 5&amp;#34; that was insertable. Other than the size issue I enjoy the toy.
I found it short but fun. My kids love it. It's helping my 6 year old with groupings and common items.
This book seemed to start off good...but I just had a real problem with the characters. The sex scenes were just as good as book one...if not better.  It was something with those characters that I just didn't like this time around.  Once I got  in I read the last chapter because I didn't want to invest too much time into these characters.  While it was OK...it had the potential to be so much better.  I think Book II was the darker version of the, oh so sweet Book I.

One of the better apocalyptic/post apocalyptic books I've come across. Definitely intend on reading the next two books in the trilogy.
Not really what I was expecting.The filing is not thick enough and doesn't stay where needed. Will use but not real happy with it.
Since the title says &amp;#34;belly button rings&amp;#34; (plural) I thought I'd be getting all five. I only received one and did not get to pick the color. The belly button ring I got is still cute, but not what I was expecting
Nice look, good material... took three weeks to receive the sweater for my wife (as a gift)... would order another IF had more choice of colors!!
I like the shoe but they were darker than I expected...returned and purchased the slate, which is a nice gray.
I thought this would be long like in the picture but it hit right above my ankle. It is much cuter in the picture.
It only lasts for one hour of battery juice, not cool but it does work well so far.
They are roomy. Kids took all their stuff to camp easily. One bag already has a hole though, so not sure how they'll last for next year.
Still trying to figure this product out. The product is ok when I really need it to work it won't we charge it every night and it will work for 1 or 2 uses, but then it fizzles out.we have a German shepherd /Rottweiler mixed so she's a pretty big dog. I couldn't wait for this item to come in and I was thrilled that it work so well at first, but like I said after the second use it didn't faze her the power was weak. We keep trying because she hates to hear the warning beep she will back off which is good I hate to do any thing to her but if she needs it I want it to work, but I can't rely on it.
Great for the kids and the. Family ..... for those scary notes.  That you love too do. Onto others  on Halloween night
I've read almost all of the Alex Cross series over the years and generally find them to be a fun, relaxing read. There are twists and turns in this one, but the outcomes are predictable.  This was not as intense as many of the others, especially some of the early books, but it was still an enjoyable read.
Liked this nail polish but for the cost it doesn't really last long. If you use it as a top glitter coat it's fine but to use it as a solid shimmer takes up to eight coats.
I love the song, and the download has no issues.  What I did have an issue with was that this track has way to many beeps in it.  I didn't realize that I should have looked for a listing with 'explicit lyrics'.  Perhaps if the 'explicit lyrics' track had been listed with the one I actually got, it would have been better.  Thanks for listening.
it's a little smaller than expected, Must be mounted properly to really work well. The assembly only came with pictures no instructions but pretty easy to figure out
It was simple to use and the small bottle will definitely last if you're just using it on your face but it seemed to look a little orange the first day or two.
These pants seem to be well made but also seem to run small. They fit (barely) in the waist but were to tight in the seat and thighs. I wear both Levi and Canyon Ridge and they both fit fine. In closing while they are well made you will need to buy a size lareger in order for them to fit.
It has an orange color, not red...I should have listen to the reviews..
Three stars instead of five because while it is a French company .... It's made in china :-( still, a classic doll for childhood
The dress  itself is sweet I don't know how they match these pants to that dress not too good otherwise I'll buy again thank you
(I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey ENTR 300 class and this is my recommended reading.)This book started out as a good read however, as the book progressed I began to lose interest. The beginning of the book was highly informative and was very detailed in regards to the challenges and accomplishments between Google and Apple. The book nicely sums up the rise of the technological age, and provided interesting facts regarding the development of the iPhone, iPad, android phones, and tablets. The beginning descriptions were very insightful, dramatic, and well-written. For example, in chapter three, Vogelstein describes an incident where Steve Jobs receives harsh feedback when he reveals his brilliant iPhone plan. Despite the harsh criticism Jobs received on his product, he still pushed forward, and in turn, create a whole new meaning to the word &amp;#8220;technology&amp;#8221;. I was able to take that situation and use it toward my own business.While the first part started off strong, as the book continued, I began to lose interest as the main topics originally stated began to disappear.  A lot of the ending points discussed we confusing and in a since, off topic, making it difficult to draw out the underlying meaning to the book.Overall I think the book was an ok read. While the book defiantly makes some interesting points in regards to starting and owning a successful business, I don&amp;#8217;t believe that the booked help me at all. I say that because my particular business is real-estate, something totally different form technology wars and inventions. I would have benefited more from reading a book that focused on the actual structure and maintenance of a successful running business. I do however, think that other Entrepreneurship students, looking to dominate the technological world can benefit heavily form reading this book.
I have had a hard time reading this book, as well as the one before it. I wouldn't consider my experience &amp;#34;trudging through&amp;#34; the book, but rather, chugging along. I've read the first book of the series, the short story, along with this one, and I believe this is where the experience ends for me. If you're a teen reader under the age of 16 or so I'd recommend this book. It's a decent starting read with almost nothing in the way of complexity. Easy to follow &amp;#34;plot&amp;#34; The If you're at least a semi-serious reader of fantasy novels then don't waste time on this book. It's not that it's not good, it's good, but there's much better books out there to spend your time on. The book just doesn't flow well in my opinion, it has ups, it has downs, and it has bumpy patches that could have been smoothed out. Some parts feel like they could be fleshed out more, and others like they last a little too long with not much to keep the reader interested. If you loved the first book, read this one, if you had reservations after finishing the first, find something else. I hate to give it 3 stars, but the way I rate books, 1 is terrible, 2 is bad, 3 is good, 4 is great, and 5 is for only those few authors whom I feel truly deserve a 5 star review.
Story is written for highschool age readers.  Very inspirational themes particularly interesting for school students looking for ways to reach their own potential.
Ok, so I liked the story but was a bit up and down and the ending just left you there.....
This product is as described. It may be my hair, or maybe the shape of my head , but it tends to slide back. Also my forhead gets itchy because of it. I can't seem to find a comfortable alternative. Recommendations welcome.
i bought these and have had a hard time getting them to grow but i have more and will try again.
had a hard time to grow these but i have more that I will try again
This ring is super pretty and has the \look\ of being close to authentic although the stones around the center are small and need cleaning often. I would definitely recommend to everyone to buy CZ and not real diamonds. Real diamonds lose their value and you'll never get retail price or even close. Save your money! The issue I have with this ring is after 3 months, the center stone fell out. Just looked down one day and it was gone. Make sure to check the prongs regularly and don't expect much from a ring under $50.
I needed the energy. When I'm sluggish and just don't want to do all that I need to do, SPARK givesme the boost to get it done. Thank so much.!
i use this a lot but there is one thing that sucks and that i can read for about 2 hours and play games for about 30 min then you have to wait 12 to 13 hours to charge that sucks that you have to wait that long befor you can use this great item again
Need two more belts loops like on my previous pairs.
Found this book quite boring but I had to read all of it to make sure. Not really my genre but the cover pic was gorgeous.
Unfortunately I found it a bit long winded and boring. I finished the book but now cant really remember what it was about so that has to tell you something.
This was an interesting read but in parts I found it quite boring and wanted to get to the end as quick as possible. Story line was good but it didn't have any magic in it for me.
Thought these books sounded intriguing but I was wrong. Still a good read but I have read better. They were well written but not to me taste, I think.
I just recived this very nice but made on the cheap side if you tighten the bolts to much metal bends also has some broken clips and scratches on it. in the prosses of working on a return for a new one.. but very nice to relax on if you are not a picky person this is the swing for you.. I am a QC guy at work so any damage sticks out well I give this swing 7 out of ten enjoyYork pa
Delivery was quick. But the material tore really easily. All she did was pull it up and it tore. It was hard to keep up in place.
Still reading this book, but it's difficult to stay with.  I will continue, of course because of the subject matter.  Thanks for asking.
I'm not sure about this book.  I liked it yes, but there were parts of the book that I was like WHAT????  They go from no sex to a sex marathon and then they are having sex while eating breakfast.... I didn't get that part.  Also is the author not from the state's?  I don't mind where she's from but some of the vocabulary was off.  Yes, there is a cliff hanger.Would I recommend this book, yes but I wouldn't until the end of February when the second d one comes out.
I think it is a good app but it does not have sound. I got this for my little one who cannot read yet.
Bought these at Wal-Mart the other night. They seemed like they'd be pretty cool, but instantly had the black plastic piece on the smaller knife fall off on me. Easy fix but they could have put more effort in securing that piece down besides a single strip of (barely adhesive) glue on the back side. Then, the next day I had the screws strip out on the belt clip on the larger knife. Keep in mind I hadn't used these knives at all except to clip onto my trucks headvisor. You get why you pay for. Other than that, the blades on both knives are very sharp! And the belt cutter and the glass breaker are definitely a great add on (main reason I bought this set)!
The fan fit perfectly in the fan hood and works great.  I am concerned though, with the fact that the stator is considerably smaller and light weight in comparison to the original.
Save your money. You can easily find these exercises on the internet. No need for the book. -certified international sports science association trainer
I got my case yesterday and it fits very well. I have 2 complaints though...I don't know what it's been kept in or what but there's an odor that's almost unbearable! The other thing is I'm not fond of the stylus pen. I think it should be easier to use like the one that came with my Samsung Galaxy Note II.
Its a really good case...but doesn't last long.The corners start to tear after a few months of continuous use. But its not horrible by any means and it covers my nook well. Just minus the tearing in places its a decent products
Ok so this light is NOT 400 lumens.  I&amp;#699;m not sure how they&amp;#699;re getting that...but it&amp;#699;s probably not even 200 lumens.  My Olight T25 which I received in the same order is listed at 210 lumens, and it blows this 400 lumen light away. Next thing that was a little odd: This little flashlight arrived in NO packaging other than a little bubble wrap bag, which was inside of a brown shipping envelope.  There were no packaging or invoice paperwork, no directions, no nothing... But I knew that was probably going to happen based on other reviews I&amp;#699;ve read on this light.  The light is decently bright.  Didn&amp;#699;t blow my socks of by any means.  It&amp;#699;s compact, runs on a single AA battery, and has a decent clip on it.  The focus feature is...nothing really.  I just keep it on it&amp;#699;s brightest setting and leave it.  To cycle between modes you have to quickly press the on/off switch.  I like that it stays in the last mode you had it in.With that being said... I paid 7 bucks for this light with free shipping, and it arrived ahead of schedule, and in great condition.  I cannot really complain because I knew exactly what I was getting.  I gave it 3 stars because it&amp;#699;s just ok.  Nothing special.  Just a decent Cree LED flashlight that runs on a single AA battery.  I would probably buy a couple more to give to my wife/kids to keep in their car/purse/bag. It&amp;#699;s small enough that it doesn&amp;#699;t get in the way too much.
Invest in better goggles. If you want to see everything in orange these goggles are for you. Go photocromatic it is worth it. Julbo is fantastic So are Smith optics I/o
Small but does the job. I would get the larger one though. The make is top notch. Amazon is the best!!
Rough feel to it. The regular liner is better and easier.
Nice neutral color but I guess I need a good primer as it didn't last very long at all.
Good human hair, exact length, the only bad thing is that I ordered black and they sent me dark brown.
The overall design of the mouse is great. It feels very good in your hand and the laser is very precise. Now what I didn't like about it is the weight and the lights. This mouse is noticeably heavier than all the previous mouses that I have owned, which makes it harder to pick up and move but you eventually get used to it. The main reason i gave this mouse a 3 star rating is for the software. It comes with a CD that has the driver for the lights and other settings in the box, but you need to change the name of certain files so that your computer can recognize them because they are originally in Chinese. Another option is to download the drivers in English from Overload Forums, which you have to make an account to get permission to download it. Once you finally get the driver installed, it doesn't even work! The only setting for the lights that does work is the one that cycles through all the colors, which I believe is the &amp;#34;demo&amp;#34; mode. I wanted to change it to solid blue to match my case, but that is not longer an option. Overall, it is a good mouse, but if you are crazy about the lights and being able to adjust setting on the mouse, there are much better mouses out there for this price.
Mass produced Chinese mount - a bit sketchy. Different as pictured and does not have the bolt - only thumb screw. Was banged up pretty good as well with corners missing paint. Rock solid for kids airsoft playtime, you can do way better for real AR builds. Little GGG mount is bomb proof and made in America! Return was challenged by Amazon...
It is good buy just if you are to strong watch the screws. Don't over tightened them because they will break off. Very easy installation.
Great read. I love the subtle personal growths of Eve being displayed, how it makes her a more rounded character. Her evolution as a wife and friend plays into her relatability as cop and advocate.
It's a pretty decent game for free, but it does get a little mind numbing. All in all this is a fairly good game.
I was slightly disappointed with this product because all the lipsticks look the same on me... bright pink. They are good in the fact that they moisturize and stain my lips for a long time. They are good if I wear one and then apply a real lipstick over it so if my actual lipstick fades, my lips will be stained from this product.
3.5 starsThis book was better than I expected. Yeah, the fact that it's about elemental powers has something to do with it and the fact that the main character has the power of my favorite element, fire, has a lot to do with it, but it was just a good book overall.Yeah, I think this review will be a bit short, but I don't have a lot to say about it, so. And it's not a bad thing! The story was good, the writing was good, the romance was good. It was just a good solid book! And yeah, pretty original too. And I'm happy the author gave me a chance to read it. I loved the world she build in this book and how she handled the paranormal stuff in it. Yeah, elemental powers are a weakness of mine, so it was hard to not like this book. But if it wasn't that good, I would've been honest about it. Not everyone can get it right, but Jessie did.I liked the characters, they were pretty well-developed and I liked most of them. Kiarra is cool, with the power of fire and all that. Wish I was her. Or rather, wish I had her power. Jaxton was.... yum first of all. He was cool and I loved getting to know him. And I loved Neena too. Again, all of the characters were great. And I can't wait to see what happens next, what their new adventure is.The book is the start of a new series and I'm pretty excited about it. I want to know what happens next! So yeah, I liked the book and I'm going to read the next books in the series.
Steve Jobs is my favorite personality. I was very excited when I found out that there is going to be a movie about him. Of course, I read the book about Steve some time ago before the movie was released. So, after reading the book firstly, the movie didn't make me a big impression. I was absolutely obsessed by the book and compared to this, the movie was just OK. I admit, that Kutcher's acting and directing of the movie is great, but the story itself is missing the thrill which you get from the book. When I was reading the book, sometimes I got the shiver by reading things described in the book (mostly the achievements of Steve). I didn't feel anything similar in the movie.I don't want to say, that the movie is not worth watching. Yes it is. But just one time. If you haven't read the book yet, then I greatly recommend you to watch the movie first and read the book afterward. If you are choosing between the book and the movie - choose book. You will never regret!
Scanner works great! But when I entered codes from three different vehicles into the DTC definitions; came back &amp;#34;no codes found&amp;#34;. I googled the codes and had no problems.
A little far fetched, but the story was well written. Hard to imagine Denmark attacking the Arctic backed by Russia.

I was looking for a brown tote came a cross this one and I love it. Great Colorado goody quality and berry spacey for dose who like to carry a lot of stuff .
Okay Movie I don't really recommend movies.  If you want an okay movie to enjoy for a few hours this isn't bad.
I like having him in front.  The padded front makes me feel like he's safe. He LOVES biking with this.  Installation wasn't easy, and I wanted to adjust it much further ahead so that I could completely rotate my knees but it wouldn't go ahead far enough.
Overpriced ...Shipping Taxes Are Ridiculous For What It Is And How It Was Packaged ... I Bought It Because I Had The Dog Pet Stocking Given To Me And I Thought It Was Really Cute .
fits fine. My dog has only worn it for 5 days and there is a hole and the strap just fell off. He hasn't been tugging or biting it either..mostly wears it supervised and not a very active dog.
Easy to use and very handy. Information included is very useful for the reader. Makes reading the books more meaningful
it looks like the picture and is as decribed but cheap quality some of the plastic holes are filled in and flimsy. would not buy again
Its alot of lashes. 3 boxes,10 in each box, 2 in each pack so that equalls 60 pairs. And they only give u 2 tiny micro minnie lash glues. But overall there good lashes last all day.
I ordered a womans 8... Theese shoes are very narrow i cant even wear em.waist of time and hard earned mulla
I can't tell if this is polyester or cotton and if will fit my sewing machine,  It's okay for the price.
It's a fun game with lots of flash, color and sound. However, I have to repeatedly quit playing after just a few minutes because there is a limited number of lives. I don't wish to have to contact my Facebook friends in order to continue playing. An annoying drawback to an otherwise fun game. I wish I could play it for longer periods of time without having to quit.
Blackberry are just that, Blackberries, the phone freezes at will and most of the apps comes with price. My opinion is there are better phones out there for the same price that can do a better job. Blackberry needs to fix their operating system!!
These bars arrived quicker than anticipated but for my preference, were not very tasty. I kept in mind the nutritional value of the bar as well as the high protein content and low carb for certain activities that I wanted to use them for. Mostly I used them for recovery. The flavor was not coconut but just a bland tasting chewy substance.  They weren't untolerable but I just had to tell myself they were beneficial and will definitely order Quest again, just a different flavor!
The instructions are easy to follow for learning the movements, but the routine is too repetative for my taste unfortunately.
The product was pretty.  The fabric was very nice and looked great.  Ther control was cheeply done.  simple on/off button (which was fine), however doesnt work very well.  At times, would have to turn on/off numerous times before would start working.  Have had it since Oct 24, it still works, and we still use it.  Control just aggrivating at times.
We ordered this and got it really fast, but it was in pieces when it arrived.  Probably got damaged during shipping.  We contacted the seller, who was really great.  They immediately shipped a new one.  New one arrived really fast and not damaged.  A few days after we got it, it was broken.  It seems like a cheap product that isn't very durable.
yeah that's my personal review some stuff  are good sign stuff  are bad you see there radii gave  that's it I don't know what to tell you more
It was not as depicted in picture. Picture showed an aluminum or similar type finish.  Came in 100t% plastic. My husband put it on anyway and it looks fine. Time will Tell. I would not have purchased if I had known it was plastic. I guess that's what marketing does, show you a superior product and sell you an inferior product in the hopes you wont send it back?
These headphones are working fine with me however they are a bit expensive. Many times the bluetooth disconnects and it's annoying.
I was searching through Amazon looking for a new case because I was tired of my old Otterbox that was getting washed up. I stumbled upon this one and thought it would be a great fit. It came in the mail in about 5 days and I was excited to start using it.At first I was very pleased with the case. It looked sleek and it was protective. I got the navy blue matte finish one for the iPhone 4. The adapter hole to charge the phone was a little to small. The adapter would fit but it would fall out if you were using the phone which became frustrating really fast. But the major problem was that the corners of the matte finish on the back of the case started to peel off. This started about two weeks after I started to use it.
Pretty neat. Guess for the price it does a decent job. The main drawback is the volume of un-popped kernels.
I am pleased that my case arrived fairly quick, but not too pleased with the look of it.The product preview depicts a more realistic looking stitch, with a dark aqua blue belly and eyes, maroon colored nose and feet, and eyes going into the edges of the case.Here's a picture of how mine looked.[IMG][...]As you can see, my colors are way off, and it looks more cartoon-y.Still pleased, but disappointed at the same time.
Just for show, not very durable, or a of great protection.  Colorful and easy to coordinate, with clothes.  Enjoyed by everyone.
I just needed one part that clamps on my uniform for work.  All other parts haven't been used yet.  I will probably use the dash mount eventually.
Bought it for my wife and she uses it in her car.  She can even get out of her car and walk around it while carrying on a conversation.
its an ok set the only thing the knives are reall dull but all the other stuff was good dishwasher safe and better than going to walmart and spending 2$ an item n the cutting board tiny its more like a cocktail cutting board n the can open broke on the first use
If you like quality do not  spend the cash. I have 5 Birkin inspired bags, Which I bought from a number of suppliers. This one is definitely not BIG, like it says in the picture. The seams appear very poorly made for the price.I compared the inside, outside, size. strength, &amp; quality. And I find it to be the same exact bag i bought on Ebay for $29.00, both bags looks just like leather. The Ebay bag has side rounded double bound seams on the outside. Otherwise, both bags were exactly the same. Only difference is one smells like leather and the ebay one has silver hardware and amazon had gold. I will give it 3 stars only because its leather.  I love Amazon and will continue to buy, but this one is not worth it.
THE PRODUCT COMES IN A SIZES MERY SMALL, I ASKED SIZE L, IT ARRIVED SIZE &amp;#34;XXL&amp;#34; BUT IT IS VERY SMALL FOT ME, ABOUT THE STYLE THEY ARE VERY PRETTY BUT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SIZE
This sucker was hard to put together (I seriously put the crib together much faster). It seems as though the pieces were too tight (I think I still have 2 screws that weren't put in, because there was no possible way to screw it in (in some places). My baby only used it the first 6 weeks (I know it's meant for the first few weeks), but if you're looking into a bassinet (buy one that is a playpen) it would be a smart buy!
I'm giving this item 3 stars because I do love this type of organization. Unfortunately, as soon as I got the package delivered I put it to use in my diaper bag, when I pulled them out (still the first day of having it) to show my husband, one of the tabs that hold the hook to the mesh pouch completely tore off &amp;#128544; (so the hook was clipped to the ring without the pouch). I didn't overpack it at all. I didn't want to go through the hassle of taking everything out and returning it, so I'm just thinking of keeping it (I will contact the seller to see if they'll send me one replacement pouch, if possible... If not, then I will return it). I think it's a bit overpriced for something like this to happen.
My daughter is seven.  She is quite big for her age.  She is tall and quite plump in areas.  Furthermore, I bought this in a size large thinking it would be perfect because that's what she's in right now.  Unfortunately, it is a little snug, but she loves the color.  It's not too bad.
One of the valve leaks air . Wont stop, only when I put the valve cap on. Checked it a week after it still leaje whem I remove cap
iPhone 4 / 4S Anti-Glare, Anti-Scratch, Anti-Fingerprint - Matte... GenericIt's a piece of plastic - what more can I say.  It's a stocking stuffer for my grand-daughter.
You paid $10 for a polo?  Guess what you got?  A $10 polo!  Not the best quality, not the worst.
When I click on friends and gifts, the box pops up to enter my character name. Can't get to my friends or collect my gifts. Fix these issues and I would give this game five stars, I do really like the game.
Item needed 4 S hooks and 2 chains to install on my existing stand. Was advertised as having everything needed and it did not. Was easily solved with a trip to Home Depot.
the story line was OK---overall many of the children I work with can relate to this book as they struggles to accept 'no' for an answer- still I would recommend this book.
I am a medium and this one fits a bit too tight. Nice cuts at both sides. The fabric is a bit rough.
I love items which look original in a way and I loved this one, the colour is gorgeous BUT the front fabric and the back one are different in texture one is soft and dropping fabric and the other is a bit more heavy so it falls somewhat queer.
It was an OK book if you ask me I would not buy it it isn't worth the money It is a poor book I'm glad I have prime
101 Series - What every leader needs to know about Attitude drives home some of the core leadership principals. a good read for the leadership junkie!
It is quite pretty and my sister loved the ruffles. However the material is scratchy on the inside and the ruffles get rather flattened and crumpled during shipping. Also I'd say it needs thicker straps considering the dress isn't that light.
It is an ok tea,not the best or worst.  It seems a lil weak if you ask me.  I wish it had a stronger taste!
Comes with no instructions so not for a newbie. Took  some time since i painted all the details. Looks okay. Not as great as  the St. Petersburg church puzzle.
Its alright you can guess the songs and the pictures pretty much say it all... it also is a good way to waste time
These are not really nice pieces...For the price I guess it's good...But I would not order this again..Sorry...It did ship ASAP...
I was so excited to get this in the mail...When I opened it the silver foil does not go all the way to the edge where the silver lip is and just ruins it...I would return it but it's not worth the cost to do so I am keeping it...
When one of my older two speed  battery Dremels gave up, I felt it was time to give a power hitter a try. It needs to be used with a flex shaft attachment as otherwise it to bulky to use with accuracy, but i iallready have a Fordom.  For other users and uses it is a great tool with power to spare.
Didnt like it , i ordered size 18-24 MN but it fits a 3 year old and the white cotton not beautiful !
It's not the exact one for my planer.  But I can make it work.  I believe the issue is with Stanley and their marking / nomenclature.
Fits all my pot lids perfect. I hang it on the wall because it wouldn't fit in any of my cupboards. I ended up painting is silver to match the stainless steel appliances.I wish it came in different colours. But it does the job.
it said leather i thought it would be a better quality its ok just not as nice as i thought it would be
Sat down with my 4 yr old granddaughter thinking we would have a fun few minutes. Did not happen. A lot of the differences are miniscule. She quickly grew bored. I challenged others to spot the differences and no-one I asked could find all the differences. If u want a challenge then this is for you.
It is a fun game. Putting picture together myself to get answer would've been better. Not sure I trust an app that pays for ratings within first ten pics
So i picked out a few of the free puzzles, one of them was the sea shells pack. I was down to the last two pieces. I looked at the last two pieces, then went back and swiped my finger over the puzzle to see if I had messed up. Nope, the last two pieces didn't fit the two spaces I had left. I realize I am using a free puzzle but this doesn't induce to buy the app. Otherwise I love the game and enjoy playing. Except when I have left over pieces that don't fit puzzle.
I downloaded this app the last time it was offered for free because of the rave reviews. I didn't play it more than an hour before removing it from my kindle. It just didn't hold my interest. I wish I understood the reasoning behind offering it a second time. It's not that good an app.
THE PRODUCT IS IN GOOD CONDITION THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT FREEZES UP EVERY SO OFTEN AND HAD TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES IF I COULD DO IT OVER I WOULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE BUT ITS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO ONLY PLAYS WITH IT EVERY SO OFTEN SO WORTH THE MONEY.
Cruzin for the thrills and some spills. Game took a few tries to get the hang of it but now its all about fun
its a great game but ones ur unstoppable it gets spittle boring.so if you haven't bought this game yet don't cause its a waste of money
It wasn't very comfortable. It felt like it was cutting into my side at one point. Also it wouldn't stay in one place
Good salsa and lyrics ok. Good to lessen to on a sunny day. Also to relax with good friends. Enjoy and have fun.
I expected just a little bit more of this movie. I found it to much exaggeration. None the less, ok to watch. enjoy it!!!
This was a CD Birthday present and I had it mailed to my sister born in 42.  I did not hear the music!
This was given as a present for my sister born in 51 I mailed  it to her. I did not hear it! The sender sent it to me rather than my sister. Perhaps I made an error when ordering.
Great quality! Applies so gently and smooth :) I had to apply two coats for the black to be pigmented!
This game is much more challenging than it appears to be at first. I love the use of tools to help get players from one level to another. The &amp;#34;out-of-the-box&amp;#34; thinking that is required is enjoyable and challenging. However, only one hint is provided at each level, and it is not always helpful. Since there is no other strategy guide, going online for help is a nuisance. It is also frustrating to have to begin each level from the start when you  repeatedly get burned or eaten, etc.
Already showing signs of wear and I have only had it a week. The edges are already chipping off as well.
The story was cute, semi-predictable.  The low rating is due to the ending. I honestly didn't see it coming, not in the twist of a story kind of way but that it just ended.  I felt like the ending came out of nowhere. I actually went back a page to make sure I didn't somehow skip to the end or something.
It was all bent out of shape it works but not that well... Wow word requriments really im not too happy
Formal dress at a decent price, nothing exciting about it - VERY lightweight. Would be great for an outdoor summer wedding. I am tall so it was a little shorter than I had hoped but for the price you can't be too picky. The color was DEAD on and exactly the shade I needed. In the picture it looks more fitted around the middle than it was, but overall, a nice dress and again, can't complain about the price. It arrived in a soft bag like package, not a box - dress was folded in a loose clear plastic bag inside.
I used this piece to change out an old 40+ year old blank toggle cover. They do not sell this type of cover any more with the screws in the normal place of the toggle cover screws. It was easy to put in except the holes where the screws would go for the new toggle cover were not pre drilled. I had to screw the screws in the make room and the toggle cover doesn't fit as snuggly as a I like. The room looks better especially with matching toggle and outlet covers.
This was a good book, definitely worth reading. I just wish the author hadn't switched so much between the past a present, made things a little confusing but once you get past that it has a good plot and character substance.
The book story line was good but the ending was cut way too short. It doesn't even seem to be a set up for a sequel. I just prefer to have more to the story.
I have special issues so for me it's just ok.  With an orthodic insert it is working better.  The shoe has a flat sole (bottom) which is not good for my walking issue.
I LOVE this bracelet, I received it promptly however I wore this for no more than 30 minutes and the lace detached from the bracket :( I had to stitch and super glue it back together. It was salvageable and for that I am grateful!
dissappointed....... fragrance does not linger for long eventhough it states that it is perfume!!.... Don't think that I would purchase it again!!
number very small, the glass brocken just with a littel hit even in not shap object. to change the date is very diffucult ect.
IT HELPS TO HAVE EXTRA OF THESE BUT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET MULTIPLES OF THESE BUT ONLY GOT ONE BUT I USE IT AS BACK UP
I love crosswords andThats why I got it.would like some more books of similar kinds to work on.
Part of the Davao won't stay on the wall. I like it, but disappointed it won't stay on the wall.
It took me three of them to get on but once I got it on I absolutely loved them!!!! It works great
This book is a great idea. I love the thought and work put into it but it feels more like a rough draft than an actual book to me. It was hard to keep up with when the characters came in. They were strangers an  then it skipped a ton and they were all friends. I wish he would of explained things a lot more instead of skipped around. I also wish I knew more about what happened when the aliens came and the experience they went through at that time. A great second book would be from the people's point of view that left earth with the aliens. This book has.  Lot of potential. It was worth the read.
I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to the apps I purchase, and this app was no different. However, it did function as promised and &amp;quot;immediately&amp;quot; coverted a song I had that I couldn't listen to to a format that my Android tablet understood. I just wish it could have been a stand-alone on-tablet app instead of an upload/download kind of thing.
Moringa leaf capsules , I have been take them for 1 month and haven't seen any be difference in them so far,will continue to take see if gets better  performance .
This could have been spectacular but there is no-one narrating through the entire 1 1/2 hrs.Therefore, we don't know what we're seeing in alot of cases.Especially hotels.How are we supposed to do research and stay there if we're not given information? Don't bother renting....specials on TV are better.
I absolutely loved this when I put it on my phone. It was very neat. Looked very nice. Came in handy having a mirror. I live in tn and it was still winter when I got it. However I just got back from sunny florida  and while there I had to take it off my phone because in the bright sun I could not see my phone when on like when in tn. Hope they come up with one that works as well in bright sun.
I got this for one reason, I own a car with leather seats in Arizona, bad business. I just wanted this to make my seats not hot and it does just that. My only complaint is sometimes it itches the back of my legs, but ohter than that its good!
Two friends become lovers... But it's unclear how long they'll be together and whether or not they're just exploring a new kind of love.
Interesting tale.  Fast paced.  Misunderstood teen.  Messed up dad.  Strange girl who,befriends him.  Sloppy Joes.  Aliens, or not.  Bullying.  The haves and the have-nots.
I like a story with more of a connection between the characters.  Perhaps as the series continues I'd feel more by in.
I heard a few songs by B.o.B. so I bought this.  I was a bit disappointed because there are really only 3 good tracks.  If I had it to do again, I would just buy those tracks.
It's great for really cleaning your hair squeaky clean but has a strong odor smell that affects my allergies. I don't understand why nature or natural claiming anything would put dyes or perfumes in their products.
This works well if you cut the onion in half or quarters but will not work well with a whole veggie etc. It's plastic so i see this in the future breaking at some point when pushing down with force, but for now it works as advertised. Has two removable sized grids which I used by itself once on a potato.  Dishwasher safe! and comes with cleaning tool for top underside.
Tried this for psoriasis and will work sometimes but did not for me even when taking the pills. This is not to be confused with oregano you cook with! this stuff is already mixed with olive oil but is not too potent.
It is smaller than full size keyboard, keys are tiny in comparison but other than that it's a keyboard to use.
It's ok up to about 180lbs, after that it becomes stiff against your end. For a heavy guy id look into memory foams or cushions with filler because this did not cut it for me. I'm using this until i can find another that works for me.
Its pretty and all but seems kinda cheap metal or plastic on back, the necklace it comes with is really cheap plastic and should be replaced by a nice leather one. But still worth the price
It's ok if you weigh about 70lbs else you will flatten it out in one sit. Not firm and not for heavy people.
Will not charge with this case on it keeps plug from connecting good I like the case nice looking thanks
I love diamond dash .! &amp;lt;3 But the only problem i have with it is that the app takes pretty much about 5 minutes to load ! And sometimes it won't even load and this app keeps freezing! This is an OUTRAGE ! But still a good app / game ! {-: ^O^&amp;lt;3
much too big for what I was needing.  It is a fine pot for herbs but a bit too big to be indoors during the winter.
tthis item was shipped in a timely manner..the 7\tablet a Zeepad fits great on the slots that holds the tablet...one thing to notice...is that...the lights don't come one at once...but after about 5 min they come on...it charges from the tablet...i purchased it for my 12 yr old girls..i am satisfied wit the purchase...
To many cliff hangers in a short peroid of time.The story didn't flow as smooth as the river and falls.
it pops off repeatedly, did not fit phone well, won't stay on this word count stuff is really really stupid
I think the book really had potential for a strong, emotional connection to the characters and their struggles. However, the main character's internal struggle with her sexuality is minimally discussed. In fact, the external conflicts are somewhat skimmed over and never resolved, so it leaves you wondering what happened in the past hour of reading. The ending comes across as if the author merely wanted to meet a page limit- no resolution, no cliff-hanger, just stuck in book limbo. The book as a whole leaves something to be desired.
These gloves are warm enough and seem pretty wind and water proof so far. The palms seem tough but the backside fabric not so much. Things that should be improved are the that the liners are loose and when you pull your hands out; the liners pull out too making it hard to put the gloves back on without some work readjusting. Also the finger tips have extra fabric on the tips making it really hard to work on anything small; I had to remove them when hanging Christmas light hooks and adjusting the volume on a car stereo can even be tricky. I always wear an XL glove and the XL in this case fits me well.
Seems like a great boot but it does not fit to size at all. Purchased an 8 but this at lest a size 9.
It was pretty good, though it wasn't my absolute favourite. I suggest Finally. That was an amazing book  that I read over and over again.
I would rate this app higher, but there is always problems when you have to update. The game updated to the Valentine's quest and now it messes up. It loads then after less than a minute it re loads. It just keeps on doing this no matter how many times you restart it. There is just so many days to complete this quest, but can't play to do it. Please fix this newest problem.
I hate how you have to pay for more chapters after chapter one. But I do like the game very much.
I mean, it's power rangers. Did you like them growing up? I didn't but then again, I have nothing against them now, so I figured I'd throw it in the collection. With what results? You get to listen to the Power Ranger theme song over and over again until you have to turn the game off. Otherwise it's kind of cool, especially if you never watched the show growing up. It's a great way to get some insight about the show.
After reviewing the Sega Cd and watching someone else play it, its safe to say that you cannot expect much from this unordinary game console. So, what did Jurassic Park have to offer that most games on the Sega Cd don't? For one it has some 3D perspectives that were pretty neat for its time, not to mention the story and quest is solid.  It's nice to hear the Dinosaur Professor teach you things about all the different Dinosaur species.  It didn't rub off on me too well at first, but it eventually grows on you, and if you have a well balanced appetite for old and new things, this game should satisfy to an extent.  The graphics are nice; very well detailed not to mention you get to use several different weapons and interact with a good variety of animals through out the game.  The fun ends there however.  The puzzles you get stuck on in this game are some of the most irritating ones ever not to mention the game takes far too long to reload when you die.  The puzzles are irritating mainly because they are all more so about timing certain sequences and find that \EXACT spot on the screen.\  That sort of stuff is what produces migraines!!!  To make matters worse, and to end this review, let's talk about the end of part three on this game.  Once you begin to find the Dinosaur eggs you need and realize they have to go in the incubator, you feel fairly confident you can get through this and finally end this rare and curious adventure. But then the ultimate glitch occurs.  You find after defeating the T Rex that next you go into a cave to pick up Raptor eggs.  You have night vision goggles and finally you can see where the heck you need to go,and it stops there. I even watched the walkthrough, which the player would not answer my question for me (???)  You approach a well where you notice a card you need to open the next door in the proceeding room.  Well, you can't reach the card; you have to throw two rocks in to raise the level, and THEN grab the card. And that's the problem.  There is no second rock in sight anywhere on the game.  I heard that perhaps in the water tunnel the second rock is around, but it's not there either.  So for me, the biggest problem with this game is you CAN'T FINISH IT.  Where the heck is 2nd rock for the well???  The game has nothing more to offer besides a few special effects that were new for the time, interesting facts, and some corky yet entertaining motion video.  Other than that, this game is a collectors item or for the birds.
Well, they just don't feel the same as normal earrings. You can feel the metal tryna go through your ear, and its a little painful. They also fall out occasionally and you might lose them if you're not careful
I like it that it's easy to install it. I wish it wouldn't vibrate as much. I tried putting the rubber inserts that it comes with but it still shakes as I drive.
Does as advertised, but not up to a mile. signal improved tough. Yes worth the cost, very cost effective. John
This poster is a good one but not really what I was looking for. The blue car didnt fit the color scheme of the room and the dark sky gives a gloomy depressed feeling. We are focusing on the \Paris Theme\ in my granddaughter's room and want to make it a fun room. She is a pre-teen and didn't care for the public display of affection.
After waiting so long for  this book to come it was not what I expected not sure what i was looking for .
These are super cute BUT way small! I usually wear a 6.5 to 7.5 . I ordered a 6.5 first , too smallSo I ordered 7.5 and again too small.  They're npt too narrow (although they are a relatively narrow shoe) just too short. My big toe is the only issue.Maybe they'll stretch.
I like the watch, but it was missing a stone on the wrist band. Didn't feel like goin through the time to get a new one.
Got this case for my Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy S2.  The looks alright but around some of the edges the sticker print is peeling right out of the package.  Real fast delivery.  The pen is pretty cool.  The screen protector is nice but they should have reversed the way you put it on because I would think you would want to match up the cut-outs first when you stick it on for the first time.  The top corner of the snap together doesn't stay snapped all the time sometimes it pops apart.  Overall the phone fits in perfect and it will save it from some damage for awhile.  Don't know if the case will stay together though if dropped.  I'm going to order an otterbox right after this review.
I just didn't care for it to much going on .Thank you to much shooting to much blood wasn't that great
He is always ready for adventure no matter where it takes him.  Protecting his people--be they two-legged or four -is his aim.
This is a book for those of us who are allowed to be &amp;#34;staff&amp;#34; to our furry task masters.  The auther has captured the esscense of living with cats.  I would reccomend this to anyone so lucky or to anyone else for a good laugh.
Rating of 3 stars is &amp;#34;average&amp;#34;  Romance readers will enjoy  the modern storyline along with the humor.  I would reccomend this book to all lovers of love.
Fit and quality is great, But I found Bali has the same type just well made at less than half the price.
The fit and color is fine,but not what I would call flannel it is bed sheet thin guess that is why the picture is set so far back, It is worth the price just know what you are realy getting.
The lace part of this dress was far longer that the picture had led me to expect. I'm 165cm and 51 kg (sorry people I'm European) and the dress (size 6) fits perfectly, but while the fabric part barely coveres my behind, the lace fell well under my knees. Frankly it made me look like someone&amp;#8217;s grandma. The dress is still beautiful and quite well made, so I decided not to send it back and had it shortened.
The book was good, it was new like it said. But there was some delivery damage on its sides so it made me sad a little.
It is used book but it did not answered my expectations, it is pretty old. Besides, there is not any missing page and it is good for study.
Fun, challenging, and addictive. Flappy Wings offers fun for any age. I recommend it for those who seek light entertainment.
The game is awesome, i have beaten it multiple times on my xbox 360. the computer game however, you need steam to play. i am in a place where i cant get downloads, so now this game is worthless.
fun so far. graphics are very good and it does not take ridiculously fast motions to have fun with this game
It is ok. It's Easy to get on,  but hard to get off. Also looks kind of faded on the sides.
The box was broken and was so dirty. One can't consider this as a gift. Stand is uneven and can't stand properly. I would never consider this for gift.
Not the best quality out there, but perfect for the price.  It was used for a fund raiser so it was exactly what we needed.
It's an ok book. I would say itsthe best one out there but it is a better one that others to read. He seems to know his stuff....
I bought this because I am willing to try anything once to help lose weight... As far as the whole weight loss since i have been taking thesee there hasnt been any, not even inches. But I do sleep SO much better at night! Soif you are having a hard time sleeping try this. But don't expect weight loss.
This suit is so incredibly cute with super bright colors and great quality. I purchased the size M and when I received the suit the top was a medium and bottoms were a large. The size medium top fits very small...would work great for a size A or B cup but larger would look funny due to the padding and underwire. I am keeping the suit because I love the color combo and I am going to try and find a matching top on my own.
The print and binding are excellent and it ever retains that odd Japanese book store smell similar to bamboo and/or a tatami mat; however, the content contains mostly Toho and Daiei monsters from the 1970's.  Strangely, this book has a Godzilla paper cut out which would make it a good child's book.  Also, the latter third of the book is devoted to fan art which appears to be drawn by child.  A very curious book indeed, but not for any serious fan of past and present Dai Kaiju movies.
I enjoy the control of wooden cotton swabs, but this brand's cotton tends to be occasionally thin at either end.  Best to check the thickness of the swab's ends before using them for health applications; otherwise, a great value.
The picture makes this box look big but its very small couldn't hold half of the make up I have! I ended up giving mine to my little cousin. If you don't have much makeup this is for you but if you have a lot I would recommend you get something else.
Of all the cases I have gotten all the reviews I read on this case, this case was the most disappointing. I didn't feel there was adequate protection with this case for the same price you could get a much more durable case, one that provides more defense against falls or drops. It's got two layers of the flimpsy rubber stuff. I might look cool and if that's what your looking for than this is your case, otherwise shop around go otterbox or a few others that's are just as awesome.
I love the game, but the cards are so small. They are kind of hard to see. That's my only complaint.
Just because someone puts a &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; on the tag, doesn't make it a wide shoe. I wear a wide New Balance shoe, and have even had my foot measured at a New Balance store, so I know how this should fit. I love the look of the shoe, but unfortunately that doesn't help make it comfortable.
Device was good but the power cord was broken so I had to order a new one and a month later I still have not recieved it. waiting on deliverly.Lino Alcala
This was such a cute outfit the jacket was adorable but the flower I was expecting to be on it was not there when it arrived. But I still love it. The shirt is cute. But the pants are not what they seem to be in the picture. I ordered for a 12 month old and the pants look like they should be for an 18 month almost 2 yr old. Other then the flower not being there and the jeans it's aborable
This is a decent cooler for its price but it could be so much better.1. Construction - As most other reviewers have stated, the construction is flimsy at best and heavy mobile use will eventually lead to an accident. Also the metal &amp;#34;incline&amp;#34; bar likes to pop out of slot sometimes wich is bad for the laptop. Also, the unit needs to be propped up on 4 &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; (i use small square wooden blocks at each corner&amp;#34; to actually get a decent airflow from the bottom.2. Fan - The fan is big, but it doesnt turn fast at all even at max. And it doesnt push that much air to your laptop. After a month of use, i can only get a 2 or 3 degree drop in CPU temperature and a 5 - 10 degree drop on VGA and HDD from this unit.3. Lighting - The red LED is nice and is the main reason i ordered this unit. I thought it would compliment my red backlit keyboard and red lights that i use to operate my computers in the dark. Well i was wrong. The LED is %100 invisible when you have a laptop sitting on the unit, and therefore is of no use at all.4. Size - This unit is advertised to fit 17&amp;#34; inch Laptops. Good luck getting a 15&amp;#34; inch to fit good on it. This unit is for Android Tablets and netbooks when it comes to size.5 - Conclusion - Do not buy! There has to be better products out there for the same price. If your set on a red LED laptop cooler, forget it because very very few Cooler LED's are visible once a laptop is sat on them. Thermaltake kicks ass just not at Laptop Coolers yet.
The sound is real great. On par wit the big name headphone companies.  Only drawback is it tends the to disconnect from my phone at the gym
The cinnamon is super strong, which I guess I should have expected. It wasn't bad but not as good as the other types I tried.
It's cute but It doesn't fit properly I feel like If I want to take it off it might break
Not sure if the keyboard works or not, like so many other reviewers, because there was NO directions telling us that we would need an adapter.  The picture is misleading because it shows the adapter with the connection.  In fact, it says to plug the connection right into the tablet.  Now I have to go get one, not a big deal if I had just known specifically that I need to order one at the same time.
steps were fast..and direction..also music was not what i expected? It is good for experienced Zumba dancers workout,but someone who is starting needs warm up and simple direction before steps-squats- ect...I got it as a start,but will try someone else.
I bought this stick was in a pinch and on a budget,i honestly am not all that pleased with the button lay out the HAT switch is off set and at least for me feels awkward.The stick is very comfortable very nice grip feel.The buttons on the base a virtually flush with the surface of the base and that means you have to look down to find them taking your eyes off the screen,anyone who flys  combat simulation knows thats NOT ideal.
The phone is already starting to have problems.  Sometimes when I text it turns itself off unexpectedly which is not good and I can only use it on speaker phone now because the outside earpiece isn't working anymore.
I got this primarily to wear under my shirt, to carry my CCL and a CCL badge my kids got me. Unfortunately it doesn't fold flat, and bulges way too much under my shirt to be any use. You can only really wear this on the outside.
So far I'm liking it but if I have to pay for every new episode I know it will be a short lived game for me because it took 3 hours to load what seems to be just one episode.
I like the smell, made my car smell better than it did before lol I plan on ordering more of this item.  Great order !
I was expecting diets or more ideas on what to eat or more ideas on how to improve egg quality thats the main reason why i bought the book
The lights were not very bright other than that they are ok I really liked the blue lights that were ordered now they are noticeable
It was as expected maybe a litlle small. However I liked it. It was unexpensive at all. I recommend it
Putting it together was easy but the quality isn't that great. I thought I would really like the double bar but without having it sideways you really can't see the clothes on the back row. The bars are adjustable so I have the front bar all the way down and the back bar up high so I can have it against the wall. I ended up having a closet built so I use this rack at our Pawn Shop and seems to work well there.
You have to have an odd sense of humor to get it but overall it's a great book. Define recommend
Cakal som ale magneticke uzatvaranie, maksi povrch a tie kvalitnejsie osvetlenie celej plochy. Najviac mi ale vadi velka vaha tohto obalu! Inak spokojnost s kvalitou materialov a so spracovanim gumy.
but the pin that it came with has rhinestones on it.  The dress got snagged on the pin and pulled a bit.  This dress is PERFECT for your pregnant body if you  are going somewhere HOT, like an outdoor wedding.  Otherwise you will definitely want a slip or something underneath.  Its nearly sheer but not quite.
Not a lot of good stories this month  but maybe there is something wrong with me..  I will try it again
As posted by reviewers before me, the book is kind of a run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. It's good, not great. It's fun to read at times, but at others it's a little painful. I would recommend it because it's free, if it weren't I wouldn't waste more than a few dollars on it. I don't know how the books after this in the series play out, but I plan on getting the next one to see how it plays out. The book has potential, now all that's left to do is see if the author acts on it. (If the author had a better editor the book could have been amazing, just sayin')
Ok, so a vlogger recommended this book and it sounded interesting. I read 75% of it in 2 days! Very interesting facts. I don't like this guys writing style. He acts as if he wants to build suspense , but it ended up being confusing and annoying at parts. Also, he leaves some relevant facts unmentioned and unaddressed. He pours an unexpected level of personal opinion into each story, tainting(in my opinion) an otherwise uninformed/unbiased reader's perception.I have my own opinions and have read much on many of his chosen subjects and have my own opinions. That said, some of the information changed my opinions but some only darkened my opinion of the author.I liked the book, though :)
Good Router for the price and Gigabit supports high data transfer for streaming deives&amp;#62; Overall I can rate as Good
Butt still hurts but not nearly as bad.  Cushion is fine just didn't solve problem. Still glad I bought it.
The top of right corner little bit unfit for the phone, but its good looking though. The price is good.
My kids liked it overall. I was disappointed with the amount if tiny pieces and a bit taken aback at how small the 2 bags were when I received it for the amount it cost. I would of liked to see some larger pieces included.
I should have trusted my instinct and bought a size B but I went with the C looking at the size chart spanx had online. Unfortunately they don't feel tight enough. Typically the higher power is firm and the material is durable but this one feels like I could rip them easily. I'm 5' 6&amp;#34; (36-29-39) and I weigh about 140. Shipping was fast and amazon was great I just should have bought a smaller size. The best part of the spanx design is the open gusset although I never use it for what its intended for...it's a good feature though.
Didn't enjoy this story as much as I thought I would. Vampires are not really my thing but I thought I would give it a go.and in parts I found it boring and didn't seem to get into it as much as the cover pic promised. My mistake because I known you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
Run of the mill, an okay read but boring like the author has run out of new material. Wont buy again
I would rate it just okay - it does have some good recipes in it but some of the ingredients are in &amp;#34;british&amp;#34; english and I don't know what they mean, i.e. crumpets (I now know that mean english muffins)  but other ingredients are just baffling to me.
I ordered this because I liked the design. Well in this picture you can see the shadow design really good but that's not the case with the one I received. I can barely see it at all on mine. Very disappointed by that. But does fit good on my phone and works to protect it.
Hi everyone I noticed this scooter has a lot of good reviews,and that's great.but I had a razor scooter just like this and it broke in about a week.Today I got a new scooter at elite bicycles in citrus heights and I love it go get a scooter there they are great!!!!!!
this bar is ok.  just received it.  screws were missing, found some comparable but dont trust it at all. my hubby is 6'5\ and he bumps his head on it so i have to remove it after every use.  He suggested it would have been great to have brackets that are open at the top so you could slid the bar up and down to remove and install.  What a great idea.  Too bad i did see another bar i was going to buy that was just like that.  Again, bad decision on my part and I'm out 23 bucks
It was a great case for the price. But it eventually stretched out &amp; I only had it for about a month. I recommend it for a temporary case.
This is an okay bag, but I was looking for more storage space. There are only a few departments to store items. Other organizers have more slots for storage. This would work for smaller purses. Its nice, but not as nice as the others that are on the market for purse organizers.
Featured as it is!!  Perhaps value is a bit too much considering the textile/garment of the costume.  Shipped on time just for Halloween!!
This product works OK for the green screen effect, but the size listed is not true. It is most likely the UNFINISHED size. The size is a little smaller than advertized. I would recomend this product but just be aware that it is not 10X20 as advertized.
I'd give this a fourth star if it were edited better. The overall content was good. Being a believer in herbs made this read a simple one. It covers the basics and is organized well.  I would like to have seen the use of the Latin names especially for plants like passion flower, horsetail since they are several species within the genera. But overall all an honest 3.5 start book. Enjoy!
A good magazine and the first one I've read by these folks. I enjoyed the message and the knowledge. The article on the awning was excellent. I loved that the pictures were accessible, letting me zoom in and out. I'll get more of these I think.
The book is large (coffee table size.) I was expecting a normal size book.  In this format, it's hard to hold and read. The pictures are very good, and if it was mostly pics and little text, it would be a winner as a coffee table book.  The title is correct; it is a compilation of essays (reflections) by other people on Oprah's success.
Cute shoe, they fit fine, I like the colors.....BUT after maybe 6 months 2 holes formed in the mesh by my little right toe. Not so happy about that.
I really enjoyed this book except for the frequent use of the f word. I rate this book a star rating of 3.
Visual and hilarious character development. The description of the attitude of the town folk is spot on. Bertie is wonderfully written; vivid personality. She could definitely be the grandmother of someone I know.
I bought these headphones because of the low price and also because of the fact that they were turtle beach they worked fine the first day I had them I could talk to other players and they could talk to me however the next day I adjusted them and went to put them on and a small piece of plastic holding the left speaker on snapped right now I have it taped on and am using these temporarily until I can purchase a better headset if it wasnt for theFact of how cheaply these were built these would be fantastic the speakers are great and so is the microphone but it is just to flimsy and fragile and break to easily I would reccomend turtle beach x12 or x32 they are much more expensive but the quality is much better
Bought it for my Azus tablet so far works good. Its not 'bulky'or 'rubbery' so its not a hassel to deal with.
Okay, up until the last chapter, this book was pretty standard with a little twist in it. A girl on the run from something or someone, meets a hot, very rich guy on the plane that is instantly obsessed with the girl, but has his own issues and past. And then the last chapter threw a one big twist in my face that leaves me with one giant questionmark.Escaping Reality is about Amy Bensen. Amy has gone through something in her past and now she's running for it. New name, new home, new life. And while running again after six years of peace, she meets Liam Stone on the plane. He's a very handsome, very rich and very talented architect. And he's instantly obsessed with Amy. They start a passionate affair, but Amy keeps doubting if she can trust him at all.Like I said before, this book is pretty Fifty Shades-like in the beginning. Except for the big mystery behind Amy herself, which I'm still figuring out after finishing the book. The writing was okay, the story was... yeah standard. The only thing that makes it a bit different from all the other books in the genre is the mystery behind Amy. Which, luckily, is enough to keep my interest up, but after a while, that stops. Nothing really happened until the very end and that wasn't enough in my opinion. Yeah sure, it gives me some questions, and I do want to know the answers, but still...The characters were.... Okay? Liam is very Christian-like and basically, I'm getting sick of that type. Rich, hot, issues from the past, obessed with the main girl for some reason,... Honestly, if I were in those situations as those girls in the books are when they meet the rich, hot guy, I'd run away from them. I don't need some obsessed guy who wants to own me. So no, I didn't really like him. As for Amy... Well she was somewhat the same as the girls in the other books. They throw back feminism by hundreds of years and I don't like that for one bit.So basically it's pretty standard and despite that, I do want to read the sequel because I need answers to those questions. I recommend this book to people who love Fifty Shades of Grey and other books like that.
Actual Rating: 3,5 starsSing and the darkness will find you.With a sentence like that on the cover I was totally prepared to read an awesome book with some cool action and a kick-ass heroine. But... I expected to much because, although I liked it quite a bit, I still feel like it let me down. And I would've liked to know that the story takes place a few centuries ago. Between 1667 and 1669. Maybe that sounds stupid, but I like that kind of information beforehand. Not that it matters a lot in what time the story takes place, it's just a detail that's important to me.First of all, I liked the characters in this story. Lucy and every other character in it matter. How small their part may be, they're all important and I like that. So many books have characters that don't really help the story and are unnecessary, this one didn't. So that's a good thing. I wanted to see a little more from the villain though... We meet him once in the entire book and I can't even remember his name right now... He didn't really leave a big impression on me. The Shadowgrims are cool but they also don't play a big role yet. Maybe we'll get to see more of the bad guys in the sequel? Let's hope so!The story is well thought out. I do believe the author really took some time to work it all out, so that is good. But although it's interesting and quite original, is so slow. I would've liked to see more action, instead most of the book lucy is underground, hiding and training. Love the character developement we get from that, but it gets boring after a couple of hundred pages. I wanted more action! What I do like about that is the romance. It builds nice and slow. it's more realistic and it's not a big part of the story yet. But I think it will be in the books that follow. They probably shouldn't have called it romantic in the blurb, because it isn't that romantic yet.So this is a pretty good book and fans of the genre might like it. If you want a nice relaxing read, I recommend it as well. If you love books that move to the action quick, I wouldn't recommend it because this isn't one of those book. I really hope we get more action in the next book. The cover is awesome though.
I liked this book. The story was good, the characters also goo, the writing good. I was pleasantly surprised, to be honest. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.. I didn't really connect with the characters though... I don't know why... Even so, this was a nice read and maybe I will read it again in the future, who knows? I will be reading other books by this author for sure.I loved getting to know Maine. I didn't really knew that much about it, so I was happy to get such depth and detail of it's history, landscape and all that. I really loved that!Another thing I loved was the mystery in this book and how it unfolded. Maybe it's a weird thing to say, but I predictable but unpredictable. My head hurts trying to figure that one out. xDSo this is a good book and I liked it. But it wasn't more then that for me. Good, but not great. That's why I gave it 3.5 stars. Good job A.D.! I look forward to read more from you in the future.
3.5 starsI'm surprised to say that I really liked this book! It was a pretty cool and original concept and it worked out well. I found a few typos, but they didn't bother me that much. Kimberly gives her own spin on mermaids and sirens and mixed that with some cool action, fantastic underwater scenes and a passionate romance.Waterborn is about Caris. She just moved to a little town near the sea from Kentucky with her dad and she can't help but feel different here. Like the sea is calling her. And then she meets Noah, not knowing what he is. Noah is a waterbreather and he hears Caris' song in his head and he can't help but feel attracted to her. Soon enough, Caris finds out what and who she is. But is that really who she wants to be?The writing in this book was very good. I couldn't put this book down once I picked it up. I was pulled into Caris' world and wanted to find the answers to her questions just as much as she did. The story was cool and I got just the right amount of action and in the end my questions were answered. The romance was so sweet and passionate at the same time, I couldn't get enough of it.But despite the fact that there was some action, I never felt like it was enough. I kept waiting for something big, but it never really happened. And that took a bit from the story for me. I wanted more.I really liked Caris, she was a cool main character, but sometimes she annoyed me quite a bit. I can't even tell you why because I don't know. Maybe the way she acted around Noah in the beginning? And I liked Noah, he was sweet and he had some issues to deal with. And I got that. And it wasn't really insta-love between him and Caris because of the whole siren-song thing. I didn't like Sol and Pax, obviously. I loved Maggie and Erin and Caris' dad. I'm a bit conflicted about Athen, though. I'm not sure if I should like him or hate him.Overall, this is a good mermaid-ish story. Kimberly gave her own spin on it all and that was pretty cool but I finished the book wanting more. So yes, I have yet to find a book in this genre that completely blows my socks off. But I do recommend it, maybe you like it more than I did.
Still interested in utopia worlds? Then this book is for you. For me? No, thank you. Utopia books make me wanna shout \wake up\!The more I read about utopia societies, the more I love this world and the more it seems to be the best world to live in. Just finished reading the book The City Of The Sun by Tommaso Campanella and it really seems like a copy of Utopia by Thomas More, which I read couple months ago. The style of writing and the way author express himself through the material is very interesting considering the century it was written. Though, Tommaso was absolutely familiar with the More's treatise Utopia, and the style of both books is similar not accidentally. Sincerely, I like the \original\ Utopia more.If you still don't consider our world to be utopia and still dreaming about living in those fiction utopias it's a great book for you to read. What really made me think reading this book is that Tommaso builds his City of the Sun on the society he actually lived in. It seems that utopia is just what actually exists but everything that is considered bad is removed and everything considered good is magnified. That's it, nothing more nothing less. Moreover, the religion is exaggerated what is strange having in mind modern utopias that really denies religion. But having in mind the century the book was written (more than 400 year ago), probably it's the norm.In addition, The City Of The Sun really look like a mix of the modern days authors' books' The New Brave World and 1984. Not considering technologies, just taking the society's lifestyle and traditions, it really looks having characteristics similar to both of the modern novels. And still I don't love the robotized society. Even though the book describes happy people, I still don't see any personalities and any sense of their existence, but probably that's the point of utopia world.I just want to make some analogues to our world. One of them is that society in the book is so busy doing everyday activities that people don't even have time to realize themselves and their actual needs or existence. They are blindly following the order of the state, the formed needs and formed happiness. Sadly, but our world is the same. Most people are so busy doing everyday routine activities, following formed opinions and needs that are basically not their own. It seems the same robotic. The good thing is that in our world we can wake up, we have everything we need to do so and if utopia dreams doesn't make you more robotic, if you feel somehow that you need to escape from sleeping life, one of the best books to read is Why You're Dumb, Sick and Broke...And How To get Smart, Healthy and Rich by Randy Gage.If you have some additions or different opinion, please, share and discuss it together!
They were very stylish to each outfit i used them with. They were very cool i liked them a lot.
My 14 year old grandson must have ordered this. I'll have to ask him if he found his LOVE MATCH
like the style of this shirt  but too big
again find this shirt fits too big  would have liked to try on first  one of the disadvantage of purchasing on line
Got this case before I realized that it doesn't fit the Kindle Fire. Very disappointed about that. Shipped from Hong Kong, so not gonna return. I'm sure it's a great little case for the tablet it's supposed to fit!!
Cute but lost its color after one use. Will purchase again maybe I will put clear polish next time first.
when I first started taking this it seemed to be working pretty well. I lost 5 pounds in about 2weeks, but I also eat very healthy and I work out almost daily.  So that  didn't exactly send me to the moon or anything but it was definitely encouraging. I started out taking the 3pills a day like it says, and I got SEVERLY constipated. So I cut back to one a day and slowly worked my way back up. The consipation comes and goes now but its There more often than not. I've been taking this product now for almost a month and not only have I not lost an ounce, I gained back the 5 pounds that I lost. It doesn't seem to be doing anything at all at this point. Which is dissapointing because I have struggled with my weight for so long even though I eat right and exercise so I thought this could be the answer I was searching for but sadly, i have found that the old saying holds true, if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. I will continue to take the pills until they are gone just in case I suppose but overall I'm not really pleased. Especially for the $$
Overall not a bad product.  Wish it came with the garter hosiery.  The arm bands are pretty weak  but overall,  it's OK.
Somewhat predictable, but historically and geographically accurate, good story lines with families and cross family developments, recommend for a light reading.
I had to read for school didn't really care too much about the content. Hopefully I pass the class so I can graduate
it is addictive game just wish it had power-ups like some of the other bingo games but other than that its a good game
The concept is cool and the distance on the remote is pretty good. It's not very loud, but the vibration is also kind of weak. Not a horrible toy, but definitely not worth the price.
I thought the color was pretty. A very bright neon pink. However, I do not feel this brand is equally comparable to Gelish brand polish. This seemed to peel off very easily, which is a problem I never really have with Gelish.
IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO RECEIVE A BATTERY OF 4400, INSTEAD OF THE ONE ORDERED ACCORDING TO THE ONLINE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION WHICH SPECIFIED 7000 mAH. SO THE CAPACITY OF THE BATTERY RECEIVED WAS ALMOST HALF OF THE ONE PURCHASED ACCORDING TO THE ADVERTISED PRODUCT. NEVERTHELESS, I ENDED VERY SATISFIED FOR THE MERCHANT IMMEDIATE AND POSITIVE RESPONSE TO MY CLAIM. I WISH TO IMCREASE MY EVALUATION TO THREE STARS NOT TO THE ITEM BUT TO THE MERCHANT IN RECOGNITION TO HIS GOOD ATTITUDE.
This is a bit of history and is interesting how Hollywood and the people there got caught up in crazyness!
This toy was the least favorite of the toys that my child received for Christmas. In theory this is a great idea, but in reality they are kind of limiting. If you like blocks like we do, then it is a fun &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; to have in your block collection. But if your funds are limited, just get a really good block set with lots of blocks. Your kids will then have no limits. Or try Keva planks.....those are way cool!
We received this item today, we liked the look of the case and fit the phone really good, would have gave it 5 stars if the belt clip had been in our package. The belt clip was one o the reason we ordered it
Instructions were not detailed or specific and I'd never put one of these together before so it took me a little while to figure it out. It was simple once I did though. Somewhat wobbly, but we don't play too often and just wanted something cheap to keep the keyboard off the floor.
It ve' been a good purchase...But I don't know if it working...AnywayI like it...I hope it does and I'll buy again...
I bought this just for the thread for bobbins as I bought others for the rest of my sewing on my machine.
The pins are to long,  But the pin colors help me to know where to sew and with what color to sew with.
I would rate it higher, but the wheel for it is made of plastic.  Won't last long at all if you have a dog with any kind of strength.  They get going on the trolley and that thing will break when it hits the end if they have anything besides a fast walk going on or if they pull really hard.  I had to go to the hardware store and buy a metal one.
On top of the fact that all of the corners were mushed, on the back cover there's a huge gash in the bottom right corner. ugh, that's so dissapointing. I'm contemplating returning it for a new copy. But for now, the disks are fine and I guess it'll do.
It's cheap and not made well, it keeps coming off and I've already lost the back of one of them, they don't grip the phone very well but for $.01 and free shipping I'd buy it again and again and again and again~
Does not fit 2005 Audi S4 convertible as a break light. If you are looking for it Sylvania 7225 fits
It keeps leaking!  The water tastes good.  It was easy to install, just don't know why I can't get it to stop leaking!!
this is a beautiful shoe but unfortunately too small.  more like a size 9.5 than a 10 US.  the vendor did not place a receipt in the box so not sure how to return it...
This was a birthday gift for my son.  He said it did not have a memory card in the camera.  Perhaps this was my error in not realizing this when I ordered the camera since  I have purchased other cameras and the card was included.  Otherwise this was a good choice for him.  Thank you.  Linda Lucas
Just ok!
this glue bonds a bit faster than the ones I'm used to, but that may just be getting more experienced in using it.However, it gets VERY hot for a few second when it dries, like a burning feel hot! If you have sensitive nails, get glue then dries cooler!
It's a good story that I reall all the way through. I could take or leave it, love S.C.'s Thoughtless series though!
It is a good game but unless you buy it, you don't get to play much of it. Would have liked to see more before planning on buying.
its ok I mean it has more than 20 settings. but the vibration is weak. Its more to get you aroused than to get you off. If someone where sensitive then yeah this would probably work for them. this is for four play
makes a little noise on recording playback. there is what appears to be a constant noise. Would get from another maker.
This was super cute, and my daughter loved it!  However, one of the little legs broke apart the minute I took it out of the package :-/  I super glued it back on!
Very good but then it breakIt was cheap Was $4.30 now I can't listen to music in my car all day
The item worked great but I found it quickly became useless if, like me, you plan to build a stash of milk. It just doesn't hold enough bags. With full 5oz bags it might hold 10.
I expected that I was buying rooster feathers, but when I got them they were not feathers at all, but more like hair extensions - i'd rather buy something like this at Hot Topic.
well like most divers, lost my snorkel. the mask is good. At some places it does have those pointy left over plastic that is going to rub against your face and might hurt but once you use a pair of scissors and remove it; you are good to go. The snrokel came loose and i lost it.
Too bulky however quality of material and workmanship was great. For someone who does not care about size of case
it look very different from the picture than real life. It is a bit smaller and kind of look like a girl bracelet insteand
It came in a little bit late but not too early too and i thought it might be bigger but its ok
Not bad,but not that good.Cheap price and not bad quality.I like it. but  not so much.Recommand to the poor like me lol
It was simple to assemble and light weight. The only down fall: you have to be careful in how you pack it in the vehicle or where you put it (I thought I was careful), but when it came to taking it out for use (the back part of where the baby sits) curved in (toward the back of my baby) and so did the flap at the bottom of the stroller (where things are stored), also the storage at the bottom (it's hard to fit anything in there. I don't leave it in my vehicle (so it couldn't have been because of the Texas heat). But other than this, I like the stroller. Since there were no reviews when I bought this, I took my chances... If I can go back, I would have bought another one that I was looking into.
The first person voice was well crafted. I enjoyed meeting Big Pete. His cell mate, however, could have been crafted with a Littleton detail. Overall, I certainly enjoyed this book.
This is an ok read if you are bored. It is Short. Not good if you want something interesting or imaginative.
The straps underneath the foot are uncomfortable, but then I was thinking that maybe that's to be expected.  Otherwise, they fit well.  I am a size nine/ten shoe in women's depending on the brand name and the x-large fit me very well.  I am happy with the shoe overall.
Very comfortable material. Wish they sold this as a separate top and separate pants. Pants were true to size. Top fit too snug. Unfortunately, I'll have to return it.
I want to like it so much, but I just can't do it. It is way too bulky. It is 6 1/4 inches wide and 8 3/4 inches long, in my opinion that is just way too bulky. I really need it so I am going to keep it, since I always get yelled at that there is no toilet paper. I will update in a few months if it rusts or anything changes.
the charger slot doesnt fit the charger, so I have to take it off the phone every time I need to charge it.
Not my favorite, but still awesome and pretty amazing considering their age and the fact that they hadn't been a band in over 30 years
Again, a beginner so I don't speak for quality but they work just fine! They did seem to come loose but I don't know if that's just a trait of cheap boots??
They sell it at Walmart in camping area no difference in material at all. Price not far off but this product is made well.
Not a bad read. Better than l thought. I did figure it out about half way through. All in all it kept my attention for the duration of this book.
This book was well written. Mrs. Gray took me through the pain of losing a child and the joy of finding him again through others.
I loved the look of it but I wish I would have got a larger size. It is still very cute though.
This is a great pastime for my kids.... We travel a lot so this little game is a good way to pass the time.
Haven't used it yet, but the last one lasted about 4 months.  My parents leave the TV on all the time. Does that effect the warrenty time?
I can't wait to read the next book about the Anderson family they ate men who love hard and strong
like reviewers said...armhole is not &amp;#34;the best fit&amp;#34;. But i love the length, love the color and the clothe is soft...i recommend it if you dont care much about your underwear showing a bit.
Ok I really love the shoes and I'm a bit surprise as I red that indigo line run small.true to size but there is something with the toe box that I can't define..And no kiddin' I think it will be beautiful on small feet. Not mine (10M)...It looks weird.I'm so sad coz' I heeeart the design!
I received the phone case on time as expected. Although I was somewhat upset that 5 of the crystals had already fallen out. I suspect this is either from poor handling while shipping, or poor gluing from the company. The color of the case is wonderful and all my friends ask where I bought it. I love the leopard design and fur texture, but really wish the crystals weren't falling out so quickly. Recommended for young to teenage girls for any event!
I got a surprise with this set of stories, story line great, but  the sex was a bit much . I guess i am  just a little too old to enjoy that much sex or is that I am too tired.  sigh but the story was good.
I bought this cage for my two chinchillas because i wanted to put them together and have them be in a bigger can they were currently in. But when i recieved the package the first time not only were many of the parts rusted but they were bent or broken so i had to return it for another one. When I recieved the second one, it was still damaged but I wasn't going to return it because I had waited long enough to recieve it. Most of the problems I had to fix on my own which cause assembly to take longer than nessecary.But once it was assembled, it looked great and my chinchilla Coco (the other one passed unfortunately before he got to experience the cage) loves the cage. Its spacious and gives her alot of exercise room that she doesn't even know what to do with it.If i could have I wish I could have requested a fragile sticker or something on it in order to ensure the product is tampered with.
much quieter than a Hyundia that I purchased from amazon several years ago, a big mistake.reaches pressure quickly. I only use to blow out, so can't speak for how it works with tools
I chose 3 stars because it was hard to mount on the wall. It was crooked when I received it. But I made it work. Plus wish it came with the bottles that fit in because the ones I have are too small and topple over. I mean you can fit any spice bottles in it but the bottle are sold separately which I don't feel like paying $30 for spice bottles.
I love bats. So in turn I have tried to teach my kids to love them. Most kids love to learn big words. At 2 to 3 yrs old they knew what echo location. I realize this book was meant as an overview but come on, telling someone that a bat sees with their ears and then not to tell them how they do it is just poor story telling.
size was not stated in ad so I assumed they were the size from the eye doctor.  They were quite a bit smaller which limits what they can be used for.
I think it has very valuable contents, very useful for medicine students who want to learn antimicrobials.I don't like the one page format, because if you want to study a table, you need to see the left column and the upper crow of the table. With the actual format you can't see both, because the tables are divided in two parts. Also you can't read it in a iphone, if you want to see it in the hospital, for example.
These sandals are VERY cute, don't get me wrong, I just didn't expect them to be so cheaply made. They definitely can't be used for every day walking, but if you just want them to look cute, they're great. They were alright for how much I paid for them though so I can't complain too much.
Certain areas broke off and the two layer case was a bit awkward fitting together.  Real nice rubbery feel to it and good camo.
Ok...not as good as others ive read.
I gave this book a three because it wasn't very long and it was 4 dollars .I think it should be a novel
Just received my Wright Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case - Pack 2, and I must say it's a good idea, but the carrying case needs to be about a 1/8\ longer to hold my syringe, which is filled with 50 units of insulin.  In the information, listed in fine print it does state that the case will hold up to 49 units, but the most insulin I could get into my syringe, and be able to fit inside the case was 48 units of insulin, again it's a good idea, but the case should be about an 1/8\ longer to accommodate a full 50 unit syringe, again the information states that it fits my size syringe, and it does, but it will not accommodate the full length of my syringe when filled with insulin to it's full 50 units capacity, the case will only accommodate a syringe with up to 48 units of insulin.  I am thinking about drilling a small hole in the end of the carrying case, which then would allow me to fill my syringe to the full 50 units of insulin I need. I do recommend this Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case, but it does need to be about 1/8\ longer, so I can only give it a (3* Rating).Note: Update - I was using a BD 1/2 cc syringe which at full capacity holds 50 units of insulin, and it would not fit the case it was too long when full, so I upgraded to the next larger diameter syringe, a BD 1 cc capacity, and it holds my full 50 unites of insulin, and fit's the pen case without any problem. \Syringe fit Problem Solved\ !
For the money paid I guess this Cleaning kit is OK, but the wooden box it come with is not of high quality, (crooked rear mounted hinge, and smeared stain, or paint on the top lid, also the kit I received states 42 pieces, and not 35 pieces as the sellers ad stated, so I guess it depends on how they count the included items in this kit, again the gun cleaning kit is OK, but nothing special, not of high quality, but for the money I guess it's an OK kit.
This Bowie Knife is made using quality materials, and is certainly worth the price the seller is asking, but I can only give it a 3 star rating because the craftsmanship is lacking in the final knife product, it's a shame because this could be a very fine knife, one which would give any purchaser pride in owing it, but again what it offers in quality materials it lacks in craftsmanship.  I would have been happy to pay more if the the quality of the craftsmanship was better, but at it's current price it's still a good buy.
It was not easy to read, it had a lot of scientific theory's and words that I was. Not familiar with and I think it would be better for people who have a background in science.
This book has some great points, the only thing I don't like is when books have you read only a chapter a day, somehow on books like this I get distracted half way through. I will continue to read it. One great thing I do like is that is has a scripture for each chapter.
Basically, nothing really great to point out, other than a heavy base so larger, heavier cans don't tip it. Other than that, a basic can opener that seems solid and durable (so far).
Interface not so easy, and the load time is slow as molasses. Other than that, it works fine and the price was decent. Can't report on the 3D functionality since I don't have devices for that yet, but nice to know it has it when I am ready to go that route. Slim, light, looks good. Recommended.
It's not what I remember as a kid. It actually creeps me out more now, but it's not a bad movie.
it is a good story but it seemed at times to be a little jumpy. Also, the proof reader should considere a career change.
Does the job able to listen to music while walking hands free. Reduce to risk of people noticing an iPhone that can be snatched.
this product was what it was described as, however, for the price plus the shipping price it should have been more in quantity. The option to buy in bulk should be available, all else was fine, the seller was great in responding my doubts and the product arrived in very short time.
I like the wig, but the curls are a little messy. I may use it for my Gatsby party but my own curled hair might be cuter.
I liked the game, I love doing hidden object games.  Just was over too soon, without an option to play again with different objects to find.
The book was a good book.  l have always like Dolly and thought it would be interesting to read about her dreams.  The only thing I didn't like is the book read too quickly.  It was too short.
The mats are great, the only issue is that in the picture you can see two holes... in real they don't have them!...
I think she'll use it in one year or so :) But she like it a lot. The quality looks good
I had a hard time installing this item. ended up returning it. I am not giving it a 1 star because I never really ended up using it. But I did have a hard time installing it.
Item worked for about 2 weeks. cheap quality item. I am giving it a 3 star because while it worked, it was a nice item. too bad it didn't last too long.
I am normally happy with Swiss Miss hot chocolate when it comes in the normal packets. However, the Keurig seems to water down the hot chocolate or they do not put enough mix in the cup. I would suggest brewing it on the smaller cup setting to get stronger hot chocolate.
The shoes arrived with the toe smudged a little missing the color, but I was happy to find some cute boots in a wide width in my size. Although they are supposed to be wide with shoes, they're cut the same as a regular shoe. The reason wny the shoes were narrow is because I was shipped a 12B US when I ordered a 12W. I normally go up a size in boots, so that was fine for me. I only wish they had more cushion in the shoe. I would have actually liked to have gotten what I ordered, but I still like the shoes. They have poor shock absorption, and would be better if they came as a platform. So the shoe is comfortable after wearing them all day, but your feet hurt because it's like you walking around all day on concrete even if the office has carpeting and you're wearing thick socks.
Enjoyed watching Jennifer and Rutger in their youth. Like the wardrobe, timeplace and scenery. Will not recomend for people under 17 yrs of age. Violent for its time.
It's a good book but it scares you more than it helps you.
I wanted to try these and compare to the Kind bar.While the flavor is ok they are not as satisfying or a big.I would not buy these again.
Fabric was the exact print of what I was looking for. Although the description says it was cotton, it was more like a lcanvas n a rough material, so that was a little misleading. It was sufficient for the project I needed it for but had I been makin something else wouldn't have work since it was more like a canvas than cotton
a little cheep and have had to put the binoculars back together a few times, flashlight isnt great but we just use it for pretending games, shadow puppets, and reading books in the dark so it works for us.. everything is basically ok, not good or great just kinda it will do.. it is def more for pretending and playing not so much for actual use of them
I'm not too pleased because this item comes with clips to keep wires in place they were easily detached and lost and can't find replacements in white
The story plot was good and the characters believable.  Their relationship could have been fleshed out more if the story were longer.
I'm not sure why!  It started out as a new book with a great plot but the sex scenes were almost word by word the same.
The acting was OK, and the filming.  However, I was very disappointed that they alter a number of Biblical stories in details.  I had hoped to use this in one of my missions classes at the college level, but the alterations prevent that.  Sadly, by altering several items, they lose the true impact the Bible gives.  Man seems always to be trying to better the Bible, and it cannot be done.
When certain scenes were changed to make them more dramatic, such as the end of the story, it is very disappointing.  The idea of forgiveness is absolutely key, and should be really as it is.
Used on Glock and is ok but not padded inside and is kinda tough to get pistol in and out of even with laser light accessory on bottom. Good once you get used to it i guess but still for quick draws i prefer Mikes nylon or leather type.
It did not bother my allergies at all! It works like a strong gel hold, but the only thing i found fault was i have dark hair and at the end of the day it dried into flakes if touched and made my hair look like dandruff. It holds as a gel but needs R&amp;D on flaking apart.
Good god paul anderson, i am a long fan of resident evil and your lovely wife Milla but this film kinda sucked. It did take alot from the game some but some of the action scenes were cheesy, and i could tell some makeup on zombies was poor. The story line seems all messed up as well and was confusing from the start, milla falls in water wakes up in umbrella.....fights and kills the main guy from last movie but yet at ends fights on his side and now given the t-virus again?? I can see that this is leading up to going back to the hive to fight the &amp;#34;changed appearance&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;red queen&amp;#34;. Why could you not leave some things as they are. kudos on milla still pulling off her hotness but in the last film please paul get help!
It goes on easy enough and holds up easy enough, but the drawback i found was it holds grease and finger prints easily and does not wipe clean easily. Causes rainbow effect once dirty or greasy also.
Doesn't bother my allergies and smells good. Cleans hair fairly well and holds up all day, although you can tell its natural and not chemically fortified so you get what you get with natural shampoos.
The wipes themselves are tough enough to do the job but don't tug too hard out of the container or else they will tear apart &amp;#34;what makes them flushable indeed&amp;#34;. The container is really nice but is kind of awkward in that the wipes come from the side instead of the top. The lid that comes down has a rubber ring to keep moisture in &amp;#34;it promotes&amp;#34; but yet the lid doesn't snap very well down. As far as on your bum, the paper is soft and ample size. I can see this paper type being way more flushable than some others out there.
It's ok i guess it seems to work more than Kaspersky at controlling your pc and life. I don't like how long it takes customer service to get back with you and some features on it doesn't make sense and other parts are lacking. More intrusive than kaspersky but again i think the Romanian side is more advanced than the russian side of AV.
My order arrived within the same week which was a big plus. I was alittle hasty keeping my fingers cross hoping I didnt get jipped.  The life of the ink seems to be lasting its expected time. Being that I'm using the cartridge for my work. Only problem is the quality of the ink is not very good. Its not as black as a brothers or hp cartridge its more of a faded to charcoal gray color, for me and my customer's its no biggie though. You can't beat the price.
The charging station works well with our remotes (Nintendo and generic). I like that it plugs into the usb port on the console. However the battery packs do not hold their charge very long (maybe an hour max). Still better than buying a ton of AA batteries.
The screen protect itself seems to be durable and will last awhile, but it did not fit correctly it was too long so I had to trim it to fit my zeki 10.
Bought this for my fiance's phone and he says it's alright. It does obstruct the buttons a bit, it's a little hard to press what you want as the bottom part of the case protrudes too far upward but in general... It's alright. It will do lol.
Norton 360 becomes inactive when the computer is put into standby.  I have to restart the computer many times each day to reactivate.  Spent approximately 6 hours on the telepnone with Norton support trying  to correct the problem.  However, support was never able to come up with a solution.  According the the Norton forums, many people are having similar problems with Norton 360.
El libro me ha enganchado, pero me esperaba mas trama. Se hace demasiado predecible y facil el final. Todo demasiado bonito!!!
So... this did not come with instructions in english. Haha I ended up having to match the Japanese (?) letters as if they were symbols to the directions we were given. It looks really nice on my wall and I get a lot of compliments, but the assembly was a complete headache.
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT BUT WORTH IT! IT IS VERY FUNCTIONAL FOR COFFEE TEA OR ANYTHING ELSE NEEDED TO KEEP WARM.
CUTE COLORS, GOOD STUFF, MY WIFE IS VERY AGREE WITH THEM AND THE SETTING IS GOOD.RECOMMEND THE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE.IS GOOD.
For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]Calla Tor is a young Guardian of the Nightshade pack. As the alpha of the pack, she always knew one day she would have to mate with the alpha from the other pack, Ren Laroche from the Bane pack, to form a new pack and continue to protect Vail's sacred sites for the Keepers. One day on patrol, she encounters a human boy being attacked by a bear. Against the pack laws, she saves his life and in the process reveals to him the existence of werewolves. But when she sees him at school as a transfer student the next day, she knows everything will change.Love triangles everywhereA love triangle, again. I love it! We have on one side Ren, the handsome alpha male, and on the other side Shay, the beautiful human boy. Who wouldn't want to be in Calla's position and have these two guys after her? I loved the contrast of the two relationships, how with Shay it was sweet and with Ren more intense and physical. They each have something different to offer to Calla. I think I'm team Ren, but I'm not sure yet. I found Calla and Ren to have the same passion and they understand each other because of their position in the pack. And he's the \bad boy\.Great charactersAndrea Cremer did a great job with her characters. First of all, I liked Calla. I think she's a strong and very loyal heroine. She knows what she wants and she doesn't let anyone tell her what to do. She wants to do her own choices. She's strong enough to tell the handsome and sexy male alpha Ren that she's not one to share with other girls. She also wants to be his equal in leading the pack. She was a bit egoist by moments, but I really enjoyed the book anyway. Ren, Shay, Ansel, Bryn... I also cared for all these characters.Lack of informationI was around page 100 and there wasn't any explications about Keepers, Guardians, Searchers, etc. yet. Luckily, it was easy to understand without these information in the beginning but I think the author should have introduce a little bit of information in the beginning.An amazing cover for a good bookThe book cover (the hardcover one, not the paperback) is just incredibly gorgeous. I love the purple color and the calla lilies at the bottom. I remember being totally in love with this cover when it came out. Overall, the book was good and makes me want to read Wolfsbane but something was missing for me to make it four stars. Maybe because the main focus seemed to be the romance and it's not enough for me.
I love the look and price of the case..very sturdy ,.however anytime u grab it by the top the case will split and cause your phone to drop. Considering the price I won't complain
i like the way it look online, but in person it was too too big on me and i did not like that part.
It was not true to the size, but that was okay my daughter was able to fit it. yes tell someone.
there was nothing in this book that came with any surprise. the epilogue was far more interesting than the whole book. seems like the author wrote this just to finish up the mess she started with a mind to give Ana and Christian a happy ending.I still look forward to what will come next from EL. James, but only if it is unrelated to the damn fifty shades.
Love this piece it took some time to get it but it came from China and the seller was very polite but the crystal came out when I dropped my phone and it's no way to fix it it's easy to take off when your ready for it to come off but this product also messed up my home button it twist and moves and isn't supposed to but my home button still works
Okay phone brought it to replace a blackberry! It CANT replace a blackberry! Dumbest replacement ever! Its good for people who dont care to have high end phones. It has email, web, text, phones, picture mail etc... Its okay picture quality is gross -_- seriously no good and messages take a while to send/receive and web is superrrr slow but that cause im used to the blackberry so for others it might not seem so bad. Its okay overall. buy with caution!
This was an OK read, but lacked pace and maybe it was just me, but I found it was a bit difficult to follow
I bought this couple of months ago. it works well with the batteries comes with this but it has loose connection problem with the batteries I have (2As and 3A). I would give 3 stars just for the price.
It's suitable for my arm,not too tight or losse.Fit for Medium arm i guess. It just okey for the price!
My granddaughter celebrated her 12th birthday this year. Her theme, you guessed it, Peacock! the feathers were a little smaller than expected and fell apart quite easily if they are touched to much but in a vase they were perfect. I especially like that they were shipped earlier than said which turned out to be a really good thing.
I thought the battery will last longer but it also die to quic.just like the original one the comes with the phone.
This mask does its job very well and allows you to exhale without suffocating.  Does look a little strange on your face....
Recipes that help you with the natural way of eating.  This craft is perfect for hunters and fishermen alike.  a must read.
I WAS PLANNING ON GETTING THE LITTLE RED BOOK.I AM FACILATING AN AWOL  WHICH USES THE LITTLE RED BOOK ALONG WITH  THE BIG BOOK &amp; THE 12&amp;12.QUIT FRANKLY I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN 10 OF THEM, I MADE A MISTAKE ORDERING THEM
I like playing this game but they don't give you many tokens to play with and the tournaments take 3 tokens.
I read the book and the methodic is good with practical excersises only i received a copy with a misspelled title on the cover. The author promised me a new copy. I'm an echolocation instructor for visually impaired persons but also for instructors.
Cause I thought it was nice but it was kinda a pain in the but to put on a door
then one one of ports that hold the battery in  place pulled out with the battery didn't even notice till I tried to install battery in heli im sure its fixable with some gum and a stick lol
it look very cute but it wont hold together if you drop it.good for looks but bad for protection.
I gave this book three stars because the story was ok, but it was not very exciting. At times it was hard to follow the writers style of writing. Reading it gave me something to do on a four hour flight.
Not the best but okay to pass time. It should understand how your partner plays. It should have a better understanding of the game play.
too short. and the main character (the girl) is too vulnerable. I don't like that kind of personalities. he is too selfish
I would like it better had I received the hardware for all three stools. I have to wait 4-6 weeks to complete the set. I hope the hardware is sent as promised.
Its a good Watch specially for its Price but Its a little big and It has a few electronic options. The watch achieve my basic requirements.
I had other faux wooden blinds up before these for years until they broke and I needed to replace them.  These have no image of wood on them and they look like smooth cheap plastic also I couldn't tell by the picture even enlarged that there was no wand to open and close them.  I don't care for all the string pulls.
The shoe looks great, feels quite comfy but could be because it is quite large. I am a true size 7, and my heels slip when I walk. I have just put on gel heel grips yet my feet are popping out. Such a shame! Otherwise a good looking shoe!!
One day i saw my friends playing it and then a got the game its a dick-ting at first then it gets boring.It's a good game to play when your bored other than that its ok.
Pros: Does what it's made for. Protects the the phone from drops,dirt,car oil, ect. Adds thickness to the phone so that you can hold it better. Does not fall out of your pocket.Cons: Flash on can cause a green hue in pictures during the day (if flash is on), an at night you cant take any pictures without green over coming the whole picture.Should you get it: It's up to you, because it may or may not happen to you. If do get this type of case get the all black one.
It took a while to arrive and stuck some links but it's a nice bracelet! thinner than the photo! It looks great with a good watch!
Belt is very nice and durable.thats the good. the bad the &amp;#34;screwdriver &amp;#34; is a half inch very thin piece of metal that can't be used. And fishing kit is cheep.
Boxes were shipped from manufacturer, not retailer. They were originally &amp;#34;placed on the wrong truck.&amp;#34; and were three weeks late arriving. When they arrived, there was a huge gash in the box. Only after taking the base out could we see that the gash cracked the back panel. The retailer we ordered through, Moshya, was very unhelpful. We really wanted the piece, so we kept it. We just have to be very careful of what we put under the seat. Blankets and jackets get snagged where the crack is.Otherwise, looks nice. I'd probably rate it higher if ours arrived on time and undamaged.
It works. But I felt like the product is a little bit hard when you try to connect the mini jack. But the most important thing is that works.
As skimpy and nice this costume is, it is extremly hot! You wouldnt think that with a costume. The material sticks to you and creates alot of body heat. Normally I freaze my butt off in anything I wear so its not me. But overal it fits very nicely and skirt is not too short.
It is smaller than I expected. And less durable. The knives are sharp but the light flickers on and off at times. Would not buy again.
I purchased this for my 80-year-old father so he could wear it 24/7 (takes blood thinner). He has almost lost it several times as the clasp keeps coming open and the bracelet slips off. Most times, he doesn't even know he's lost it. I had a jeweler tighten the clasp as much as they could but it still catches on things which pulls the clasp open.  A better, more secure clasp would give this bracelet 5 stars as it is very attractive and a good solid weight.
a little awkard to use. doesn't shutdown the kindle when you close it. would have preferred a different kind of closure
This is an okay mystery. It is a little predictable but is an easy read that you can enjoy without putting a lot of thought into it. This book would be good for a doctors visit as it is entertaining.
This pad loses heat fast.  It is a good value for the price.  I wish it held in the heat longer.
The fabric is soft, which is great.  It looks like in the picture there are fold overs at the hands to cover baby from scratching herself, but its just a regular sleeve cuff.  For some reason the buttons are placed oddly... there are open flaps between buttons as baby goes about her day.  The cut is very boxy.  Not a lot of length but a LOT of extra room width-wise in the body, arms, legs...  Would probably be perfect for a chubbier baby
I read the mixed reviews and bought anyway.  Not as quality an item as I anticipated for the price.  keeping it but not blown away by it.  It is a very dim night light.
Found it hard to really get into.  A lot of characters to keeps track of.  Maybe just not my kind of book.  May be great read for other people.  Thank  you, B
I would advise looking elsewhere for a case for your nexus 5. This Spigen slim case only protects the sides of the device, leaving the top and bottom edges unprotected. Because of the nexus 5's curved top and bottom edges, the phone is left extremely susceptible to taking fall damage in those areas. Otherwise, the case feels nice, though looks somewhat unfinished with exposed button cutouts.Advice to Spigen: Offer a slim version of this case with the top and bottom edges covered.
Item is plastic, not chrome.  The silver is a metallic chrome-like finish.  I am not returning the item because I do like it, but feel that the item description is misleading.
It's a good, solid display piece made of super cheap moldable polymer. You could try to use it as a face mask, but, you'll be disappointed. Came in good time and was undamaged.
I had thought  this was gonna be a green chair but when i got it it was maroon. but it was comfy and seems sturdy
We I got the socks they looked fine.  But when I opened them for inspection there were loose threads everywhere.  It was like I bought seconds, which I don't remember them being advertised as so.
I needed a bike mount for my phone for when I go to unfamiliar places. I saw this and it looked like what I was looking for. It wasn't too expensive either. It was shipped quickly and installation was easy. It easily held my GS4 in all types of cases. I used it for directions so that I don't need to hold my phone or have earphones in to see directions. The only problem is that the phone shook a lot no matter how tight I had the mount. This shaking caused the phone's position to shift constantly. I used it quite frequently. About 4-5 times per week for 1 hour each time. I was riding around, and I hear a slight crack as I'm riding on a slightly bumpy sidewalk. Then I hit a minor bump (barely 1 inch) and the phone-holding part completely separated from the mount. I did have a very protective case on my phone, but if I didn't, my phone would have been destroyed. Honestly I only recommend this product if you are only staying on paved streets.
My phone keeps falling out of it.  This product is notot good for when talking on the phone.  Very cute though.
A readable story, not as enjoyable as others I have read but was good at the time, Didn't make me want to read the nest one too quickly but was ok.
I chose this book because I wanted a quick read. I didn't particularly like it and will not be reading any follow up story.
I bought the app and its still counting down, I don't know why. It's after the season started and I was wondering if anyone could tell me in the comments on this app, thanks!
Easy to read book that offered some good sound advice. Especially simple for a technological weakling. I recommend this book highly.
Both of the pieces were not Crucial. However So far everything is working okay.Next time please state in your ad.
Turns yellowish after using a while. Tried washing it but remains the same. Can improve with the same. Can do better.
This is a cool app for texting. I was looking for a speech to text app for my Kindle Fire hd, but this will have to do.
When my fuel was delivered, one lid was not tight. Half of the fluid had leaked out of its container. Otherwise, everything is great. Burns cleanly and efficiently.
These run a little small but they worked. I ended up having to buy a skirt to cover up how tight they were around the more private section but otherwise they did the job for an 80's party I threw.
I got this for an 80's party Im having. The colors arent as bright as in the picture, but it will do the job.
So I bought this for my T25 with high hopes.  I've been extremely happy with my T25 as well as my M20 Warrior flashlights.  My M20 is mounted to my AR, but the T25 I've been using as a hand held for night &amp;#34;ops&amp;#34; (ok it's not really op's....just night boar hunting!)  The green filter actually works great.  I like it a lot.  But I don't like the FIT of the filter on my T25.  It's on..but comes off VERY easily.  As one of the other reviewers stated, only the very top of the inside of the filter is what holds it to the flashlight. I wish it stayed on a little tighter.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not a bad product overall, as I said the filter part is good.  It's just that I'm afraid I'm going to lose this thing in the bush one night.My fix: I have a roll of 1/2 inch black gaffer's tape that I strapped around the bottom of the filter, and taped it to my T25.  So far it works.  I haven't been in the rain yet...so we'll see.  Another idea I have is to put a rubber band thru the lanyard hole and run that thru the clip, so hopefully if the filter falls off, it's still attached to the light.
It is cute but sitting on it is not as comfortable as i had hoped. I wouldnt buy another one.
Didn't stay on like the Blinc liquid liner does
The first number of games has an ad displayed after the deal. In order to get to the game you must go home then tap on Solitare again. This is very annoying.
Outfit arrived very promptly but was very disappointed in the lame' cat appique. To me it made the outfit look cheap. Cute outfit if the applique was't that Gold Lame' Stuff. It rjuined it for me.I gave this a 2 star rating because of the applique and the fact that the return date was only 10 days from date of receipt. My fault I guess for not really looking at the outfit when it 1st arrived.
the only problem is that it take forever for someone else to play. Also not evertone is as smart as i am :)
Since these rugs are reversible, there is no sticky backing and are slippery on the bathroom floor.  They're well constructed, but are very thick.  I don't know that they are going to dry out after use.
I got through this book pretty quick and it was pretty good. It has the right amount of action mixed with romance. But something didn't really wow me. The writing was also good, so that's not the issue. I didn't really connect with the characters and I don't know why because I actually liked them. Hmm... I'm so torn! I wanted to like this book so much because it seemed so great and it is pretty good, but I guess something just didn't connect me to the novel. Weird. Maybe this isn't really my type of book.If you love this genre, I really recommend it! It's a great book and fans of the genre will love it. I'm just not a big fan of action and stuff. :P Anyways, since this isn't a bad novel it deserves 3 stars!
Jep, 3 stars. That's right. That's a pretty high rating for an angel book coming from me. But then again, this is not an ordinary angel book. And still I missed something in it. I think I, as always, expected more.So this is the story of Rosa. She is a hunter, a pretty good one actually. I liked her. She was a cool main character. I liked Jason and I liked the two of them together. Now, I don't exactly know what I missed in this book... Maybe I wanted a little more action? Maybe it's the end that disappointed me? I don't know. I only know that there was something missing in this book. The writing was okay. Pretty good, but not great either. The book overall was pretty average. Maybe it just isn't my thing. If you're a fan of angel books, you'll most likely like this book too. If not, you might not like this one, but then again, this is just my opinion.
3.5 stars!Okay, I liked this story! I didn't really love it, but I liked it! And The Devil's Tattoo has got to be the coolest bandname ever. Seriously.Zoe Granger started playing guitar ever her heart was broken into a million pieces. And music has been her escape ever since. Then her best friend Dee suggest they start a band and everything goes quick after that. They call themselves The Devil's Tattoo and after releasing their first EP, it's on top of the sharts in no time. Contracts, photo shoots, interviews,... Everything has changed in such a short amount of time. Then they're asked to tour with the hot indie band The Stabs. Will is the bass player of that band and he only has eyes for Zoe, but Zoe doesn't trust guys that easy and she doesn't want her heart broken again. But Will is determined. This tour is either going to be a highway to hell or a stairway to heaven.I liked the story. It's really cool! I love music and this is pretty realistic. Things can go very quick very sudden and I liked that! The writing was good too, although it was a bit fast in the beginning and I didn't quite understand the situation between Will and Zoe because of that. It seemed like insta-love, but it wasn't. It just seemed that way because of the fact that we skip through a couple of months in the first few chapters. But it got better once they started the tour and even though I liked those two together, I kind of wanted Zoe to fall for her best friend because they were so funny together! Their conversations are hilarious and they seem like a married couple after 30 years of marriage. Seriously cool. The whole band is that way. It's like a family and I love that!I liked the characters. Zoe is cool and I get where she comes from. And I adore Dee, he's just awesome. I really liked all of them and I'm happy that I got to know them!If you love books about bands and music and friendship and all that, you'll probably like this one too. So try it out! Maybe it's something for you!
My first thought after finishing this book was: `Wow, this is a comic in book form.' And that's not a bad thing. Absolutely not. I love comics with superheroes and all that stuff. And I read this pretty quick. Got through it in less than 3 hours.This book is about Jim, a teenage boy with super powers. He moonlights as a Super Bounty Hunter under the name Mohawk and he's also known as Kid Sensation. He got into the trials of the Academy, a place where all teen with powers go to see if they can become a superhero. And because of some super ass he didn't get a chance to enter even though he was qualified.I enjoyed this book because I love all things superhero (Marvel, DC Comics, ... that sort of stuff. And elements. Let' s not forget those). Yeah, I'm a geek. But it was not really that special for me. It had a few flaws, which brought the book down a lot. It was a bit confusing with the flashbacks too. The writing was okay but there were some typos. I didn't have to think that much while reading and sometimes that's not a bad thing. But when there was a flashback, that changed and I was confused because I didn't immediately got the fact that it's a flashback. I do like the cover, it gives the book the whole comic book vibe I got when I finished it.I liked the characters, but there were cliches. I don't mind a few, but in this book, there were quite a lot of them. Overall this is a good book to read when I'm lazy and just want to put my mind off things and have a good time. It's that sort of book. And there's nothing wrong with that.
Actual rating: 3,5 starsThe Grave Winner is Lindsey's first book and yes, I noticed that sometimes in this book, but I always take that into consideration when I read because everyone makes beginners mistakes. So I tried not to pay to much attention to those. But overall this was a good debut. It was funny (hilarious at times), creepy, mysterious and just a fun read. I definitely had a good time reading it. And I'm still itchy by the way Lindsey. Nice thing you did there. Lol.I loved Leigh, she was very witty and I was really laughing out loud at times. And sarcastic. That was very relatable because my humor is usually very sarcastic to. I loved Jo and Sarah, even though Sarah was a little creepy at times... I liked Tram and Cal and all the other characters.This really is a good ghost story and a perfect book to read around Halloween (other times too, but it really reminded me of a book for Halloween, so...) Oh and I love the cover, fits the story very nice.
3.5 starsI liked this book! :) As you may or may not know, I have a weakness for books/movies about people with elemental powers, so this one belongs on that list too. It wasn't the best ever and sometimes the romance between Ryan and Natalie seemed a bit... rushed. It almost is one of those instant-love thingies you often read in books nowadays. And I'm not really a fan of that. But overall this was a fun book and I liked it. I really did. And I would read the sequel because I want to know what happens next.ARC courtesy of the author.

This model doesn't have the PS button on it so it makes it hard to use, and is impossible to use as the only controller as the PS button is heavily used. If only needing it as a secondary controller, it should work well enough.
Menu selection is not intuitive.  Display is hard to see.For this price download device should be included.  That ability would increase functionality.Chest strap should have on off switch so you don't have to detach battery after each use.  This would mean one less thing to lose.

It is exactly what it says it is. These silver pieces are very very small, about the size of a dime. They weigh 3.1 grams... which is totally not worth the price one must pay to get one. They are cute however and great gift for young collectors.
This text book arrived in a timely manner and I love that it was affordable. It's a lab manual and it had some writing in it (the first two labs were partially filled out). Other than that, it appears the rest of the manual will work out well for me.
there is not like looks in the internet picture.  The seams are not well finish.  fabric lycra costume is not thick or strong as seen in the image of the Internet.
not to bad for a slot machine. it is entertaining. something to do if you are bored. not to bad.
Since I live in FL, when this hoof polish was delivered, it was extremely hot.  When I went to open it for the very first time, it sprayed out everywhere like a shaken can of soda pop.  It is very hard to remove from my skin, even with the fingernail polish remover I used. It stained my clothes permanently.
I wanted to get a color that wasn't pink, since that is what the majority of my Gelish collection is. I though a bright purple would be cool. Color doesn't look purple at all.
Very nice
I thought they would be a bit bigger, and they are kinda hard to use. But great assortment. but only one size so I would recamend like small nails.
just ordered the 22\ premium 2 hose hookah (ocean blue), everything was great, shipping came right on time, everything looks great, then on the 2nd day, we decided to clean the hookah, and all of a sudden it shattered on us. I am unable to locate a number to contact for the supplier and am not sure what to do, not happy with the fact that the product shattered on us, i hope a refund or they can replace this for us.
Bought for my 18 mo old. He is a little young for it, but my friend's almost 3yo went right for it and played with it for a long time...and that was the last time the drill worked properly. It only lasted for ONE playtime! I have an older Fischer Price drill that I got second hand and it is still working. The insides of the ALEX drill must be the cheapest plastic they could find. This could be a really great toy if they would provide a drill that would stand up to the age group that it was built for. Hey ALEX.... can you send me a new- better drill??
A few good calm songs, a few good hard rock songs that truly kick ass. Think that the world &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; in &amp;#34;Pop Evil must really be in capital letter. The rest of the album is not bad but nothing more.
Ok book for the price its small and the pages are dull but theres quite a few puzzles in it. I would spend an extra dollar or two for a better one for the kiddos
Well amazing but hard I wold be probably recommend this app if it was easy. very fun probably an 8and up game
Noy the best album from this great artist  some highlights  hope he is`nt burned out  still remember great concerts with this man
It's simple and made cheap, the tablet slips out of the adjustable grips sometimes so I don't trust it all the time. It is what it is and it's better than nothing at all.
It's a lighter purple than whats in the picture and it doesn't say game boy, but other than that, it's somewhat what I expected.
